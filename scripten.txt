`"............You've...`
`been indulging in alcohol again, haven't you?"`
`The old physician let out a sigh as he removed the stethoscope.`
`Two elderly men could be seen in the dimly lit study, which was filled with dust and a sickly sweet stench.`
`In the corner of this room, which was much larger than what most people would call a study,`
` there was an expensive‐looking bed, a man undergoing a medical examination, and the physician conducting it.`
`{n}There was also what appeared to be a servant watching over the whole scene.`
`"The bottle is my friend.`
` It is no less of a friend than you, and it has stood by my side even longer than you have."`
`The man who had bared his chest for the stethoscope spoke unapologetically as he straightened out his clothes.`
`"............Kinzo‐{c:86EF9C:san}.`
` ...Your body only appears to be well thanks to the effects of the medicine.`
` However, if you continue to drink such strong spirits, the treatment will become meaningless.`
` ...Trust my judgment.`
` Temper your drinking."`
`"I thank you, though only for the sentiment,`
` my friend.`
` .........Genji.`
` Another glass.`
` Water it down slightly.`
` That way Nanjo can save face."`
`".........Are you quite sure?"`
`After eyeing both the master who demanded the alcohol and his doctor who forbade it,`
` Genji, the old butler, silently gave a slight nod and carried out his master's orders faithfully.`
`Nanjo, the man's personal doctor, let out a deep sigh once again as he watched the butler busy himself alongside the liquor cabinet...`
`There was a smell filling up the room.`
`...This sweet, poisonous aroma felt as though it melted the heart, if not the soul itself.`
` It was the smell of that venomous green drink that the man couldn't bring himself to part from.`
`"......Nanjo.`
` You are my close friend of many years.`
` I am deeply grateful for all that you have done to keep me alive this long."`
`"I have done nothing.`
` ......After all, you never listen to my advice as your physician."`
`"Hahahaha...`
` And you never listen when I warn you about a mistaken chess move you're about to make.`
` It seems we are even."`
`"......My lord."`
`"Thank you.`
` ......I wouldn't die if I ran out of your medicine, but I would if I ran out of this."`
`With one eye on Nanjo, who had his face set in a resigned expression, Kinzo took the glass that Genji was holding out to him.`
`...There are probably very few people who would associate the venomous color which filled the glass with an alcoholic beverage.`
`".........Nanjo.`
` Be honest with me.`
` How much time do I have left?"`
`"Well now...`
` How short must I make it to get you to stop drinking?"`
`Nanjo once again let out a sigh of resignation.`
`{n}As he watched Kinzo down the glass regardless, he spoke.`
`".........You don't have much time."`
`"...What precisely do you mean by that?"`
`"......Let us illustrate it with the chess game here.`
` You are closing out the game quite well, but I do not ultimately see you cornering my king."`
`Nanjo's gaze was directed at a side table with a stately chess set placed on top of it.`
`Judging by the positioning of the pieces, the match was well into the endgame.`
`{n}The black rook and bishop were cutting deeply into the enemy lines.`
`The white king had already been castled and cornered, so that even an amateur could see that the match would reach its conclusion before too long.`
`Every time Nanjo came to give a medical examination, both of them would make a few moves.`
`Nanjo was stating with confidence that Kinzo would most likely fall into his eternal sleep before this game could be concluded.`
`...These were less the words of a physician than they were the words of an old friend.`
`"............Were you a normal patient,`
` I would recommend that you write a will at this point."`
`"......And what is a will, Nanjo?`
` Handwritten instructions to the vultures on how to devour and scatter my corpse?"`
`"No, not at all.`
` ......As the word suggests, it is a way for you to record your will for later generations.`
` It is far more than just a means to divide up your inheritance."`
`"Hoh.`
` ......And apart from the division of the inheritance, what might I write of?"`
`"............Oh, there's your regrets...`
`and matters you have left unfinished.`
` Things you want to be passed down...`
`...and things you want to tell.`
` ......Anything you want."`
`"......Hmph.`
` .........Things I want to be passed down and things I want to tell?`
` Ridiculous.`
` I, Ushiromiya Kinzo, have not one thing I want to tell or leave behind!!"`
`"I was born with nothing.`
` I will die with nothing!`
` There is nothing I wish to leave to my foolish children!!`
` Even if the end were to come today—even if it were to come right now!`
` I shall accept this fate of death without a trace of fear!!"`
`"......Kinzo‐san."`
`"I created everything.`
` My fortune!`
` My prestige!`
` Everything!!`
` Those were built up by me, and they will be lost along with me.`
` There is nothing I wish to leave behind!!"`
`"Nothing!!`
` After I'm gone, I care not if it all goes to waste!`
` I desire no tomb, no coffin!!`
` Those were the terms of the contract I made with the witch!`
` When I die, everything will be lost!`
` That has been part of the promise since the beginning, and that's why nothing will be left behind.`
` There is nothing I can leave behind!!"`
`After reaching a furious crescendo, Kinzo suddenly slumped over.`
`...His expression was limp and feeble, as though an evil spirit had possessed him and then left.`
`"..................`
` However, I do have one regret.`
` I have nothing to leave behind, but there is one thing I cannot leave undone..."`
`".........You would do well to write it down.`
` Of course, it would be best if you could finish it before your time comes.`
` However, even if the worst happens, those who come after you will carry it to completion.`
` You must leave behind your regrets so that they can be resolved even if you are unable to do so yourself.`
` ......That is the purpose of a will."`
`When Nanjo tried to gently pat Kinzo's shoulder, the dying man flew into a sudden rage and batted away Nanjo's hand.`
`"That is no good, no good, no good!!"`
`"It must be done while I still live! At the moment of my death, my soul will be devoured by the demons of the contract and wiped out of existence!`
` For me, there will be no peace or another world after death!`
` That's why everything must be done before I go!!`
` That's why a will has no meaning for me!!"`
`"And if I had the time to write such a thing...`
` ...If I had such time to spare!!`
` ...I'd want to see it.`
` I'd want to see it one more time!`
` I want to see {f:5:Beatrice}'s smiling face one last time!!"`
`"Oh, {f:5:Beatrice}, why do you resist me so?!`
` I would return everything you have given me right this very moment—I am prepared to lose everything!!`
` So please, show me your smile just one more time..."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}, I beg of you—you must be able to hear this final plea—that's the kind of woman you are!`
` I beg of you, show yourself to me!!`
` You're here, aren't you?!`
` You're standing there invisible, listening to every word I say, and even now you're mocking me from somewhere in this room, aren't you?!"`
`"Please, appear before me one more time and smile!!`
` Feel free to scold me, even snatch away my life by your own hands if you wish!!`
` I don't want to die alone like this!!`
` I cannot let myself die until I've seen your smile just one more time!!"`
`"Aah, {f:5:Beatrice}, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` I offer up this life of mine, I offer it up to you!!`
` I'm begging you, {f:5:Beatriceeeeee}!!!"`
`"Whoa...`
` Things sure move with the times...`
` I can't believe we'll be able to make the trip in just twenty minutes..."`
`I couldn't help but scratch my head and marvel at how far things have come in recent years.`
`{n}We used to go by boat.`
`Back then, we were all forced to endure nearly half a day of swaying back and forth over the sea before we reached Niijima.`
` Things have gotten so much more convenient these days.`
`Still, I've never been on a plane this small.`
`{n}I've flown in a huge jumbo jet before, but this will be my first experience in such a tiny one.`
`...It's going to shake, isn't it...`
` They say that smaller boats shake more, so I guess the same rule probably applies to planes.`
`...Aaah, just spare me.`
`"Haahahaha, don't worry, Battler‐kun.`
` It'll shake much less than that boat did."`
`"Gyah?! ...I‐is that you, George‐{c:86EF9C:aniki}?!"`
`"Heheh, don't scare me like that... You just shaved three years off my life.`
` Anyway, what's shaking got to do with anything?"`
`"Ihihihi, you don't think I'm actually scared of the plane shaking or maybe falling out of the sky or something, ri~ght?"`
`"Oh, of course not, my mistake.`
` I'm sure that you've changed a lot since we last saw you.`
` After all, it's been six years since then.`
` You're not a kid anymore.`
` Hahahahaha."`
`"Sheesh, and here you are, old enough to smoke and drink.`
` I've got no interest in smoking, but I've always wanted to try some booze, heheheh!`
` Well, if you've got your dad's genes, I'll bet you can hold your own when it comes to drinking, right?"`
`"Well, I usually drink for business rather than pleasure.`
` It's pretty hard to do business in Japan without it."`
`"Ihihihi!`
` That's exactly right!`
` So I was thinking I'd take my first shot at it tonight at dinner!"`
`"Th‐that's no good, Battler‐kun, you're still a minor!`
` Drinking alcohol is known to stunt the growth of minors and...`
`...um, never mind."`
`"Come on, I'm tall enough already!`
` In fact, it'd be easier to find clothes if I shrunk a little!"`
`I puffed my chest out proudly.`
`Until I hit my growth spurt, my height was below average in my class.`
`But then, I grew and grew, and before I knew it, I was over 180 cm.`
`I guess I have all that muscle training and those shady mail‐order performance‐enhancing drugs to thank for that.`
`Before then, I'd never dreamed that I'd shoot ten centimeters above George‐aniki, who'd reached his peak height early on.`
`......Damn, I'll bet my relatives all say "look how big you've grown, Battler‐chan!" or something.`
`...That kind of thing is really embarrassing, so I hope they cut me a break.`
`Anyway, my name, "Battler"...`
`...well, it's pretty damn weird, don't you think?`
`I've got to wonder what my parents were thinking when they gave me that name.`
`{n}I've never met anyone who could read it right the first time.`
`I usually get called "{c:86EF9C:Sento‐kun}".`
`{n}Too bad, swing and a miss.`
`My name is written {p:0:右代宮 戦人}.`
`{n}Can you read it?`
` The first part is my family name, "Ushiromiya".`
` That's a fairly plausible Japanese pronunciation so far.`
`The problem is my own name.`
`{n}.........{p:0:戦人} is made up of the characters for "fight" and "person", and it's pronounced "Battler".`
`Put it all together, and you've got Ushiromiya Battler.`
`Pretty crazy, right?`
` It's crazy enough that my parents decided to call me that, but it's even more crazy that some government worker let them make it official.`
` ...Both groups are at the top of my must‐kill list.`
`Anyway, this is one of my cousins.`
`His name is {p:0:右代宮 譲治}, pronounced Ushiromiya George.`
`He's five years older than me, so he's probably turning 23 this year.`
`{n}Since the Ushiromiya cousins consist of two boys and three girls, I ended up playing with George all the time.`
`And because I've always thought of him as a big brother, I still call him "Aniki" today.`
`"Whoo, Battler‐kun, look how big you've gotten.`
` You know what they say, "leave a boy for three days and you'll hardly recognize him"!"`
`"It must be in his blood, I suppose.`
` Rudolf wasn't that tall either until around his high school years.`
` Perhaps people end up taller if their growth spurt comes late."`
`"Nah, it's nothing special.`
` A real man needs to be tough on the inside too!"`
`"Exactly!`
` Battler‐kun here knows how it works!`
` Real men win or lose based on what they've got on the inside!`
` Can't ever forget to keep up your trainin' and discipline.`
` You do that, wait verrry alertly for the perfect moment...and strike!"`
`"Now, even I never imagined that I'd become the company president I am today, master of my own domain...`
` Yep, to think I've come this far after starting out penniless and ruined...!"`
`This portly and slightly chubby man...`
`is George‐aniki's dad, Uncle Hideyoshi ({p:0:秀吉}).`
`He's the husband of Dad's older sister.`
`{n}In other words, we're not blood‐related.`
`He's nice to children, sociable all the time, even quick to give out some spending money to us kids—simply put, he's an awesome uncle.`
`He speaks in an odd and very noticeable Kansai‐style dialect seemingly of his own creation, but he's actually a natural‐born Kanto man.`
`Apparently, leaving an impression is everything in the business world,`
` so speaking in a different style than other people is an act that makes him stick out more.`
`......However, I hear that he gets embarrassed when talking within earshot of a real Kansai person, so he switches back to standard Japanese.`
`...I don't really get it, but he's definitely an interesting person.`
`"If only you weren't so quick to brag about your life's story.`
` That's enough for now, I think.`
` I'm sure Battler‐kun's getting tired of it.`
` Aren't you?"`
`"Nope, not at all, hihihi!`
` Nothing wrong with that.`
` I think it's pretty cool for a man to have some stories he can brag about.`
` I don't have anything like that at all."`
`"Oh, really?`
` I'd imagine a man with your looks would leave girls crying left and right, so I have trouble believing that you have nothing at all to brag about..."`
`"Nonononono!`
` Y‐y‐`
`you're joking, right?!`
` Of course nothing weird like that's ever happened to me!`
` In fact, if you know anyone, I'm all ears!"`
`"Oh, I'm sure you do have some stories!`
` ...*giggle* You must tell your aunt all about it later.`
` After all, George never comes to me with anything of the sort.`
` Heheheh..."`
`This is my aunt and George‐aniki's mother, Auntie Eva ({p:0:絵羽}).`
`She's my dad's older sister.`
`{n}She and Uncle Hideyoshi are a pair of jokers, and they've always teased me back as far as I can remember.`
`This sometimes made them a bit hard to get along with when I was small.`
`{n}...That said, I'm currently in the process of discovering that they still are hard to get along with.`
`Even so, George‐aniki's family is interesting and fun, and they seem to get along just fine.`
`......Sheesh, that's pretty much the total opposite of my family.`
`"Battler‐kun,`
` have you seen Rudolf‐san?"`
`"Huh?`
` He headed off to the bathroom a while ago.`
` Is he {i:still} not back?`
` Heh, maybe the poor geezer dropped dead... {c:86EF9C:Namunamunamu}."`
`"That's no way to talk about your own father.`
` Still, this isn't the first time he's taken so long in the bathroom."`
`"Yeah, the guy's always been that way.`
` Does he really have to take a magazine with him every time he needs to take a dump?`
` Oh, what on Earth might he be doing with those?!`
` Ihihi!"`
`"Oh, you don't need to worry about that at all.`
` As long as we're together, I won't be letting him do that on his own."`
`"Hihihi!`
` Oooh, I'll have to get the juicy details later!`
` Sounds like Dad's got his balls in an iron grip."`
`"You know exactly what would happen with that man if I didn't keep a tight grip, don't you?"`
`"Oh, no kidding.`
` You're the only one capable of reigning in that old bastard.`
` As his son, I'm more than happy to let you take over."`
`"Yes, leave it all to me.`
` After all, that's my specialty."`
`This woman is my dad's wife.`
`Her name is Ushiromiya Kyrie ({p:0:霧江}).`
`As you can probably tell from our conversation, she's not my real mother.`
`{n}She's basically my stepmother.`
`My real mom died six years ago.`
`{n}Kyrie‐san is the woman Dad married afterwards.`
`I mean, I'm not a kid anymore.`
`{n}It's way too late now for me to start calling his second wife "Mom".`
`And I doubt she feels like using the word "son" on this massive kid who's no relation to her at all.`
`We aren't little kids.`
`{n}We know there's nothing to be gained by fighting.`
`So, we decided that we wouldn't force ourselves to pretend that we were family.`
`{n}I've decided to act a bit more frank with her, as though she's a friendly neighbor instead.`
`It's much easier to just keep a little distance, instead of forcing ourselves to act all close and making each other uncomfortable.`
`Kyrie‐san has been very open about all this, and thanks to that, we've been able to get along pretty well.`
`As we were capitalizing on Dad being away in the bathroom to badmouth him,`
` the man himself came back, wiping his hands with a handkerchief.`
`"Hmm?`
` Battler."`
`"Hey, what's up, Dad?"`
`"...Owowowowww!`
` Don't pinch my ear, gaah!"`
`"So, you've been talking trash about me with Mom again, haven't you?`
` What makes it so hard to show a little respect for your father, hmm?"`
`"Owowow, owowowowow!`
` Dammit, that hurts, you old bastard!`
` Stretch my ear all you want, I'm still not gonna be able to fly—owwwww!!"`
`"C'mon now.`
` Upwards,`
` upwards,`
` sideways,`
` sideways,`
` round in a circle,`
` back the other way,`
` multiplier maxed out,`
` with an extra x2 on top!`
` Now say "Father, please forgive me for being so rude"."`
`"Like hell I will, go find yourself some members‐only store if you want it that much!`
` Gyaah, let goooo!!"`
`......This old bastard is my dad.`
`{n}I think I'm pretty tall, but Dad's about the same height.`
`It's probably no surprise that Auntie Eva started talking about Dad's blood when she saw my height.`
`By the way, my height isn't the only thing I got from him.`
`{n}It seems having weird names runs in the family.`
`Dad's full name is written {p:0:右代宮 留弗夫}.`
`......Can you read it?`
` Not many could, I'll tell you that.`
`{n}That mess of characters is pronounced "Rudolf".`
`Haha...he must hate Grandfather for giving him that name.`
`Still, that's no reason to pass that weird naming tradition onto me.`
`As the old bastard twisted my ear all over the place, Auntie Eva snuck up behind him and grabbed his ear.`
`"Hey, Rudolf?`
` Don't take your frustrations out on your kid."`
`"Gyaah, that hurts, Aneki..."`
`The scene before me was a perfect realization of the trope of the older sister who deals out punishment to her prankster younger brother despite his size.`
`"I think that's good enough for now, Eva nee‐san.`
` I'll make sure to stretch out his other ear later on."`
`"Oh, my apologies.`
` I must leave some pulling for you to do, Kyrie‐san."`
`"Rudolf?`
` Make sure Kyrie‐san gives you lots and lots of punishment later on, alright?"`
`"You're one to talk, Aneki, bullying your little brother like that."`
`"Hideyoshi nii‐san, I'd like to thank you very much for picking her up.`
` If you hadn't been so generous, she'd still be unsold in the store.`
` You have my gratitude and apologies."`
`"...Hmm~?!`
` Who are you calling "unsold"?"`
`After taking two or three steps back,`
` Auntie Eva unleashed one of her beautiful high reverse roundhouse kicks, which stopped just a centimeter away from the tip of Dad's nose.`
`After starting out with Tai‐chi‐chuan for her figure, Auntie Eva had then developed an interest in the Chinese martial arts.`
` After that, she went through karate, taekwondo, capoeira, ...and what is it she's learning now, again?`
`...Well, anyway, they say a woman's weapons are in her lower body, and that's literally true for Auntie Eva.`
`"Rudo~lf?`
` Did you know that a single direct blow to the side of the head like that would knock you unconscious?`
` Not so long ago, I accidentally connected in a practice match, and my opponent was out cold."`
`"...Sheesh, what a pain.`
` Guess I have to apologize for her tendency to lash out with her feet, too."`
`Dad, completely unfazed, shrugged and smiled ironically at Uncle Hideyoshi.`
`"Wahahaha, never had a brother or sister myself.`
` So, when I see you two bickerin' with each other, it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.`
` It sure is nice to have a big family and siblings."`
`"Oh, then why not consider making a little brother for George‐kun?`
` He's already a fine adult who's about to go off on his own, so it might be a good time to have another child."`
`"Hey, have a little sympathy for the new kid and all the pain and suffering he'd have to live through.`
` I'm surprised even George‐kun turned out as well as he did after being born from this sinister sister of mine."`
`"And what an awesome kid he is.`
` Please share some of that with our blockhead of a son someday, will you?"`
`"That's not how it worked.`
` It's thanks to Eva nee‐san's proper rearing that George‐kun became the good, gentle kid he is now.`
` Isn't that right, Nee‐san?"`
`"Oh, come now...heheh, you think so...?`
` Our George still has a long way to go."`
`"Ah, by the way, how's your little Ange‐chan doing?`
` I heard she was vomiting?"`
`"Oh, that's right!`
` And I was hopin' to finally see her face after such a long time.`
` Is she alright?"`
`"She often catches a cold when the seasons change.`
` She's very frail...`
` I did want to bring her along, but we decided to have my family look after her this time."`
`"I think that's a wise move.`
` She'll be on the mend faster if she's not exposed to that toxic head house.`
` A child's health is always more important than an adult's convenience, don't you think?"`
`"I know of some great medicine for vomitin' colds like that!`
` When we get back home, I'll send it over right away, so be sure to give her some!"`
`"Thank you very much, Hideyoshi nii‐san.`
` I'm always in your debt..."`
`...And once the conversation suddenly veered off in that direction, we kids didn't have any chance of butting in.`
`For now, I'm just happy that Auntie Eva gave Dad his just deserts for tugging on my ear.`
`"Looks like we're still waiting for the weather report."`
`George‐aniki pointed at the counter.`
`{n}The "Pending Weather Clearance" sign was still stuck next to the scheduled departure time for the flight we were scheduled to board.`
`According to Aniki, smaller planes are more subject to winds and other effects of the weather,`
` and it's not at all uncommon for flights to be delayed because of that.`
`......Wait a sec, it isn't really going to shake...is it...?`
`From down here on the ground, it just looks cloudy, not windy.`
`...Well, I guess it's different up where the planes fly.`
`"The weather's a bit uncertain today."`
`Auntie Eva was looking at a TV in the lounge.`
`{n}The weather forecast was being broadcast, informing us that a typhoon was approaching the Kanto region.`
`"A typhoon again?`
` ......I guess we're doomed to these, with the family conference being in October every year.`
` Couldn't he choose a better season?"`
`"I agree.`
` I've always hoped we could have it sometime around the Obon festival in mid‐August.`
` In that case, why don't you suggest that to Father and Nii‐san during the conference?"`
`"...Very funny.`
` Why don't you do it yourself?`
` Our brother would never listen to anything I suggested."`
`"No way.`
` It doesn't really bother me that much to have it in October.`
` You were the one who complained about the typhoon, so I said "ask them to change it then",`
` that's all."`
`"I only said that typhoons always come around this time of year.`
` You're the one who said you wanted to move it nearer to Obon."`
`"Well, you said it too last year!`
` Didn't you say that it would be easier to fit into your schedule if we had it nearer Obon?!"`
`"I've never said anything like that."`
`"Oh yes, you did.`
` I certainly wouldn't forget something like that!"`
`"No, I didn't... You're the one saying that all the time!"`
`"Are you aware?`
` Stopping a kick just a hair's breadth away is a very high‐level technique."`
`"Sheesh, women your age should be more proper than that!"`
`Dad and Auntie Eva's argument looks no different from a couple of brats bickering...`
`"I expect that's because, although they normally act as mothers and fathers,`
` they turn right back into kids again when they meet their old siblings at these family conferences."`
`"You're the one who looks like a real adult, analyzing it all calmly.`
` ......I hope I never turn out like that old bastard.`
` I'd much rather end up as an intellectual adult like you, Aniki."`
`"Like me?`
` Oh, I still have a long way to go.`
` I still have very little experience out there in the real world, and I need to work on becoming more bold and sociable.`
` ...I think you've far surpassed me on all of those counts, Battler‐kun.`
` I'm sure you'll outstrip me fast enough when you become an adult."`
`George‐aniki scratched his head and laughed, as though trying to hide his embarrassment.`
`{n}Of course, he was just being humble.`
`Aniki entered a university and became an apprentice at Uncle Hideyoshi's company at the same time, studying both academics and how to become a business emperor in parallel.`
`Then, right after graduating, he got into Uncle Hideyoshi's company as his father's aide, piling up a lot of real‐life experience as he devoted himself zealously to his work.`
`He even has grand dreams, of one day standing on his own and becoming lord of his own domain.`
`Aniki is a real paragon of a man, sparing no effort as he strives towards his goal.`
` It's no exaggeration to say that I really respect him.`
`And then there's me.`
` I'm nothing at all like Aniki.`
`I'm living my happy‐go‐lucky idle high‐school life to the max.`
`I've got no dreams for the future!`
`{n}I'd like to just sit back, stay cool, and let the money flow in, but of course that could never happen.`
`...When Aniki was my age, he had already formed an impressive objective and had started devoting himself towards studying for that goal, so I guess I can't compare at all.`
`My dad just says "sure you can study at my company, if you like cleaning toilets".`
`Dammit, I'm not gonna be in the debt of that old bastard.`
`{n}I'll find my way myself!`
`{n}.........I guess that intensity is my one qualification towards adulthood.`
`Should I go on one of those self‐searching journeys that are all the rage these days?`
`{n}......Well, it's not like I could mooch off my parents for that kind of money...`
`"......hm?! Ohh~!"`
`Right then, Uncle Hideyoshi shouted out loudly.`
`{n}Uncle's a really nice person on the whole, but he does have a problem controlling the volume of his voice.`
`When I looked over, I saw that he was greeting Auntie Rosa, who had come late.`
`"Ohoooooooooh!!!`
` If it isn't Rosa‐san!`
` Maria‐chan, long time no see!!"`
`"Long time no seee!`
` Uu!"`
`"Maria!`
` Shouldn't that be "It's good to see you again"?`
` Greet your uncle properly."`
`"Uu.`
` It's...good to see you again..."`
`"There you go!`
` Well said!`
` How about some candy as a reward?!`
` ......Oh, huh?`
` Where'd I put 'em..."`
`"Rosa‐san, it's good to see you again.`
` It's good to see you too, Maria‐chan."`
`"It's been too long, Kyrie nee‐san, Hideyoshi nii‐san."`
`"...And...`
`...oh my, Battler‐kun?!`
` Look how big you've gotten...!"`
`"Ah, come on, hahaha...`
` It's embarrassing hearing that from every person I meet...!"`
`"Hey, Rosa.`
` You're late.`
` If the plane was on time, you'd barely have made it..."`
`"I'm sorry.`
` We had some trouble making our train connection.`
` So we're waiting on the weather yet again?"`
`"Oh, don't complain.`
` I much prefer the thirty‐minute plane trip to spending six hours bouncing about on a boat.`
` Even if we're kept waiting here for an hour, it's still much faster overall."`
`"Maria‐chan's gotten huge too!!`
` So, how tall are you now?"`
`"Uu!`
` So, how tall am I now?!"`
`Maria parroted Uncle Hideyoshi's question, looking up at her mother.`
`I guess she doesn't remember her own height.`
`{n}She's probably right in the middle of a growth spurt, so her height must change every month.`
`In just a few more years, she'll probably start looking very feminine.`
`"Umm, ...how tall were you the last time you got measured...?`
` She just keeps getting bigger and bigger.`
` Don't you?"`
`"Uu!"`
`"I think she's grown a lot since last year.`
` Let's see, she turned nine years old this year, didn't she?"`
`"Nine years old.`
` Uu."`
`"That's right, you're nine years old now.`
` Glad to see you're doing well too, Maria‐chan!"`
`"Up you...`
`...nng...`
` I guess you've gotten a bit too heavy to play airplane with..."`
`"George‐aniki, what a rude thing to say to a lady.`
` Here, I'll do it... Up ya go~..."`
`"......Uu."`
`When I went to lift her up in Aniki's place, Maria stiffened defensively, staring suspiciously at my face.`
`...Ah, that's right.`
` The last time I met Maria, it was six years ago, and she was only three years old.`
`Of course she doesn't remember my face.`
`"Maria‐chan, don't you remember?`
` It's Battler‐kun.`
` You used to play together, remember?"`
`".........Uu."`
`"I doubt you'll have any luck.`
` The last time she met Battler, she was only three.`
` You don't keep memories at that age."`
`She must know everyone's face apart from mine because she meets them every year, but I haven't had contact with the Ushiromiya family for about six years now.`
`So, it's no surprise that this nine‐year‐old girl doesn't have any memories of me.`
`Even I can only just barely remember her being a three‐year‐old crybaby.`
`"Maria.`
` This is Battler onii‐chan.`
` Uncle Rudolf's son.`
` ...Understand?"`
`"............Uncle's son is...`
` Uncle's the son...`
` ............??`
` ......Uuuu!!"`
`That "uu" was probably the sound of her brain breaking, unable to understand the complicated explanation.`
`I guess it was a bit too confusing for her.`
`"Maria‐chan.`
` This is Battler‐kun.`
` He's your cousin, like me."`
`"......Like George onii‐chan?`
` ...........................Battler?`
` Cousin?`
` ......Uu."`
`"That's right.`
` You got it."`
`This part of Aniki is what makes me really look up to him.`
`For someone who isn't married, he's just great at dealing with kids.`
`{n}I'm sure that he'll be an indulgent father in the future.`
`"...Battler onii‐chan?"`
`Maria looked straight at me with a questioning expression, as though asking whether it was alright to call me that.`
`"Yep, that's me, Battler.`
` Nice to meet you, Maria!"`
`"Uu!`
` Battler!"`
`"Maria!`
` You mustn't address him without honorifics—call him Battler onii‐chan...!"`
`"It's cool, Auntie Rosa.`
` I don't sweat the small stuff.`
` Right, Maria?!`
` We're buddies on a first‐name basis, us two, aren't we?!"`
`"Battler, Battler, Battleeerrr!`
` Uu‐uu!"`
`"That's right, Maria, Maria, Mariaaa!`
` Uu‐uu!!"`
`We horsed around for a while to make up for the six‐year gap in our friendship.`
`She probably still thinks of me as nothing more than a big new friend, but things'll probably work out as we get to know each other again.`
`But I'm surprised.`
` She's just the way I remembered her being six years ago.`
`Seems that people just don't change that much after all.`
`{n}I'm a bit happy that she's still the pure, innocent girl I remember.`
`Her name is written {p:0:真里亞}.`
`{n}...That one's not so difficult to read.`
` Of course, it says "Maria".`
`{n}The third character looks like a cross, which is pretty cool.`
`Her feelings don't usually show up on her face, so it can be difficult to know just what she's thinking, but that's just how she looks on the outside.`
`{n}On the inside, she's just a sweet, normal girl.`
`Then there's Maria's mother, Auntie Rosa.`
`{n}She's my dad's younger sister.`
`Rosa is written {p:0:楼座}.`
` ...Here's a name that's totally not Japanese.`
`Sorry to say it, but her name's almost as ridiculous as Dad's...`
` I've got to respect her for not ending up as screwed up as he is.`
`...When I think about it, all the names in my family sound foreign.`
`{n}Just why is Grandfather so obsessed with this?`
`Because of him, even us grandchildren have to put up with this weird naming sense.`
`{n}It's even more annoying since Grandfather's own name is perfectly normal.`
`Anyway, there's one thing about Auntie Rosa that's a relief compared to the other family members.`
`The old bastard and Auntie Eva have this annoying urge to tease and mock people all the time,`
` but even though she shares their blood, Auntie Rosa isn't like that at all.`
`She has the most common sense among all the siblings.`
`Like Uncle Hideyoshi, she's a kind aunt who'll always be on the kids' side.`
`......However, possibly because she's more strict as a parent, she's not liberal with handing out spending money like Uncle Hideyoshi is.`
`Alright.`
` Now we have the entire group of family members who are going to board the plane.`
`As though it had waited for us all to gather, an announcement rang out through the lobby.`
`"Our apologies for the wait.`
` Boarding will now commence for flight 201 to Niijima.`
` We ask that the passengers please form two lines in front of the counter, behind the white line."`
`"Rosa, you still haven't gone through boarding procedures, right? Hurry up."`
`"Oh no...!`
` Maria, come on!"`
`"Uu!"`
`We had to go through a metal detector before going out on the runway.`
`Our small plane wasn't as massive as an international flight, but it was still a plane.`
` A staff member holding a metal detector checked us all.`
`Once all of us cleared the check, we followed the staff member out onto the runway.`
`Come to think of it, everyone here is in the Ushiromiya family.`
`It's like this is a reserved charter flight or something.`
`Our group stopped in front of the entrance to the airplane.`
`{n}Then, our guide turned around and spoke, looking down at the passenger list as she did.`
`"Boarding will now commence.`
` As I call out the names on the passenger list,`
` please take your seats in order, starting from the front row on the right side and going right to left, then onto the next row.`
` I will now begin reading the passenger list.`
` Ushiromiya Hideyoshi‐sama!"`
`"Oh, I'm first!`
` Right here!`
` ...By the way, do you have the candies, Eva?`
` I've been lookin' all over for 'em, but I can't find 'em."`
`"Ushiromiya Eva‐sama."`
`"They're in my handbag.`
` I'll get them once we're inside the plane."`
`I've heard that candies are a good way to protect your ears from hurting due to variations in atmospheric pressure when landing or taking off.`
` That's probably what they're talking about.`
`"...Hope I get a window seat!"`
`"Hahaha, don't worry.`
` There aren't any other kinds of seats."`
`According to George‐aniki, there are apparently only two lines of seats.`
`Yep, it's a small plane alright...`
` .........It isn't really going to shake...is it...?`
`"Ushiromiya George‐sama."`
`"Right here.`
` Don't worry, Battler‐kun.`
` It won't shake too much."`
`"Ushiromiya Battler‐sama."`
`"A‐Aniki, how much is "not too much"?!`
` You can just swim if you fall from a boat, but if a plane crashes you're screwed, right?!`
` We all get our own parachutes in our seats, don't we?`
` Wait, we don't?!"`
`"Ushiromiya Rudolf‐sama."`
`"Come on, Battler, quit being a wuss and get in."`
`"Ow! Dad!`
` Don't push me!`
` We don't get parachutes!"`
`"Ushiromiya Kyrie‐sama."`
`"Alright, stop fooling around.`
` Let's move along."`
`"Ow! Kyrie!`
` Don't push me!`
` This blockhead isn't moving forward!"`
`"Ushiromiya Maria‐sama."`
`"Uu!`
` Forward, forward!"`
`"Ushiromiya Rosa‐sama."`
`"Maria!`
` Keep quiet..."`
`"This is your pilot, Kawabata.`
` We'd like to thank you for taking New Tokyo Aviation's flight 201 today.`
` We estimate that the flight to Niijima Airport will take about twenty minutes."`
`"We are receiving reports of atmospheric turbulence.`
` There might be some shaking of the aircraft, so we ask that you do not unfasten your seat belts after takeoff."`
`"A‐Aniki, did that guy just say we needed to wear seatbelts?!`
` In a jumbo jet, they let you undo them after takeoff!`
` So it's gonna shake so much we can't take them off?!"`
`"Dammit, you tricked me, it is going to shake after all!`
` Where are the parachutes?!`
` I knew I should've taken the boooooaaaaat!!"`
`".........Should've taken the boat...`
`......the boat......"`
`"Gonna faaalll!`
` Gonna faaalll!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Maria, that's enough!"`
`"......But what a surprise.`
` I thought there was nothing that could scare Battler‐kun."`
`"This guy can't handle vehicles for some reason.`
` Always yells about falling and sinking and stuff.`
` You're a disgrace of a man, you are."`
`"......Urgh, shut up.`
` That thing was seriously shaking way too much...`
` I just got a little stressed, since it was my first time on a small plane like that..."`
`"You call that "a little stressed"?`
` Heheheh, sounds like it'd be fun to take an overseas vacation with you, Battler‐kun.`
` Would you like to go to Egypt with your aunt?`
` You'd get to ride a plane for a full 14 hours!"`
`"Ahhahaha!`
` There's a good plan.`
` Battler‐kun, you should go let Eva nee‐san toughen you up some.`
` But boy were you hilarious!`
` Ahhahahaha!"`
`"Wahhahaha, now, now. Everyone's got their own strong and weak points.`
` It's bad to laugh at 'em.`
` Wahhahaha...!"`
`"D‐Dad, you're laughing too.`
` Hey, Maria‐chan, you shouldn't laugh anymore."`
`"Shouldn't laugh anymore?`
` Uu!"`
`Gyah, dammit!`
` Is being scared of planes really such a big deal?`
`{n}Everyone obviously thinks I'm a big oaf now...`
` Tch!`
`We split up and took separate taxis from the airport to the harbor.`
`{n}From there on, we would be taking a boat to the island.`
`The islands are right next to each other, so it's not that far.`
`{n}It would be a leisurely thirty minutes by boat.`
`As we arrived at the pier where the boat to the island was anchored, we saw a silhouette waving its hand.`
`"George nii‐saaan!`
` It's been so frickin' long!!"`
`"Ah, Jessica‐chan, it's been a year since I saw you!`
` You've gotten taller again, haven't you?"`
`"Kyahaha, don't gimme that, it's embarrassing hearing that every year!"`
`"......H‐hey, Aniki, you've gotta be kidding me.`
` That's really Jessica?!"`
`"Wait a sec, George nii‐san...`
` This massive beast...`
`is Battler?!"`
`We both stared each other down.`
`...She definitely didn't look this grown‐up in my memories, but I do remember her {c:86EF9C:crazy way of talking}.`
`"Yo, Jessica!`
` What's this now!`
` You're kidding me, you look like a woman now!`
` What're these, boobs? Even you managed to get a chest!`
` Ihihi, let me rub 'em, let me~!"`
`"Hey, screw you, I'm a blushing flower of 18!`
` Just like hair grows out, so'll other stuff!`
` You think I got boobs just so you can go and rub 'em, loser?!`
` And what about you, got anything to back up that ridiculous size?!`
` Did you remember to grow any actual muscle?!"`
`"You'd better believe it, I'll show you how much training I've piled up since back then!!"`
`"Oh, cram it!!`
` I'll beat you at your own game!"`
`This headstrong girl's name is Ushiromiya {p:0:朱志香}.`
`......She was born under the same unlucky star as me, sharing the same kind of weird name.`
` You see, {p:0:朱志香} is pronounced "Jessica".`
`She's Dad's older brother's daughter.`
`That older brother happens to be the eldest son of the Ushiromiya family, so I guess that also technically makes Jessica a direct heir to the Ushiromiya family.`
`Since Jessica and I are the same age and had that type of boy‐girl rivalry between us,`
` we've always been used to fighting and joking around together whenever the relatives gathered.`
`Jessica grew more quickly, so she always had me beat in terms of size and physical strength.`
`So, when we scuffled as a contest of strength like this, it usually went Jessica's way.`
`So even though I clearly understand that I'm bigger now, I still feel like I can't win against Jessica with my strength.`
`"Hnng! Ghhh......!!"`
`"............Woh...ah...!`
` What the...what're you...getting all serious for...?!`
` Owowow..."`
`"Hey hey hey, this is nothin'!`
` Jessica, you've gotten weak."`
`"Sh‐shut up.`
` I'm a woman over here, believe it or not.`
` No way I was always gonna be stronger than a man!"`
`"We~ll, that's certainly true!`
` The meat I put on my arms all went to your chest, after a~ll.`
` It looks like it'd be a pretty even test of strength between my arms and your boobs, don't you thi~nk?!"`
`"I told you, my boobs aren't for you to feel up!!`
` Besides, how 'bout you—your height says you're an adult, but what about your other places, huh?!"`
`"Stop it, idiot, nooo, I'll be ruuuuined for marriage, don't touch me in strange placeees!!"`
`"D‐don't say stuff people are gonna misinterpret!!"`
`Honestly, I was so surprised at how feminine Jessica had become that I had to seriously horse around to hide it.`
`......Well yeah, considering what a bossy brat she was six years ago, anyone would be surprised.`
`And I guess she's just as surprised.`
`{n}She definitely wasn't expecting she'd lose to me in a test of strength.`
`After losing that easily, she must be shocked at how much I've grown in the past six years.`
`.........Six years.`
` Once again, I'm being shown just what a huge gap of time that was.`
`"Crap...total defeat.`
` It's like I'm no match for you anymore."`
`"That's not true.`
` Even Battler‐kun must have his weaknesses.`
` Right, Maria‐chan?"`
`"Uu!`
` Gonna faaall gonna faaall!!"`
`"Ghhk—Don't—Maria~, let's keep that a secret, okay?"`
`"Faaall?`
` What the hell's that?"`
`"Heheh!`
` Sorry, but you won't be seeing that weakness of mine now!`
` After all, the nightmare plane trip is already over and done with!`
` Only thing left is the nice, quiet splashing of the boat trip.`
` I never thought I'd become so fond of that piece‐a‐junk boat.`
` Ihihihi!"`
`"Huh???`
` George nii‐san, is there something wrong with his head?"`
`"You'll understand soon.`
` Very soon."`
`At the time, I didn't understand what Aniki meant by that big smile...`
`"What have we here......oooh!`
` Battler‐san, how big you've grown...!"`
`Who's it this time?`
` It's an old lady with an apron.`
`{n}.........Oh, oh yeah, that takes me back...I remember now!`
`"Remember her, Battler‐kun?`
` You remember—she's Kumasawa‐san, one of the servants."`
`"I could never forget Kumasawa baa‐chan!`
` I mean, you haven't aged a bit in these past six years.`
` Wait, you haven't gotten younger, have you~?"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho!`
` Lately, my skin has been getting all smooth and silky!`
` And look, hasn't my chest gotten even bigger as well?`
` ...Want to give it a rub?"`
`"V‐very funny!`
` My breast rubbing is strictly limited to bouncy girls!"`
`"Even I had some bouncy ones in my youth, you know~?`
` Now, now, please feel free to have a go!"`
`"Gyah, gimme a break!`
` It's chicks I'm looking for, dammit!`
` Not grannies!"`
`The jokes I'd cracked about Jessica were being used against me.`
` Come to think of it, she always was the type to tease people!`
`"Kumasawa‐san, stop that now.`
` People with one foot in the coffin shouldn't jump around."`
`"To sport with the young is the best rejuvenation medicine.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐ho!"`
`"It's rare for you to come pick us up, Kumasawa‐san.`
` What curious turn of events is this?`
` Normally whenever you're entrusted with something to do, your lumbago always kicks in.`
` *snicker*."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, Eva‐sama, you are harsh as usual.`
` I found myself with some urgent purchases to make, and while I was at it, I thought I would come welcome you all.`
` Although, it does give a bad impression if the one waiting to greet you is a decrepit old woman.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐ho...!"`
`Auntie Eva spoke sarcastically, but Kumasawa baa‐chan's years of experience were nothing to sneeze at.`
` She was more than capable of smoothly and coolly letting that comment slide.`
`Well, I'd rather not say it, but old Kumasawa baa‐chan may be past her prime as a servant.`
`She might act as though she's in good health, but between her headaches and the lumbago, her body is wearing out.`
` To tell the truth, the very fact that she's still working is impressive.`
`...How old is she this year again?`
`{n}She must be pushing eighty by now.`
`{n}It's incredible that she's still able to act so brightly.`
`"You just seem to get more and more lively.`
` Oh, that's right, here you are.`
` It's the tea I was talking about before.`
` Look, I bought some.`
` Please do try it later on."`
`Auntie Rosa showed her the souvenir bag she'd taken out of her suitcase.`
`To think that she had remembered the promise that she had apparently made last year and faithfully bought it.`
` ...This sort of thoughtfulness was just like Auntie Rosa.`
`She wasn't the kind of person who would forget or break a promise.`
`As for Kumasawa baa‐chan, she seemed deeply touched by the fact that not only had Auntie Rosa remembered that year‐old promise, she had brought that gift for a simple servant like her.`
`This woman is Kumasawa Chiyo‐san ({p:0:熊沢 チヨ}).`
`She's a senior servant who's been working for the Ushiromiya head house for many years.`
`{n}As you could expect from someone her age, she isn't that good at manual labor, but from kitchen work to cleaning and laundry, she's a kind of super servant who can handle just about anything.`
`It seems like her only flaw is a tendency to slack off.`
`I hear she tries to get away from heavy or troublesome work by playing up her chronic diseases.`
`......In Kumasawa baa‐chan's case, maybe we should call that a sort of lazy craftiness.`
`...Though it probably doesn't impress those paying her salary.`
`Ah well, even if she's pretty flaky when it comes to work, I could never dislike her.`
`I guess that's probably because of her cheerfulness and her constant smile.`
`"Hey, glad to see you're still in fine spirits!`
` How's your back doin' then?"`
`"Even with the medicine, it's not getting one whit better.`
` According to the doctor, nothing can be done for this one.`
` It's what's called an incurable disease, hoh‐hoh‐ho!"`
`"Blows me away how you've just kept getting prettier, Jessica‐chan.`
` Be glad you ended up like Natsuhi nee‐san."`
`"R‐really...?`
` Personally, I don't think I look like her at all...`
` I mean, I don't even want to be like my parents.`
` 'Cause I got zero respect for 'em."`
`"Now, you shouldn't say such things.`
` *giggle*, it's amazing how many people don't want to be like their parents in our family."`
`"Ah, that's me!"`
`"Hell no, don't you dare start taking after me.`
` Your nose looking like mine already pisses me off."`
`"What are you talking about?`
` It's ridiculous how completely alike you are—and like your father."`
`"Come on, you can't be serious...`
` Just how am I like Dad?"`
`"You're his copy in arrogance and self‐importance.`
` Father's blood is especially strong in you and Nii‐san.`
` Wouldn't you say, Rosa?"`
`"Oh, absolutely.`
` Krauss nii‐san and Rudolf nii‐san are almost unbelievably like Dad."`
`"Alright, alright already, why am I the only one under fire from the girls?`
` Hideyoshi nii‐san, please help me out."`
`"My my, Rudolf‐kun, you're always so popular with the ladies.`
` I'm jealous!`
` Wahahahaha!"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho!`
` As usual, you're popular enough to make me jealous.`
` Well then, everyone, shall we head over to the boat?`
` Come now, Maria‐san, let's get on the boat together, alright?"`
`"Get on the boat together.`
` Uu!`
` Everyone gets on together.`
` Uu!"`
`"Hell yeah, this time around I'm not gonna be scared.`
` I'm used to being shaken by the waves.`
` With that piece‐a‐junk fishing boat, I'm less afraid of the shaking than the engine breaking down and the boat drifting off."`
`"Oh yes, Battler‐kun, I forgot to tell you.`
` ...That fishing boat was completely decrepit, so it was taken out of use a few years back.`
` Now we get taken to the island in another boat."`
`"Ohhh, right.`
` It's Battler's first time in the new boat!`
` It's super comfy!`
` And frickin' fast!`
` It can go at crazy high speeds!"`
`"Ohhh...`
` That means less trip time, right?`
` That sounds great!`
` I mean, a boat might be better than an airplane, but if you're telling me we can spend even a little less time exposed to the danger of sinking, that's really just awesomely great~."`
`"...Uu.`
` Is Battler gonna faaall gonna faaall again?"`
`"That's only on airplanes.`
` Everything's fine now!"`
`"You know, it's apparently a modded high‐speed boat, the captain's pride and joy!`
` Seems he's tinkered with it quite a lot—`
`he was going on about how he attached four high efficiency propellers to it, and now it can break 40 knots, or something like that.`
` He bragged to me so much I ended up memorizing it."`
`"Me too; I remember since we're told about it every year.`
` The captain said that since he lost a speed contest with a foreign fishing boat a long time ago, he became obsessed with modding.`
` He told us how his opponent back then could go at over 30 knots, even though it was only in a fishing boat."`
`"To fulfill his thirst for a revenge match, he created an awesome whole new super high‐speed modded boat.`
` I'm sure you'll just love it, Battler."`
`...S‐super high‐speed modded boat...?`
`......My first thought was that this would be much better than some beat‐up boat that might sink at any time......`
`but for some reason, I'm getting this feeling of foreboding...`
` ......Nah.`
`"Hey, Battler, maybe you should just swim to the island."`
`"Battler‐kun, you shouldn't lean over the railing too much.`
` You might fall."`
`"Uu‐uu!!`
` Gonna faaall gonna faaall!!"`
`"Daaaaammiiiiit...so this is why you were all grinning before!"`
`The super high‐speed boat, said to have been modded to hell and back by its captain as a personal hobby, was definitely nothing like the battered old fishing boat from six years ago.`
`"Whooooooooa, it's shaking it's shaking it's shaking!!`
` I'm gonna fall gonna fall gonna fall!!"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Gonna fall gonna fall gonna fall!!"`
`"If I fall I'll be in the sea, I'll drown goddammit—where's the parachute—no, wait—where's the buoy?!`
` Gimme a life jackeeeet!!"`
`"Waah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!`
` What the hell, Battler, what's that supposed to be...waah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!"`
`"Jessica‐chan, Maria‐chan, it's not nice to tease.`
` Battler‐kun, if you're scared, then just don't come out on the deck.`
` I think that if you stay inside the boat, you'll be a bit less afraid."`
`"Heheh, that's a no‐thank‐you, Aniki!`
` Shipwreck victims are always the ones inside the boat.`
` The survivors are usually those on the deck during the accident.`
` So I'm staying right here!!"`
`"But, it's shakiiiiing!!`
` I'm falliiing!!`
` Whooooaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"Shaking falliing!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Maria, I told you to behave yourself!`
` ......But Battler‐kun, it looks like you really can't handle it...`
` I'll go tell the captain to slow down for you."`
`"Whooooa, Auntie Rosa, thank yooooouuuuu!`
` Even on the sea, exercise safe driving, reduce speeds, point and caaaall!!"`
`"*cackle*!`
` Don't do that, Rosa.`
` Ordeals are necessary for the young.`
` Right, Battler‐kun?`
` You can conquer this much, no problem at all, right?`
` Otherwise, you won't be able to go to Egypt with your aunt!"`
`"Whooooa, Auntie Eva, you're meeeeeeeeaaaan!`
` Ooh noooo, I'm gonna faaaaaall!!`
` Life jackeeeet, parachuuuute!!`
` Whoooooooaaaaaaahh......!!!"`
`"N‐no, okay, turn it over and think that way!!`
` What's the enemy aiming for?!`
` He wants to make me afraid like this?!`
` If that's what he's aiming for, too bad, like hell I'll be scaaaaaaaared!!`
` But stooopp iiit, I'm gonna faaaaaaall!!!"`
`...So, after I made a huge fool of myself for a while,`
` Auntie Rosa had a talk with the boat captain, and he slowed down to a more manageable speed for me...`
`"............Hahh...`
` This speed is a bit better...`
` .........Earlier, I didn't even feel alive......"`
`The new speed, which I was capable of tolerating, was apparently extremely slow.`
`...But that just now was completely insane...`
`The whole boat was shaking!`
`{n}Sliding and leaping on the ocean's surface!`
`{n}It felt like I was riding on the back of a flying fish...`
`Jessica was still guffawing at me as I leaned against the railing, tired and disheartened.`
`"I lost in that strength contest earlier, but I'm glad to know I've got the edge where it really counts.`
` But seriously, pfffahahahahah!"`
`"Dammit...go ahead and laugh.`
` One of these days, I'm gonna find your weakness and I'll get back at you...and then your boobs will be mine to squish......"`
`"Ahahaha, well, we'll see about that if you ever do find it, okay?!`
` Waah‐hah‐hah‐ha!"`
`"Uu.`
` Battler, all worn out."`
`"Yeah, Battler, all worn out...`
` I want to die on land, not in the ocean or the sky..."`
`Maria was patting my back, so I patted her head in return.`
`...Her expression was blank, as usual, but I realized that she wanted to console me.`
`"Battler‐kun, the captain is throwing in drinks to make up for this.`
` Have a drink and take a break, why don't you?`
` To calm yourself down."`
`George‐aniki and Kumasawa baa‐chan brought us each an ice‐cold drink with drops of moisture on the can.`
`Judging from Kumasawa‐san's big grin, our parents inside the boat were probably all rolling around laughing at my moment of pure terror.`
`Dammit, I'm so embarrassed that I can't bear to face any of them...`
`If I didn't change the subject somehow, I had the feeling I'd be the butt of everyone's jokes for the whole trip, so I tried to think of something harmless to talk about.`
`"...Hey, Jessica.`
` How are Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi doing?"`
`"My old man and my mom?`
` Unfortunately, they're fine.`
` Though every other word out of their mouths is "study, study", which pisses me off.`
` I'm so jealous, 'cause it doesn't look like Uncle Hideyoshi or Uncle Rudolf say those kinds of things."`
`"Hahaha, oh no.`
` When I was slacking off during exams, I was always getting told "exams, exams".`
` I thought it was annoying, but now I'm grateful."`
`"Hah, I knew it, George‐aniki is magnanimous as ever...`
` As for me, I have to look after myself.`
` No one says a thing to me!`
` Well, it's not like I'd listen if they did, hihihi!"`
`"Battler‐san, have you still not returned to your birth home?"`
`"...Well, I kinda go back now and then.`
` I still have lots of clothes and stuff left at the previous house."`
`"......Uu?`
` Battler has two homes?"`
`"Uh,`
` .........hmmm.`
` ......Something like that."`
`"Why?`
` Why do you have two homes?`
` Uu?`
` Uu?"`
`Only Maria, who couldn't really grasp the situation, voiced her naive question.`
`However, the others just shot nervous glances at me, choosing not to respond even though they knew the answer.`
`"Maria!`
` Look, you can see the harbor now...!`
` Look, over there!`
` Can you see it?!"`
`"Uu!`
` Saw the harbor, saw the harbor!"`
`Apparently, Jessica was trying to be nice by changing the subject.`
`......Ah, well.`
` I'd rather not talk about it if I can help it, but it's uncomfortable to have it treated like some kind of weird taboo.`
`......I don't mind that much myself anymore.`
`I am an Ushiromiya,`
` but the truth is that, for the past six years, I've been living with my grandparents on my late mother's side, and I've even been using her family name.`
`When those grandparents passed away one after the other, I'd basically had no choice except to go back and live with the old bastard.`
`Don't get me wrong. I didn't just run away from home or anything like that.`
`{n}The only one at fault here is my dad.`
`......I don't really blame Kyrie‐san.`
`{n}Being able to hold that old bastard's reins and ride him out is no mean feat.`
`...But as for the betrayal that the old bastard inflicted on my mom...`
` ......Well, unfortunately, I still haven't fully gotten over that.`
`"*ahem*.`
` We'll be getting there soon."`
`George‐aniki cleared his throat, trying to change the topic.`
`"......Please forgive my indiscretion.`
` It seems this old woman has said too much already.`
` If I have hurt your feelings—"`
`"Heheh!`
` I don't mind it and no one's feelings are hurt.`
` Don't worry, Kumasawa baa‐chan."`
`Kumasawa‐san seemed to regret speaking out of turn,`
` but I was more concerned about being worried over for something like that, so I stood up and passed it off lightly.`
`After that, I had a sip of my drink and headed over to Maria and Jessica, who were gazing at the silhouette of the island.`
`"Uu!`
` Battler, saw the island, saw the island!`
` There there there!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!"`
`"Where is it...oh, I see it now.`
` Even after six years, the island hasn't changed a bit."`
`The small island's silhouette in front of us had gotten pretty close.`
`This island's name is Rokkenjima.`
`{n}It's a small island about ten kilometers around, located in the Izu Archipelago.`
`Since they call this archipelago "the Izu Seven", lots of people think there are seven islands, but that's not true.`
`There are actually more than seven.`
`{n}Rokkenjima is one of the minor islands that don't get counted.`
`Even considering that, there are probably very few people who know about this island.`
`After all, only the people of the Ushiromiya family come to this island.`
`In other words, it has no ties whatsoever to outsiders or tourists.`
`{n}So, you'll never find this island's name in a travel brochure.`
`This is because all of Rokkenjima is an estate possessed by the Ushiromiya head house.`
`Only the Ushiromiya family lives there, and only people connected to the Ushiromiya family come and go there.`
`There's nothing there except a harbor and a mansion.`
`{n}The vast majority of the island is still just uncultivated forest.`
`Such a waste, when it could be made into a nice golf course.`
`{n}However, when you realize that the entire coastline is a private beach, it starts to sound pretty magnificent.`
`You might have realized it by now, but to put it simply,`
` ......well, the Ushiromiya family is just rolling in dough.`
`The fortune possessed by the head house is apparently vast,`
` and Dad and the others who make up the branch families have built up plenty of wealth for themselves, finding success in their respective businesses.`
`I've been living a commoner's life at my grandparents' home these six years, so I'd completely forgotten,`
` ...but the old bastard's house really is elegant, and everything about it is tuned to match the snobbish tastes of the annoyingly rich.`
`Come to think of it, I guess that means George‐aniki, Jessica, Maria, and I are all wealthy, high‐class gentlemen and ladies.`
`Needless to say, none of us feel that way at all.`
`I don't see myself as being rich, and George‐aniki, who takes self‐discipline very seriously, doesn't let himself get too comfortable.`
`Jessica is always complaining that she'd rather move to the city than be rich,`
` and Maria is still a kid who isn't even interested in money at all.`
`...I guess that attitude itself is snobbish.`
`{n}From the perspective of people in poverty who can't pay the bills, we're very lucky to even have the luxury of thinking this way.`
`This isn't the place to explain any further, so I won't.`
`Anyway, it's the same as not being able to choose the parents you're born from.`
`{n}I didn't ask to be born into a rich family.`
`{n}And I don't think it's something I should be hated for.`
`It can be pretty trying when people are prejudiced against you just because you're rich and refuse to judge you by your merits...`
`As I pondered these sentimental thoughts, Maria leaned over the railing and started shouting.`
`"............Uu.`
` ......Gone."`
`"What's wrong, Maria?`
` Did you drop something?"`
`"Uu‐uu!`
` Gone, gone!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`Maria kept yelling "gone, gone".`
`From her words alone, you would think she had perhaps dropped something, but she was actually pointing out over the ocean as she shouted.`
`"What's wrong?`
` What's gone?`
` I'll look for it too, if you want.`
` What is it?`
` ...............?"`
`If she'd dropped something, she would probably have looked down at the floor, but Maria was pointing out over the ocean.`
`One would assume that she had seen something out over the ocean, but she kept saying that something was {i:gone}.`
` .........Strange.`
`However, since my last memories of this place came from six years ago, I was able to spot it before Aniki, who comes here every year.`
`"............Huh...?`
` ......If I remember correctly, wasn't there a {c:86EF9C:torii} or something on top of a small crag around here?`
` ...That's right, it was definitely there.`
` I remember it well, since it's like a landmark, the first thing to greet you as you get closer to the island."`
`"Wow, you're amazing, Battler.`
` Even though it's been six years, you remembered."`
`"It was here, wasn't it...!`
` I remember too.`
` There used to be a shrine and a torii‐like thing standing all alone on that crag.`
` ......And now that you mention it, they are gone, aren't they.`
` They definitely were there last year, I think."`
`"Gone.`
` Gone.`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!"`
`"Maybe they were washed away by the waves or something?`
` It was a small crag, it probably got brittle because of its exposure."`
`"I think so too.`
` It actually disappeared during the summer.`
` Apparently—"`
`"A huge lightning bolt fell one evening and smashed the shrine, or some such...`
` ......The fishermen whisper that it must undoubtedly be an ominous sign, to have a thunderbolt fall upon our tutelary god.`
` ...Lightning begone, lightning begone..."`
`Kumasawa‐san smiled impishly as if teasing us, rubbing her hands together.`
`However, Maria was apparently taking it seriously,`
` and she stared fixedly over the ocean to where the crag enshrining the local guardian deity was supposed to be.`
`"............An ominous...sign.`
` ............Uu."`
`"Enough, Kumasawa‐san.`
` Maria isn't old enough to understand this kind of joke."`
`"It's alright, Maria‐chan.`
` It's just a coincidence.`
` Nothing scary's gonna happen."`
`George‐aniki put a hand on Maria's shoulder to calm her down, but Maria's sharp‐eyed expression didn't budge.`
`"............Ominous.`
` ............Ominous."`
`Maria muttered that word over and over.`
`{n}Apparently, repeating a single word over and over is a habit that Maria's had for a long time.`
`However, since the word she was saying was quite literally ominous, it was a bit creepy.`
`"Hey now, Maria.`
` Some disaster really will come if you say that word over and over, you know?"`
`I tapped Maria's other shoulder.`
`And then, Maria whipped her head around, stared into my face, and spoke unblinkingly.`
`"Uu.`
` .........Disaster...coming."`
`"Huh?`
` And just where is it coming from?"`
`I answered light‐heartedly, trying to break the tension in the air.`
`...And in reply, Maria held up a finger, raised her arm high, ...and pointed up to the heavens.`
`When I looked up, I saw that the sky was still just as cloudy, but it had grown a great deal more leaden than it had been that morning.`
`That's right—they were saying that a typhoon was approaching.`
`...We had planned to spend one night on the island, but if this storm doesn't pass quickly, I won't be able to make it to school on Monday.`
`{n}Well, I guess it makes for a pretty good excuse to be absent.`
`".....................Uu..."`
`...She apparently sensed something ominous in this cloudy sky.`
`{n}She's been muttering for a while now.`
`Girls at Maria's age tend to be very impressionable.`
`{n}She's just about the age when many girls start to get excited about sixth senses and whether they have any psychic potential and stuff.`
`...In a way, being sensitive about things like this isn't really out of the ordinary for a kid like her.`
`"It's alright, Maria‐chan.`
` The weather might get worse around tonight, but tomorrow it'll clear up and become a pretty blue sky."`
`"Uu.`
` Pretty blue sky.........`
` .........Uu..."`
`"That's right, by tomorrow it'll be a pretty blue sky.`
` There's no rain that doesn't end, and no clouds that never clear."`
`"Uu...`
` .........Rain that doesn't end.`
` ...Clouds that never clear.`
` ..................Uu........."`
`"Sure, the typhoon's coming, but it'll be gone before you know it!`
` It's alright, Maria."`
`"...............Uu.`
` ...Uu!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`Maria started yelling "uu‐uu".`
`{n}...It looked as though she was having a tantrum because no one could understand what she was trying to say.`
`What in the world is Maria trying so desperately to warn us about?`
`Unable to understand her, we could do nothing but feel a vague sense of foreboding...`
`......I've heard that everyone can feel the supernatural, but that it weakens as you age.`
`That might mean that Maria, the youngest one of us all, still possessed some kind of sense that the rest of us had lost.`
`...I wonder if that sense is sending her a warning.`
`At that moment, Kumasawa‐san quietly opened her mouth.`
`".........Rumor has it...`
`that long ago, Rokkenjima was—"`
`"Kumasawa‐san.`
` Let's not talk about that now."`
`Just as Kumasawa‐san was about to tell some kind of story, Jessica sharply interrupted her.`
`For Jessica, this was an extremely firm reaction.`
`I wanted to push her further, just out of simple curiosity,`
` but judging by how Jessica was acting, it wasn't difficult to imagine that it would simply inflame Maria's unease further.`
`...If I did try to press her for the story, the odds were pretty good that it wouldn't be anything bright and cheery.`
`"......Hoh‐hoh‐ho, I do apologize about that...`
` ...The wind here is hard to bear for the elderly, so if you would excuse me for now..."`
`Gossipers have no reason to hang around after they've been told to stop chatting.`
`When Kumasawa‐san finally realized that she'd overstepped her bounds, she went back inside the boat.`
`After she left, Uncle Hideyoshi came along to replace her.`
`Since he'd shown up partway through, he completely failed to notice the complicated atmosphere that hung about the scene,`
` so he refreshingly and unwittingly swept that atmosphere aside.`
`So, in the end, it was his unwittingness that brightened the mood.`
`"Looks like we're almost there!`
` Alright, just a little more!`
` Took forever at the speed we went today, didn't it?`
` You all know whose fault that is!`
` Wahhahahahaha!"`
`"Aww, Uncle Hideyoshi, gimme a break already~...hahaha~!"`
`"Ahaha, keep on twisting the knife.`
` Seriously, 'cause of Battler, it's takin' fore~ver!"`
`".........Uu."`
`Maria had probably come to the conclusion that no one was going to listen to her.`
`She hung her head, wearing a fretful face.`
`As she did, George‐aniki crouched down to meet her eyes and spoke to her kindly.`
`"Maria‐chan.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of.`
` Because we're all together.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of if we're together.`
` Go ahead and say it."`
`"............Uu.`
` ...There's nothing to be afraid of...if we're together..."`
`"Yes.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of if we're together."`
`"............Uu."`
`"Yeah, George‐aniki knows what he's talking about.`
` If we're all together, there'll absolutely never be anything at all to be scared of.`
` Right, Jessica?"`
`"Yeah, no doubt about that.`
` George nii‐san always tells the truth, Maria."`
`"......Uu.`
` George onii‐chan always true."`
`"Yes.`
` I don't lie.`
` So trust me.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of if we're all together."`
`"Uu.`
` ......George onii‐chan doesn't lie.`
` I trust you.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of if we're all together.`
` .........Uu, not afraid!"`
`Maria jumped into George‐aniki's arms and hugged him tightly.`
`After Aniki patted her head, she jumped away again.`
`Her facial expression had returned so completely to normal that she looked like a totally different person from moments before.`
`{n}She was once again the ordinary Maria.`
`"Uu.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of anymore, because we're all together.`
` ...Uu‐uu."`
`"Yeah, that's it.`
` ...You look all better now.`
` You're strong, Maria, good girl!"`
`"......Uu!`
` {c:86EF9C:I'm} a good girl!"`
`"Hey now, what's goin' on here?`
` Maria‐chan didn't get seasick, did she?`
` Hm?"`
`"Hahaha, well, something like that.`
` We'll be arriving soon."`
`The harbor was already drawing near.`
`The boat gave a big shudder.`
`Seems we've docked at the harbor.`
`{n}The boat driver came out and jumped to the pier with the mooring rope.`
`A large man in a tuxedo was waiting there for us with a warm, smiling face.`
`......I didn't know him, but judging by his clothes, I guessed that he was a servant of the Ushiromiya head house.`
`"Welcome home, Milady.`
` You were quite late, and I began to worry."`
`"Ah, thanks for caring!`
` The boat had Battler scared shitless.`
` So we had to slow down for him.`
` Seriously, what a pain in the ass!"`
`"S‐shut up... I'll remember this when the shoe's on the other foot someday... ugghh."`
`At this rate, the word'll spread around the entire family, and I'll become the big conversation piece during dinner.`
`Even without this, everyone'd be talking about me because of that six‐year gap...but now I've provided them with an even juicier topic...!`
`Dammit, why does the Ushiromiya main family have to live on this isolated island!`
`In the meantime, the boat had finished its mooring.`
`{n}A small plank was lowered so that we could get down.`
`One by one, our parents came out of the boat.`
`"You must all be quite tired from your long trip.`
` Madam, please, allow me to assist you."`
`"Thanks.`
` It's been a while, Gohda‐san, how are you?"`
`"Thank you for your concern.`
` It is always my pleasure to serve."`
`"Battler‐kun, isn't this your first time meeting Gohda‐san?`
` If I'm not mistaken, you weren't working here six years ago, right?"`
`"Indeed.`
` So please, allow me to greet him for the first time.`
` It is an honor to meet you at last, Battler‐sama."`
`"......I'm pretty secure about my height, but you're huge.`
` ...This is definitely our first meeting.`
` If I'd ever met a big guy like you, I'd never forget it...!"`
`"It's a pleasure.`
` I'm Battler."`
`"Your return has been keenly anticipated, sir.`
` I have been working for the Ushiromiya head house since the year before last; my name is Gohda ({p:0:郷田}), your servant."`
`"It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.`
` If there is ever anything you need, please feel free to rely on me."`
`"Gohda‐san, it's been some time."`
`"It has been too long, George‐sama.`
` Please, allow me to assist you."`
`"As usual, you're a reception pro...`
` If you ever need a job, just give me a holler, okay?`
` I'd hire you just like that!"`
`"You do me too much honor.`
` Please allow me to assist you, Hideyoshi‐sama."`
`Gohda‐san then lent a hand to everyone as they disembarked, greeting them as they passed.`
`His speech and mannerisms had the refined polish of a professional.`
`He was very graceful, in contrast with his initially rough‐looking appearance.`
`His large size made him seem a bit scary at first, but he was much more polite than my first impression of him had led me to believe.`
`He claimed to have served on the island for two years, but he had doubtless worked at a similar job somewhere before.`
`After everybody disembarked, the mooring rope was untied, and the boat started to steer away from the harbor.`
`It was probably returning to its home port of Niijima.`
`The captain waved his hand in farewell.`
`{n}Maria conscientiously waved back.`
`"............Hmmm, I just realized why something's been feeling out of place to me.`
` I can't hear the cries of the seagulls."`
`"Seagulls?`
` The birds?"`
`I remember that whenever we came to this island, the seagulls always welcomed us with their lively "nyaa nyaa" cries.`
`And because of that, whenever I hear the cries of the seagulls in any other place, I get the feeling that I've come to a family conference.`
`Except for the small part of the island where those of the Ushiromiya head house live, Rokkenjima had been left uncultivated, apparently transforming into a paradise for wild birds.`
`Seemingly, some cliff face or other had become home to a huge seagull colony, and so this island was always full of them.`
`Since those seagulls didn't come to greet us, I felt a bit lonely.`
`"What's wrong, Battler‐kun?"`
`"Oh, Auntie Rosa.`
` ...Nah, it's nothing really—I was just saying I can't hear the seagulls, so it kinda feels a bit lonely."`
`"Oh, you're right.`
` They're always so lively, but I can't see hide nor hair of one today."`
`"......Uu?`
` Why no seagulls?"`
`"Hmmm, maybe it's because the seagulls are having a gathering somewhere too?`
` Maria, did you want to see the seagulls?"`
`"Uu, wanted to."`
`"What happened for them all to disappear?`
` Maybe Jessica made aaall of 'em into shish kebabs and ate 'em!"`
`"......Uu?!"`
`"The hell, don't say disturbing stuff like that!`
` You'll get Maria all confused!!"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!`
` Jessica onee‐chan made them into shish kebabs, made them into shish kebabs!`
` Uu!!"`
`"I did not, I did not!`
` Why the hell would I do something like that?!"`
`"That's right, that's ri~ght, Jessica made 'em into shish kebabs!`
` Skin 'n meatballs, liver 'n onio~on!"`
`"Swim in meat dolls!`
` Liver 'n oniooon!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!`
` Ahaha, ahaha!`
` *giggle*giggle*!"`
`As I made fun of Jessica, Maria tagged along looking like she was having fun.`
`Ooh, she really knows how to join in with things!`
`{n}Alright then, starting today I'll make you my number one follower!`
`As I smiled at her, she beamed back overjoyed, I guess happy for this little bit of solidarity.`
`"That's not it, Maria‐chan.`
` I've heard that wild birds are attuned to changes in the weather and atmospheric pressure.`
` And it looks like the weather will get worse around tonight.`
` It's possible they hurried back to their nests."`
`"............Uu.`
` Not kebabs?`
` Jessica onee‐chan didn't make them into kebabs?"`
`"I did not, I did not!!`
` I told you, I wouldn't do stuff like that!`
` Alright, Battler, you admit right now that you lied!"`
`"Battler‐kun.`
` Maria‐chan is a naive girl, so she takes even jokes seriously.`
` You should choose your jokes more carefully."`
`...George‐aniki gently scolded me.`
`...Even though I outstripped Aniki in height, he still commanded respect as my elder.`
` No choice but to obediently apologize.`
`"H‐hey,`
` my bad, my bad...`
` Maria, that just now was a joke.`
` It's just today the seagulls are all quiet in their nests."`
`"......Battler lie?`
` George onii‐chan true?"`
`{i:I was having fun, but you were actually just tricking me...?}`
`{n}Her pure eyes seemed to accuse me.`
`{n}......Maybe I went a little overboard with her after all.`
`"Yeeaah, that's right, that's right.`
` What George‐aniki said is true.`
` The weather is bad so they probably went home for today.`
` It doesn't mean they're gone, does it?`
` Right, Auntie?!"`
`"That's right.`
` Tomorrow, when the weather gets better, I'm sure they'll come back and let you hear their "myaa myaa" cries."`
`"Uu.`
` I'll wait for the weather to get better so they come back.`
` Wait for tomorrow.`
` Wait for the weather to get better.`
` Uu‐uu!"`
`Maria's mood lightened, and she started looking forward to tomorrow, when the seagulls would come back and fill the skies.`
`Still, George‐aniki really is amazing at taking care of kids.`
`...I think I remember Aniki taking good care of me as well when I was a brat six years ago.`
`......Aniki might have quite some talent for this kind of thing.`
`"George‐kun, you're so amazing at taking care of kids.`
` I think you could work in child‐care!"`
`"Yeah, it's like you were born to do that.`
` To me, that seems more "you" than doing business in some company president office."`
`"Oh, no.`
` Child‐care is a very respectable {i:job} of its own.`
` It's not something you can do merely by liking children."`
`"You're truly modest, George‐kun.`
` But Battler‐kun, you're quite good with children too, you know!`
` Earlier, even if it was just for a time, Maria seemed to be having a lot of fun.`
` Keep on playing with her like you did just now.`
` Just choose the jokes carefully though, alright?`
` *giggle*."`
`Auntie Rosa winked at me, giggling a little.`
`A real mother, I thought to myself, who's happy that Maria looks like she's having fun.`
`"Come {i:on}, Rosa.`
` And you brats too, what the hell're you doing, get a move on!"`
`"Alright, alright, we're coming."`
`The old bastard was beckoning us to hurry up.`
`{n}We'd better get moving.`
`It's not like it'd be too late to have the same discussion after we got our luggage in our rooms.`
`"Well then, everyone, I shall lead you towards the guesthouse where you will be staying.`
` Please, this way."`
`Gohda‐san called to everyone and started leading us.`
`{n}Kumasawa‐san brought up the rear.`
`A serpentine, twisting path led through a dim forest.`
`{n}It ran a bit uphill.`
`I'd guess the path was made twisting so that the slope wouldn't be felt too much,`
` but personally, I'd have been happier if they'd been man enough to make some stairs in a straight line.`
`......No doubt they made the path twisting on purpose, to put on airs of distance and importance...`
`Before long, we saw garden‐style stone steps.`
`...Ahhh, now, I remember how it goes from here.`
`{n}Go up these, and...`
`At the top of the stone steps, a beautiful guesthouse came into view.`
`Its façade was lovely, of course, but even more than that,`
` ......we couldn't help but have our hearts stolen away by the splendor of that beautiful rose garden that spread before it.`
`"Haah~!`
` It's as beautiful as ever this year...`
` A real delight for the eyes..."`
`As they reached the top of the stone steps, the people welcomed in by the rose garden voiced their appreciation one after another.`
`"Aren't the flowers less lively this year?`
` It must be because the summer wasn't warm enough."`
`"I also believe that is so.`
` When one compares with last year's blooming, it is a pity that this year's is somewhat inferior."`
`Even so, it was a delightful rose garden.`
`{n}I remember that huge amounts of roses used to greet me every year, even over six years ago.`
`...This rose garden was the first thing that greeted the people who came to Rokkenjima.`
` Even our parents, who came every year, couldn't help but let their wonder slip out.`
`And moreover, it even looked like a "powered‐up" version of the garden from six years ago that was in my memories.`
`"This place is always so amazing.`
` It would be so wonderful to have a rose garden like this in my own home."`
`"Give it up—who do you think would take care of it?`
` Roses are a real pain, with bugs and diseases to worry about."`
`"Yes, they are.`
` In fact, I hear that Kyrie nee‐san attends to her "rose" every day, and makes sure that it doesn't get nibbled at without her knowing it."`
`"Huh?`
` I haven't heard anything like that, what's this?"`
`"Yes, I do.`
` Though, with him, it's the rose that goes off after the insects, so it's really more like some nasty carnivorous plant."`
`"...Oh, so that's what you mean.`
` C'mon, Rosa, can't you give that a rest just for today?`
` I've put that sort of thing completely behind me."`
`"I wonder.`
` After all, you are a womanizer on an almost genetic level...!"`
`"No need to worry, Rosa‐san.`
` If a rose gives me too much trouble, I just chop it off at the root."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho...such frightening talk this is."`
`"Guys who're popular with the ladies are always forced to live with danger at their side.`
` I sure hope I turn out a bit prettier in my next life!"`
`"Hideyoshi nii‐san, as I keep telling you, it isn't like that at all.`
` ...And Kyrie...stop it, you're freaking me out.`
` You're making my rose wither."`
`"Hey, Maria‐chan, look over here.`
` These roses are especially magnificent."`
`"...Roses are magnificent.`
` ...Uu!"`
`"Hmmm~~, smells pretty sweet.`
` Look, this matches my elegance pe~rfectly."`
`"Hey, cut it out!`
` Maria's gonna imitate you and get hurt by the thorns!"`
`She yelled at me as I leaned in with an exaggerated gesture to smell the rose's scent.`
`...I thought she was overreacting, but when I turned around, I saw Maria imitating my every movement, and thereby putting a broad smile on George‐aniki's face.`
`"Hey now, Maria‐chan, be careful.`
` Rose thorns can hurt."`
`"......Uu?`
` ............George onii‐chan.`
` This one rose is strange.`
` Uu."`
`"Strange?`
` What's wrong?"`
`Maria pointed to a single rose.`
`{n}I immediately understood why she found it odd.`
`In the midst of all these magnificent roses, just one single rose was withering.`
`There wasn't any particular reason.`
`{n}Some roses flourish, and others wither.`
`That's all there was to it, but Maria seemed very concerned about there being only one unhealthy rose in a group of healthy ones.`
`...She must be feeling somehow like it's been left out.`
`"So, you feel sad for this rose because it's the only one that isn't healthy...?"`
`"......Uu.`
` The others are all healthy, but this one's sad."`
`"Well, they all bloom and wither on their own.`
` I'll bet the only reason that one withered now is because it bloomed earlier than any of the other roses."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` It probably just bloomed all over the place, fulfilled its duty and went to rest.`
` You shouldn't get so worked up about it."`
`".........Uu."`
`It seemed that Maria's pure, sensitive nature was making her feel some emotional pain for the rose that withered alone.`
`Even though she understood the logic of it, it still felt lonely to her.`
`"Okay, Maria‐chan,`
` why don't you look after this rose until we leave, then?"`
`"Uu?"`
`George‐aniki straightened up and felt around in his pocket.`
`{n}He then took out the wrapping from the candy he had eaten on the plane.`
`He twisted it into a thin string, and gently tied it to the rose as a sort of marker.`
`"Heeey, that's pretty cute!"`
`"Let's mark it with this.`
` Later on, you can come and give it some water.`
` I'm sure Mr. Rose will be happy."`
`"......Uu!`
` Come to give it water!"`
`"I think you should give Mr. Rose here a name.`
` I'm sure that'll make it happy, and you'll get to know it a little better."`
`"Name...?`
` Name...`
` ......Uu...uu..."`
`Though she still wore her usual sullen face, Maria crossed her arms and began to consider this intently.`
`At the very least, she appeared to have been completely pulled out of her slump.`
` Nice going, Aniki.`
`"George nii‐san has always been really understanding.`
` Can't help but respect him."`
`"Yeah.`
` I guess that's just his gift.`
` We've gotta learn some lessons from him!"`
`"Was this garden as fancy as this when you were a kid?"`
`"It was only after I left the house that it became this grand.`
` Though I was more fond of the previous rustic garden.`
` Nii‐san fiddled with it too much, with his slightly questionable taste.`
` It was much better the way it was before."`
`"Eva, you've gotta think positive!`
` No matter how it might've looked, its beauty now is something to be admired.`
` You'll be able to relax a lot better if you look at it that way."`
`"I didn't mean it like that...`
` I was just saying that I would have liked you to have seen the old, more wonderful garden as well."`
`"Now then, everyone, if you please.`
` I shall be guiding you to the rooms now."`
`Gohda‐san called to everyone to ask if we were ready,`
` but our hearts had been completely stolen away by the rose garden after a year of absence, and we didn't lend him an ear.`
`Since we weren't a travel group, it wasn't like we had a strict schedule to follow.`
`Besides, for our parents, this was their fond old birth home they had returned to, so they felt no obligation to be pressured by anyone.`
`Understanding the situation, Gohda‐san continued to wait, with a wide smile, for our parents to lose interest in the roses and tell him to guide us to the rooms...`
`"My...!`
` Heeey!`
` If it isn't Kanon‐kun!`
` It's been so long, how are you doin'?!"`
`Uncle Hideyoshi suddenly shouted.`
`In the direction he was waving,`
` .........there was a slender boy.`
`Meeting him right after a huge man like Gohda probably emphasized his small stature.`
`The boy was in the middle of transporting piled‐up gardening tools and the like in a wheelbarrow.`
`When he realized he was being called to stop, he set down the wheelbarrow, took his hat off and bowed his head.`
`"..................`
` .........Good afternoon."`
`...I figured he was probably younger than me.`
`{n}I realized by the general atmosphere surrounding him that he was a servant too.`
`Though he did greet Uncle Hideyoshi back, he himself seemed like he might be unsociable.`
`It was a greeting that lacked feeling.`
`When Gohda‐san noticed that our interest had shifted towards him, he went to the boy's side and introduced him to us.`
`"Battler‐sama, I shall introduce you.`
` He is one of the servants who serve the Ushiromiya head house.`
` ...Kanon‐san, greet our guest."`
`"..................I'm pleased to meet you.`
` I am the servant............`
`Kanon ({p:0:嘉音})."`
`Yep, my first impression wasn't wrong—he gave the feeling that he was unsociable, or maybe a bit of a poor speaker.`
`In contrast with Gohda‐san, who was extraordinarily polished as a servant,`
` it was impossible not to feel the immaturity you'd expect of someone his age.`
`When Gohda‐san urged him in a whisper to give a bit more of an introduction, the boy named Kanon only cast his eyes downwards.`
`"Kanon‐san.`
` Could you perhaps give them a little more as a greeting...?"`
`"............I can't.`
` ............Because we...`
`...are furniture."`
`It seemed that he wasn't refusing to greet us out of spite,`
` but rather, he gave the impression that he didn't know what else to add to his greeting, and so could do nothing other than stay silent.`
`"Ah, uh, Kanon‐kun's a man of few words.`
` He might not be that sociable, but deep down he's really a good person!`
` Don't get him wrong...!"`
`"You've been working here for three years, was it?`
` So yeah, you've been here a year longer than Gohda‐san, right, Kanon‐kun?"`
`Even though it's not like he made a super bad impression, Jessica hurriedly backed him up.`
`...I see, apparently him being unsociable works against him all the time.`
`"Cool, nice to meet you.`
` I'm Battler!`
` I'm 18, how old are you?"`
`"..........................."`
`A silence, as if evaluating whether it was a question that must be answered or not.`
`{n}...But here again, Jessica plowed ahead.`
`"Um, uhh...!`
` If I remember correctly, he's two years younger than us so...16, right?"`
`"............Yes, ...that is correct."`
`It looked like if given a choice, he would have preferred not to tell us his age.`
`Him not wanting to tell his age was probably because he thought he would be looked down upon for it.`
`...I remember that when I was around his age, I hated being asked how old I was by adults.`
`...I see, 16, huh?`
`{n}That's gotta be a delicate time.`
`{n}...In that case, I asked something I shouldn't have.`
`"Heh heh~, I'm glad you're about our age!`
` Just be cool and call me Battler!`
` And I'll call you Kanon!"`
`".........Thank you very much.`
` But just the sentiment is sufficient, ...Battler‐sama."`
`Jessica looked flustered for some reason.`
`{n}She seemed to think that my impression of Kanon was worsening because of his rejection.`
`Well, I doubt a girl like Jessica understands his fretful male heart.`
`As his elder—even by just two years—who would lead him into adolescence, I took it upon myself to understand that.`
`"Kanon‐san, could you perhaps be a little more courteous?`
` A smiling face is also the duty of a servant."`
`"...............I apologize.`
` ...I shall make an effort."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` Gohda‐san, Kanon‐kun is trying his best, isn't he?"`
`It seemed as though he was often warned about his discourtesy.`
`{n}And apparently he hadn't improved a bit.`
`Gohda‐san kept his business‐smile, but let a small sigh of resignation escape.`
`"......Well then, I still have work to do.`
` .........If you'll excuse me."`
`It looked like Kanon himself was uncomfortable with remaining silent here any longer.`
`After another perfunctory bow, he turned on his heels and started pushing the wheelbarrow again.`
`Just then, suddenly, the wheelbarrow wobbled and fell, scattering the load.`
`I guess the wheelbarrow with its single wheel caught on a pebble and lost its balance.`
`"What have you done...now now, quickly clean it up...!"`
`Gohda‐san urged him along in a low voice, as if to remind him that it is a servant's shame to present a clumsy appearance in front of guests.`
`Showing that he understood quite well without being told, Kanon‐kun wordlessly reloaded the wheelbarrow with the fallen objects.`
`He seemed to be fine with the light‐looking gardening tools, shovels and such, but he looked like he was having trouble getting his arms around and lifting up some sacks of fertilizer.`
`"Are you alright? You're so careless.`
` Here."`
`"Milady, you will dirty your garments.`
` Please, leave it to him."`
`With an elegant gesture, Gohda‐san took the shovel that Jessica had picked up.`
`At his back was the figure of Kanon‐kun having trouble with the sacks of fertilizer.`
`"......Uu.`
` You'll dirty your garments?"`
`"Don't worry, the ones I'm wearing aren't that elegant."`
`"Besides, I hate guys who make the waitress pick up the fork they dropped at a restaurant."`
`I lifted up the other bags that had fallen.`
`{n}Of course, they weren't light, but for me it was a piece of cake.`
`Kanon‐kun turned his surprised eyes towards me.`
`{n}It was the face of one who would never have expected to receive help from a guest.`
`"............B‐Battler‐sama...`
` That's not necessary... I'll take care of everything, so..."`
`"Don't you worry!`
` I may not look it, but I've got it where it counts!`
` Heheh!"`
`Kanon‐kun looked like he hadn't yet gone through his growth spurt, and was stuck with a sorta weak body.`
`I guess this kind of weight is a bit much for him.`
`"It's quite heavy, isn't it.`
` It's natural that it would be difficult for you.`
` Kanon‐kun, don't worry about it."`
`"OK, my time to shine.`
` This makes up for the boat part from before, right?"`
`"Ha!`
` As if your antics earlier could be written off just like that!`
` Ah‐hah‐hah‐ha!`
` I'll tell you all about it later, Kanon‐kun—Battler is a laugh and a half!"`
`"Gonna faaall gonna faaall!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`Banter made the job seem quick, and before I knew it, all the stuff had been piled back into the wheelbarrow.`
`"............For letting you see such unsightliness, I beg your forgiveness."`
`"Very well, enough now.`
` Please, go."`
`Letting such a disgraceful thing be seen by the guests who were supposed to be made welcome...must have been hideously embarrassing as a servant.`
`Pressed by Gohda to hurry up and exit, Kanon‐kun left.`
`"You're too harsh on him, Gohda‐san.`
` Wouldn't it have been better if you'd helped him, instead of being a bully?"`
`"...You are quite correct.`
` I deeply, deeply implore your forgiveness."`
`Without even a twitch in his smile, Gohda‐san apologized elegantly.`
`"Kanon‐kun has a ton a things he's good at too.`
` It's just that bein' young works against him all the time.`
` It's a cryin' shame."`
`"It's a prickly age.`
` You be nice to him.`
` Keeping a tight lip is just what you want in a servant.`
` Right, Kumasawa‐san?"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho, Rudolf‐sama, you truly are harsh!`
` There is no servant as silent as I, of course!"`
`Everyone smiled wryly at that shameless lie.`
`{n}Even she herself didn't believe that, not in her wildest dreams.`
`{n}She said that to loosen us all up.`
`Yeah, that's the kind of character Kumasawa baa‐chan used to be.`
`The mood that had stiffened a little was cleared up in a twinkling, thanks to Kumasawa‐san's cheerful smile.`
`"I'd like to put down the luggage soon.`
` Gohda‐san, how are we to split up for our rooms?"`
`"It shall be the same as last year.`
` I shall guide you.`
` Please, this way."`
`We headed towards the trim and elegant guesthouse.`
`{n}This was going to be our temporary quarters for a night.`
`".........................................."`
`Kanon watched over a hedge as the guests all entered the guesthouse.`
`Then, he let his eyes fall on those heavy sacks of fertilizer, piled up in the wheelbarrow.`
`In his mind, he kept going over his previous mistake.`
`{n}Battler, big and strong, had picked up the sacks in front of him, the sacks he couldn't lift himself, as if they were feathers.`
`It was extremely difficult for an outside observer to guess what emotions that favor had stirred up in Kanon.`
`But as far as you could tell by watching him hang his head from behind, there was something that he just couldn't let go.`
`...Muttered words escaped his lips.`
`{n}But those words he murmured were so soft that they didn't reach even his own ears.`
`"...............Even I...`
`........................"`
`Kanon hung his head, slightly biting his lower lip...`
`"I remember the rose garden, but...`
`I don't remember this guesthouse at all.`
` Was it built, like, recently?"`
`"Toraian" (Visitor's Retreat) was written on a gatepost‐like thing, but since everyone called it the guesthouse, I followed their lead.`
`The brand‐new Western‐style guesthouse that stood overlooking the rose garden had a magnificent design carefully done in harmony with the garden.`
`"Correct!`
` It was built just the year before last.`
` Since then, we've been having them let us sleep over here."`
`"Hehe, yeah, 'cause people seem to like this place more than that junky old mansion we've had forever.`
` I wish my room was over here!"`
`"Uu!`
` I want one too!`
` Want one too!"`
`...I guess you could call my house upper‐class as well, but I was reminded again how completely ordinary it was compared to the head house.`
`It showed a shocking display of wealth that they would build this kind of awesome guesthouse for guests who come over like once a year.`
`"Eva‐sama, Hideyoshi‐sama.`
` Please, do make use of this room.`
` Rudolf‐sama, Kyrie‐sama, please make use of this room here."`
`"Ah yes, I do appreciate how pretty and elegant this place is.`
` Western style truly is wonderful."`
`"I can handle the Western style for a few days, but any longer than that and you need the good old Japanese style!`
` Japanese people just relax best on tatami mats."`
`"...Haha, they've been fighting over making our new house Japanese‐style or Western‐style.`
` Mother still holds a grudge about Father having started the construction as Japanese‐style, and they bicker all the time about it."`
`"Your parents get along so well, George nii‐san... I'm jealous as hell.`
` Mine are so frosty.`
` And yet they're right with each other when it comes to my grades."`
`All the rooms seemed to be two‐person.`
`{n}I was grateful, because now I wasn't gonna be forced to share the same room with the old bastard for some bullshit reason like "being family".`
`Besides, I figure those two wouldn't be able to enjoy themselves with someone like me around, ihihi.`
`"What's that creepy smile all about?`
` You're thinking about something dirty, aren't you."`
`"Ihihihi~!`
` Something diiirrrty? Of coouurse no~t!`
` Please...enjoy your staaay~!"`
`"Ow, owowowow!`
` That hurts, you old bastard!"`
`Once again, Dad pulled my ears from behind.`
`"Cut the crap.`
` I'm getting a stomachache, and I'm not in the mood for this.`
` You're the guest of honor this time around.`
` You play as nice as possible with Dad and Aniki and the rest."`
`"......At the very least, pay attention to what you say in front of Dad, got it?`
` 'Cause wisecracks go over like a lead balloon with him.`
` ......Jessica‐chan, what's the mood of our family head been like lately?"`
`"...Hmm......`
`same as last year, I guess.`
` ......Considering they keep saying he's got three months left, he's as lively,`
` grumpy,`
` and irritable as ever."`
`"Meaning, he's in his usual bad mood again this year.`
` ......And the only one who's able to take care of him is Genji‐san?"`
`"It seems that the Master will only open his heart to Genji‐san.`
` Lately, us small people cannot even get an audience..."`
`"He's shut himself up in his study again, probably doing nothing but that weird black magic of his.`
` What he does for a hobby is his own damn business, but when he starts stinking up the place, it really gets on my nerves.`
` ...He can just stay in that study and never come out again for all I care.`
` Heheheh!"`
`"You shouldn't talk like that about the elderly.`
` We're all indebted to him, since he rebuilt the Ushiromiya family, and a little gratitude wouldn't hurt."`
`"Hm...well...`
` ......Sorry."`
`After being rebuked by George‐aniki, Jessica had no choice but to take back her thoughtless remark.`
`The Ushiromiya family was wealthy beyond belief, but that, of course, meant that all its members were eccentric people, completely at odds with the rest of society.`
`The Head of the family, standing at its peak—in other words, our Grandfather—seemed to be a particularly eccentric and terrifying person, even for our family.`
`Dad had said he was getting a stomachache earlier, but I guess that was what all the adults who came here today were actually feeling.`
`No doubt they were jealous of us, the grandchildren, just playing and laughing without a care.`
`From the stories Dad told me, the head of the family was a violent man who rained blows on his sons with his own fists and even beat his daughters mercilessly with a wooden sword.`
`If he was such a staunch traditionalist with his kids, why wasn't he the same with their names?`
`Because of that, even us grandkids have to suffer.`
`......Well, I have absolutely no trouble believing the terrifying image they paint of him.`
`I don't have many memories of meeting him over the years, but I remember his face was full of menacing thunder‐clouds, always making the people around him shrink away with a sharp look.`
`I remember that the room's atmosphere got so tense whenever he was around, you couldn't even breathe.`
`What my dad said right now about me being the guest of honor now carries a little more oomph for me.`
`".........Six years ago I was in grade school, but I'm a high‐schooler now, there's no getting away from it.`
` If I don't show him respect, things'll probably get serious.`
` ...Ooo, scary."`
`"He does look frightening, but he's not completely terrifying.`
` He's definitely never unfair.`
` He's just not a pretty talker, that's all."`
`"But George nii‐san, you've been the family darling since like forever because of your awesome grades, right?`
` Grandfather treats us completely different!"`
`"Like me, I've gotten slapped with a wooden sword.`
` On my ass, my ass!`
` On my maidenly naked ass!"`
`"Well, you're the heiress of the head house, Jessica‐chan.`
` Grandfather is giving you special attention.`
` You have to realize that his strictness shows how much he's expecting of you."`
`"Oh, come on.`
` ...Seriously, I could just turn the succession over to you, George nii‐san.`
` It's a bit of a heavy burden for me to carry."`
`I think I already said it before, but Jessica is the daughter who will inherit the head house.`
`{n}The pressure on her shoulders must be different from us cousins of the branch families.`
`".........Uu?`
` Jessica onee‐chan, heavy?`
` If I hold it, will it get lighter?"`
`"Hm?`
` Ahahahaha, thanks.`
` It's alright, it's not gonna get pushed on you, Maria‐chan."`
`"......I'm gonna bear that cross until my grave.`
` ...Don't worry."`
`While grateful for Maria's innocent consideration, it seemed that Jessica could not easily rid herself of the anxiety for the future that remained visible on her face.`
`...I guess I'm no different.`
` Any high‐schooler with exams looming ahead is bound to have an anxiety for the future that they can't hide.`
`"Maria, come here.`
` You'll be in this room with Mom."`
`"Battler‐kun, apparently you are with me in this room here."`
`"Oh?`
` This i~s a surprise!`
` It's bigger than our parents' room, wo~w!"`
`"I figured us cousins are probably all going to gather in one place anyway.`
` So I went and told them to make it a biggish room."`
`"Uu!`
` I like here best too!`
` Here is better than being together with Mama!`
` Uu‐uu!"`
`"Okay, you like it here better too, Maria!`
` Alright, this room is George's and mine, but we'll give you special permission to come in!`
` Keep it a secret from your mom, alright?"`
`"Uu!`
` Secret!"`
`Her mother, Auntie Rosa, was right behind her, but Maria still answered, striking the air with her fists clenched tight.`
`After our parents put the luggage in the rooms, they gathered again in the corridor.`
`"So, brats, what're you gonna do?`
` Are you cousins just gonna stay here and chat?"`
`It seemed they were heading to the mansion to announce their arrival.`
`...Normally, we would have had to follow them and greet everyone together,`
` but if that had been the case, Dad would just have said "You guys come too!" and been done with it.`
`He's telling us that it's alright if we don't come... So what'll we do?`
`"It's gonna be time for lunch soon anyway.`
` Better let the kids unwind here.`
` Besides, if worst comes to worst, this might be the last chance they get to play outdoors."`
`"Uu!`
` I'll go too!"`
`"Maria, you house‐sit for Mama, okay?`
` You behave yourself and wait here."`
`"......Uu."`
`Now that Maria had been told to house‐sit, we couldn't just leave her behind.`
`George‐aniki realized that immediately, and gave a clear reply for all of us.`
`"Well, we'll accept your offer and house‐sit.`
` We have lots of stories to tell each other, after a year."`
`"That would be best.`
` And Battler‐kun has six years' worth to tell, after all!"`
`"Yeah, yeah.`
` I'll take care of the house like a good little boy."`
`"Kumasawa‐san, I'm gonna stay here too!`
` We'll leave the rest to the adults and us kids'll break rank, heheheh!"`
`"That would be for the best, hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` I'll report it to Madam..."`
`"Then, everyone, I will be guiding you to the mansion.`
` Please, this way."`
`"...The other kids aside, George is an adult now. Wouldn't it be better if he came with us?"`
`"If we make him come, poor George'll be the only one left out.`
` Interactin' with his cousins is also important.`
` Well then, see ya, guys!"`
`The adults left one after the other.`
`Like the time he had guided us from the harbor, Gohda‐san went ahead, with Kumasawa‐san at the rear.`
`As we gathered in the cousins' room assigned to us, George‐aniki asked us to excuse him for a second.`
` He rushed over to Kumasawa‐san, who was following behind the disappearing adults, and seemed to be asking her something.`
`He soon finished his business and came back.`
`"What's up, Aniki?"`
`"Ah, nothing.`
` I just wanted to ask something."`
`"Uu!`
` Ask me too!`
` Ask me tooo!"`
`"......Hm~?`
` Hmhuhuhuhu.`
` What could it be that George nii‐san asks Kumasawa‐san and doesn't ask me, I wonder~?`
` Ah, I don't have a clue~!"`
`"No, you misunderstand...!`
` I'm not sure what you're misunderstanding but...!"`
`Aniki was getting pretty tongue‐tied.`
`It's like he has something to hide, and Jessica has the dirt on him.`
`...Whatever it is, something only Jessica knows and I don't is no fun at all!`
`"Hey, Maria, it's not fair that we're the only ones out of the loop, is it no~w?!`
` We wanna hear what they're talking about, don't we~?!"`
`"Uu!`
` Battler and me want to know too!`
` Battler and me want to know too!"`
`""Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!""`
`I fooled around while "uu‐uu"ing together with Maria.`
`"No, I'm telling you...it's no big deal, ahahaha..."`
`"Li~ar!`
` You suck at lying, now confess!`
` Maria, you tickle his right side, I'll tickle his left!"`
`"Uu!`
` Me on the right side, Battler on the left!`
` Uu!"`
`"Wait a second!!`
` Wait you two...!!`
` Ahahaha, stop,`
` ahahahahahaha!!"`
`George‐aniki rolled around on the bed in an effort to get away, and Maria and I played around chasing him.`
`There's something in the back of my mind telling me I'm a high‐schooler now and not a damn kitten, but in spite of that, I missed this kind of fun.`
`A warm kind of fun.`
`"Haahahahaha, what George nii‐san was asking Kumasawa‐san, see...`
` Hmm~?`
` Well, you know how it is.`
` It's been a year since he last came to the head house.`
` Apparently he's really dying to say hi to any servants that might have joined or quit in the meantime, see?"`
`"......Uu?`
` Say hi, I'll say hi too!"`
`"What the hell, that's not anything to feel guilty about, Aniki.`
` ......Hmm~~m?`
` That's not it, is it??`
` Maria, don't be fooled, Aniki's still hiding somethi~ng!`
` Resume interrogation!!`
` Uworyaaa!!"`
`"S‐stop it, seriously!`
` Aahahahahaha!`
` Maria‐chan, you too, stop already!!"`
`"Aahahahahaha, aahahahahaha!`
` *giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"They're probably busy with cleaning or lunch arrangements.`
` It's alright, we'll go and greet them properly afterwards.`
` Basically, you wanted Shannon out there to greet you, not that Gohda getting in the way, right?!`
` Heeheheh!"`
`"Shannon?`
` ......Shannon.`
` ......Aaaaaaaaahh...`
` I remember, that girl!`
` She's still a servant now?`
` How is she?!"`
`"By the way, Natsuhi nee‐san.`
` How's your headache been lately?`
` It seemed to be pretty serious for a time."`
`"...I have been much better lately.`
` Thank you for your concern."`
`"Oh, right, here.`
` A present for you, Natsuhi nee‐san."`
`"......Thank you once again.`
` I'm always receiving gifts from you.`
` ...Is this black tea?"`
`"It's herb tea with peppermint and lemon balm.`
` It's a blend from a famous store and is supposed to be good for headaches.`
` I thought it might help you too."`
`Rosa was always a conscientious woman.`
`...Probably because she was the youngest of four, and by quite some distance,`
` she managed to grow up without harboring the venomosity of her siblings.`
`Her consideration made Natsuhi soften her expression for just a moment,`
` but it wasn't enough to undo the many years of anxiety that had curdled her expression into one of bland indifference...`
`"Oh yes, you always were saying you get those headaches.`
` Pull yourself together.`
` Jessica‐chan will have her exams this year, won't she?`
` Isn't that a turning point in her life?`
` How can she count on her mother like that?`
` Besides, Natsuhi nee‐san, you're three years younger than me.`
` Can't you pull yourself together?"`
`"............`
` .........I apologize.`
` I was born with this discomfort."`
`Eva sometimes fails to choose her words carefully, but even though she hid it with a smile, her comments aimed at Natsuhi contained shards of obvious malice.`
`Of course, that didn't escape Natsuhi.`
`She frantically contained her urge to grimace, and pretended to ignore Eva.`
`"Our Battler‐kun will have his exams this year too, right?`
` Rudolf‐san, shouldn't you be a little concerned too?`
` For the sake of your own son, get serious to the point of getting headaches like Natsuhi nee‐san."`
`"If I say anything, he automatically goes against it.`
` So what should I say—maybe the opposite, that it's okay for him to mess around?`
` That's probably the only thing he'd obediently listen to."`
`"In your family, Hideyoshi nii‐san, didn't George do really well on his exams?`
` Please, teach me the secret to controlling children."`
`"Hmm, well...`
` It's probably because I convinced him why he should study!`
` Study isn't worth anything on its own."`
`"That's right, the real point of studyin' is to train yourself in the art of researchin' what you don't know!`
` If you can't do that, you can't be useful to society!`
` I'm not talkin' about math or writin'.`
` You need to learn how to learn!"`
`"...That's splendid.`
` It would be nice if our Jessica could understand that, though.`
` I don't mean this too seriously, but as it is, as an heiress of the Ushiromiya family, she's—"`
`"Do you really have to force her into becoming the successor?`
` Women have to find their own happiness.`
` Parents shouldn't be deciding that for their children, right?"`
`"Hold your horses, Eva.`
` Each family has its way to raise their children.`
` You shouldn't be pushy."`
`"I'm sorry.`
` Natsuhi nee‐san, don't take it the wrong way."`
`"..........................."`
`Though the light shining in through the window was quite warm despite the cloudy weather, there was a dark mood about the room,`
` ...which probably caused headaches for other people besides Natsuhi.`
`As if to brush away that mood, Kyrie brightly made a suggestion to all present.`
`"Still, this black tea has a really lovely aroma.`
` Let's drink it at once.`
` I believe that in Japan, you can't buy something like Leopold's black tea anywhere but Ginza, right?"`
`"Kyrie nee‐san, how knowledgeable of you.`
` It really was worth buying."`
`Kyrie and Rosa stood up from their seats and made as if to prepare the black tea.`
`{n}Natsuhi forestalled them.`
`"......Thank you both.`
` Let us save that for later.`
` One of our people will soon be coming to bring some tea, so please relax."`
`"Leave it for later, you two.`
` Let them treat us to a "welcome drink" at least."`
`Rudolf gave a subtle signal with his eyes for them to sit down again.`
`{n}...Kyrie and Rosa understood instantly and obediently returned to their seats.`
`The guests had already been greeted, so it was time for some tea to be prepared for them.`
`...That tea was late, and having the guests talk about making some themselves was an embarrassment for the host.`
`Natsuhi bit her lower lip, frustrated with the ineptitude of the servants who were taking too long to bring the tea.`
`...Seeing her face, Eva, without hesitation, started to giggle.`
`......Of course, Shannon had no way of knowing what was taking place in the parlor.`
`As she came in pushing a dish cart piled with tea cups,`
` Natsuhi gave her a pained look for no apparent reason, and Shannon couldn't help but flinch without knowing what she had done wrong.`
`"......E‐excuse me.`
` I shall prepare some tea for you."`
`"Oh, Shannon‐chan, it's been a while!`
` You keep getting prettier every time I see you!"`
`".........Oh,`
` ...um,`
` .........thanks—"`
`"Leave the chatting for after you've set the table.`
` The tea will get cold."`
`"......I, ...I apologize, Madam."`
`She apologized like a small frightened animal, and, bumping against the serving cart, made a jarring racket as she dropped several tea spoons.`
`Her clumsiness made Natsuhi's expression even harsher, which made Shannon in turn quail even more.`
`"It's alright, Natsuhi nee‐san.`
` What does a single greeting matter?`
` We've already been made to wait for so long, the tea must be quite cold anyway.`
` Heheheh."`
`"It, ...it's alright...`
` It's not cold yet, so—"`
`".........Shannon, finish setting the table, quickly."`
`"I, I'm sorry, Madam......"`
`It was obvious that Natsuhi was getting irritated.`
`...The ineptitude that delayed the tea, the clumsiness of the servant—everything pointed to the incompetence of Natsuhi's everyday guidance, making her lose face.`
`As the person in charge of matters of the Ushiromiya head house, allowing that clumsiness to be exposed today of all days was surely nothing less than total humiliation.`
`"Lay off, Natsuhi nee‐san.`
` Don't you think it's a little harsh to bully Shannon‐chan when she's trying her best?"`
`"I'm not bullying anyone...!"`
`"What a nice smell.`
` May I ask you the brand of this tea?"`
`"............Umm...`
`......I'm, ...I'm terribly sorry...`
` I'll find out for you later..."`
`Kyrie had tried to be nice to her, wanting to cut through the tense mood.`
`...However, instead, Shannon had shown a disgraceful display, darkening Natsuhi's face and the room's mood.`
`By this point, Eva's giggles were loud enough to be heard by everyone in the room.`
`"Whaat's thiis?`
` Shannon‐chan, don't you even know what you're pouring us?`
` Come now, you mustn't serve something so suspicious to guests.`
` We'll need a silver spoon at the very least before we can drink this."`
`".........I, ...I'm sorry......`
` I'll go get one immediately—"`
`"Shannon‐chan?`
` Do you know what silver spoons are used for?`
` Or why they have to be silver?`
` Do you know why?"`
`"...............no...`
`.........umm......"`
`Eva's eyes played over Shannon, who was setting the table, as a catty smile floated onto her face.`
`...Taken on its own, the expression on Eva's face may have been charming, in an impish sort of way.`
`However, the words being spun from her lips held within them the keenness of a razor.`
`Shannon tried with all her might to avoid Eva's gaze, which continued to focus on her.`
`Grasping that Shannon was hard‐pressed for an answer, Rosa promptly gave some timely help.`
`"They say that silver dims if it is touched by poison.`
` ...*giggle*, you've learned something, right, Shannon‐chan?"`
`The tea was being treated as undrinkable unless it could first be tested for poison.`
`In Natsuhi's eyes, this was an insult to both the tea...and herself for serving it.`
`Rudolf, laughing flippantly, patted Eva's shoulder.`
`"Haha, you don't need any silver cutlery.`
` With just one lick of your poisonous tongue, even a silver plate would go pitch black."`
`"Wahahahaha!`
` I get to hear that poison‐tongue every day, so I must be poison‐proof by now!`
` Eva, I don't mind you doing it to me, but you've gotta tone it down a smidgen for the poor souls without resistance!`
` Wahahahaha!"`
`"My, how cruel.`
` I only gave Shannon‐chan a bit of information about tea, didn't I?`
` *giggle*."`
`Everyone followed the lead set by Hideyoshi's horselaugh and smiled, though sourly.`
`There remained a single exception to this in Natsuhi, but even so, for the time being, the conversation inside the parlor could now be mistaken for a lively and friendly chat.`
`As Shannon finally finished setting the tea table and made to leave, Kyrie apologized to her in a low voice for not being able to help.`
`...Shannon gave a light bow and made a hasty retreat......`
`Shannon cast her eyes downwards, pushing the cart down the corridor...`
`The pitiful air around her made it obvious that she had borne the brunt of some bullying.`
`"......Don't be sad.`
` You didn't do anything wrong, Nee‐san."`
`"...............You were watching."`
`"That is my duty."`
`"........................"`
`"Madam and Eva‐sama can go to hell.`
` ......But the even worse coward is that guy."`
`Kanon glared hatefully in the opposite direction of the parlor.`
`The preparations for the tea had been delayed by a little bit of trouble in the kitchen.`
`That trouble had not been Shannon's fault.`
`{n}The truth is that it had been Gohda's mistake.`
`In the first place, there was no way that a showoff like Gohda would ever hand over a flamboyant job like carting the tea to the guests.`
`He had needed to make the tea all over again, which had made him late.`
`So, realizing that he wouldn't be earning any brownie points, he had pushed the task of setting the table on Shannon, who happened to be passing by.`
`......One could truthfully call it being shrewd, and one could unquestionably call it cowardice.`
`"......It's alright, Kanon‐kun, thank you.`
` ...I really don't mind..."`
`"................................."`
`Kanon's silence vividly showed that Shannon's words weren't coming from her heart.`
`"............Thank you.`
` Even if you're the only one who understands, I still feel a bit better, I think."`
`"......You bottle things up too much, Nee‐san.`
` ......You should be less hard on yourself for once."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Thanks."`
`Suddenly, they both felt someone's presence and whirled around.`
`An elderly man stood there.`
`{n}It was Genji, the head servant.`
`"..................What are you doing here?`
` ...Shannon, hurry back to the kitchen."`
`"Y‐yes.`
` ......If you'll excuse me......"`
`"................................."`
`Shannon humbly obeyed and promptly made to push the cart and leave.`
`However, Kanon appealed to Genji in silence, bearing something in his eyes that he could not express in words.`
`"...............What is it?`
` Did something happen...?"`
`"...Sha‐`
`......Shannon didn't do anything wrong,`
` but those—"`
`"Stop it, Kanon‐kun..."`
`"......If you'll excuse me.`
` I'll return to work immediately.`
` Kanon‐kun, you too, go back to your post.`
` ......Please."`
`"............If you say so, Nee‐san."`
`"..................`
` ...If there is nothing, then go."`
`"......Yes.`
` ......If you'll excuse me."`
`From the shadows in the hallway, an old woman wearing an apron watched over them. It was Kumasawa...`
`......How heartrending, Shannon‐san, Kanon‐san...`
`There's no reason for those two to be picked on.`
` ...But, it cannot be denied that they are disliked by Gohda‐san...`
`Before Gohda‐san was taken in by the Ushiromiya head house, I heard he worked for a fabulous hotel somewhere.`
`I do think the manner of work he learned there was quite something.`
`It's just that...Gohda‐san is the newest servant here.`
`...He must have a lot of pride accumulated from his previous posts.`
`Because Shannon‐san and Kanon‐kun are his seniors here at the mansion, and yet are inexperienced and have gone through much less in life than he has, he picks on them at every chance he gets...`
`And also, ...although it's terrible, they are hated by Madam Natsuhi too...`
`Of course, in terms of experience, Madam has been in the family much longer.`
`However.........I must feel some sympathy for Madam as well in this case.`
`...The Master is a truly cruel person...`
`Why could he not have realized that his trifling whim would pass such an inferiority complex onto Madam...`
`......Naturally, deep inside, even Madam fully acknowledges that there's no reason to treat those two so harshly...`
`...However, the heart has reasons that reason knows not...`
`Ahh, how heartrending...`
`I cannot do anything but watch over them from the shadows......`
`The four of us cousins were shooting the breeze over all kinds of topics.`
`After all, there are both girls and guys here, plus, we've got people over a wide spread of ages: adult, high school, and elementary school.`
`All each of us had to do was talk about ourselves, and it would be of great interest to the other three.`
`"I think I'm finally getting used to all this.`
` I mean, Jessica and Maria, you've both grown more than I could've imagined over the past six years.`
` So, to be honest, I was feeling a bit uncomfortable, but talking like this, I guess that on the inside, nothing's really changed since back then."`
`"Right back at you.`
` Even after six years, you haven't changed a bit.`
` Although your body's gotten gigantic, you're still a kid inside."`
`"Uu!`
` I'm a kid too!`
` I'm a kid too!"`
`"Well, you aren't gonna be a kid forever, are you, Maria?`
` I mean, you're gonna grow from being a kid to a cute young lady, aren'tcha?`
` And when that happens, that flat‐as‐a‐board chest'll be on Jessica's level, you kno~w?"`
`"When that happens, let me rub it, OK? Promise!!"`
`"Uu!`
` Let you rub it!`
` Promise!`
` Uu!"`
`"N‐no, Maria‐chan!`
` You can't make that kind of promise, that's bad, bad, bad!"`
`"Uu?`
` I promised, so let him rub it!`
` I keep my promises!`
` Always keep them, uu!!"`
`"...Mariaa, you're a really earnest, good girl...`
` The guy you marry's gonna be really lucky."`
`"Just a—Don't try to smooth over the topic with the promise intact!`
` Maria, that promise never happened!`
` Never!"`
`"Uu.`
` Promise cancelled?`
` Uu......"`
`"I realize now, it really didn't feel like a proper gathering of cousins without Battler‐kun in our group, did it?`
` These six years have been kinda lonely."`
`"...That's true.`
` We weren't able to goof off like this.`
` Still, we did have some pretty constructive conversations, don'tcha think?`
` Stuff about preparing for our future, exam‐taking, or finding jobs."`
`"Oo~ooh, I'm sorrryyy!`
` Now that I'm here, there's just this stu~pid babbling!"`
`"But, I'm having fun this year.`
` Uu‐uu!"`
`"That's true.`
` I agree, this year's the most fun."`
`Maria's sincere words probably spoke for everyone.`
`When George‐aniki stroked Maria's head, she giggled like a happy kitten...`
`"......Pardon me.`
` Your meal is prepared."`
`A timid knocking sound and an equally timid young woman's voice came through the door.`
`Jessica answered brightly.`
`"Shannon, come in!`
` You remember Battler, don'tcha?!"`
`Jessica stood up from the bed and opened the door.`
`There stood a servant girl who was definitely about our age.`
`"I‐it's been quite some time since we last met, Battler‐sama.`
` It's nice to see you after six years... I'm Shannon."`
`Noting my presence and trembling a little, she bowed deeply.`
`"...Woww...!`
` Jessica had me surprised, but Shannon‐chan, you've shocked me just as much...`
` You've turned into a total beauty too, haven't you~?!"`
`"Y‐......your words are too good for me......"`
`"Se~riously, the food on this island must be reeeally nutritional, no~?`
` What are you eating, where are you training, to get boobs that big?!!`
` Guess I'll have to feel 'em a bit and see whether yours or Jessica's are bigger, oka~ay?!"`
`With both hands poised and saliva dribbling from my mouth, I closed in!`
`......For the sake of my honor and justice,`
` I'd like to point out that I don't suffer from some strange disease that makes my lymph nodes itch until I scratch my neck open and which can only be prevented by rubbing breasts.`
`It's just my Battler‐style way of communicating.`
`When a boy closes in on a girl like this, nine times out of ten they get slapped or clobbered, right?`
`This is a Battler‐sama original communication technique, aiming for a gag like that to break the ice!`
`.........W‐well, that means I really do get to touch them on that one‐in‐ten chance though, right...?`
`Ihihyahyahya, I'd never ask for that much thouuuugh~!!`
`By now, my hands were less than a centimeter away from Shannon‐chan's chest, but......the counterstrike had yet to come.`
`She understood what was going on, and she was blushing and had her head lowered in embarrassment,`
` but she was just standing there with both hands politely joined in front of her, not even trying to resist or cover her breasts.`
`...Whoaaaaah, I wasn't planning on this!!`
`P‐pl‐please, hit me right now—at this rate I'm seriously gonna touch themmm!`
`...Which is why I was glad that Jessica chose that time to drive her elbow into the back of my head...`
`"Guaaaah, ooooowww, Jessicaaaaaa, thank youuu~!!"`
`"Wh‐wh‐why the hell are you thanking me?!`
` ???"`
`"No, no, my bad, Shannon‐chan.`
` Looks like I got a little too absorbed in your hypnotic chest...`
` No, more to the point, when someone gets that close, they've clearly got criminal intentions!`
` Seriously, you've gotta resist!"`
`".........B‐but...`
`......you are...an exalted guest, Battler‐sama......"`
`"Now look here, a crime's a crime whether I'm a guest or not!`
` Ten centimeters around a girl's chest is like an Air Defense Identification Range.`
` If someone trespasses within two centimeters, that's already an invasion of airspace and you launch a slap to the face on high‐alert!"`
`"............I, I couldn't do such a thing...!`
` We are.........that is, furniture, and..."`
`Of course she didn't want her breasts touched, but...if a guest so desired, she intended to sacrifice her own needs in an effort to accommodate them.`
`...A girl like this needs some urgent protection...!`
`"...I‐in these days, to think that there's a dedicated and virtuous girl like this...`
` It makes my head spin...`
` ......But, no!`
` No, no, nooo!!"`
`"I come at you with a perverted face!`
` You smack me down!!`
` "No~oo, pervert!"`
` You gotta complete the joke or it doesn't work! Please, it's a polite request, smack me!`
` Like this, smack!`
` Smaaa~ck!!"`
`"I............I cannot comply with polite requests.`
` Because I'm furniture.`
` ......But,`
` ............I will comply with it if it's an order.`
` ...Because that is my duty."`
`"Ahaha, then I'll make it an order.`
` From now on, if Battler‐kun tries to touch your breasts, you are to counterattack with a slap.`
` Alright?"`
`"......Y‐yes.`
` As you command.`
` That is what I will do from now on.`
` Battler‐sama, I hope you can keep this in mind..."`
`So Shannon‐chan declared, while bowing elegantly to me.`
`Her facial expression was radiant.`
`{n}I gave her a thumbs‐up to signal "you got it".`
`"Six years ago, you might've been mistaken for a servant's daughter who just came in to lend a hand sometimes,`
` ......but now you're a full‐fledged adult servant.`
` How many years has it been?"`
`"Well,`
` I've had the pleasure of serving this household for about ten years."`
`She's {p:0:紗音}.`
` ......The kanji for her name are read as "Shannon".`
`{n}This is another far‐from‐typical name for a Japanese person.`
`Being a kid back in those days, I had taken in her name without paying it much attention,`
` but for her to be called something like that is pretty unusual given that she isn't even a member of the Ushiromiya family.`
`...Maybe it's like a servant's "professional name" or something.`
`...If so, I can kind of understand why that Kanon‐kun's name sounds the way it does, too.`
`She's a long‐term servant who's served here since she was six.`
`Since her body had changed radically, she didn't match my memories, but we used to know each other six years ago.`
`It looked like she was just as shy as she had been in the past, but I got the sense that she had become imbued with the charm befitting a girl her age.`
`Especially her breasts, her breasts.`
`"That kid we met earlier, Kanon‐kun, is her little brother."`
`"...He's not exactly my little brother...`
` Still, he loves me like a big sister.`
` ...He didn't cause you any trouble, did he?"`
`"Haha!`
` He's the same as always.`
` It's such a shame that he doesn't act just a bit more sociable."`
`"...It seems Kanon‐kun has caused trouble... I apologize......"`
`"He didn't cause any trouble at all!`
` As a fellow man, I understand how moody you can get at that age.`
` It's no surprise that he's unsociable!"`
`"Uu!`
` I get called that all the time too!`
` Get called unsociable!`
` Like Kanon!`
` Uu!"`
`"*giggle*......Maria‐sama, you are not unsociable at all."`
`"Uu?`
` It was nice to be like him...`
` Uu."`
`"Umm, you said the meal was ready, right?"`
`"Ah, ......yes!`
` My apologies!`
` ...The preparations for your meal have been carried out, so I shall be guiding you all to the mansion."`
`Shannon bowed again formally and returned to her "duty mode".`
`We realized that if we made her stick around for any more light conversation,`
` it would actually make it harder for her to do her job, so we got up off our butts to avoid interfering with her work any further.`
`"Shall we go to the mansion, then?`
` You're all probably starting to get hungry as well, right?"`
`"Sure am.`
` I always look forward to meals when Gohda‐san's here cooking.`
` That guy, seems he was a chef at this famous hotel, so he's super good at it!"`
`"Oh‐hoh!`
` I'm looking forward to tha~t!!`
` Let's go Maria!`
` We're gonna stuff ourselves like pigs!!"`
`"Uu!`
` Stuff ourselves like pigs!"`
`"No, no!`
` You can't just take everything Battler‐kun says seriously, OK?`
` Because it's all jokes.`
` Come on, let's go."`
`Under Shannon‐chan's guidance, we headed towards the mansion.`
`Met once again by the magnificent rose garden, we continued onward as it came into view: .........the imposing mansion of the Ushiromiya main family.`
`It had apparently been built shortly after the war, so you could feel the dignity of almost a half‐century hanging about it.`
`On the surface, the building was gorgeous, but being as old as it was, it was seemingly lacking in modern amenities like air conditioning.`
`According to Jessica, midwinter was especially tough, what with all the drafts.`
`...Well, it's not like they couldn't just take the {c:86ef9c:kotatsu} out.`
`As we entered the entrance hall, an aged servant greeted us.`
`{n}Now him I remembered.`
`As the most senior member of the staff, Genji‐san ({p:0:源次}) served as the head of the servants.`
`"............Battler‐sama, we have not met in a long while."`
`As our eyes met, he saluted us with a composed voice.`
`He didn't give quite as refined a bow as Gohda's,`
` but it was a bow that had feeling, even if it wasn't polished to the same degree.`
`"Genji‐san, it's been absolutely ages!`
` You look well."`
`"Thank you, I have been quite well...`
` ......And you, Battler‐sama, I see have become a splendid young man yourself.`
` .........I would even say you have grown to somewhat resemble the Master during his youth."`
`"I'm looking like Grandfather?`
` I guess that means Grandfather was pretty popular when he was young, ihihi!"`
`".........From here on, I shall take Shannon's place and accompany you.`
` Please, come this way."`
`Shannon‐chan bowed deeply and saw us off.`
`Leaving the entrance hall, we headed to the dining hall under Genji‐san's guidance.`
`Genji‐san, just like Kumasawa‐san, stood in stark contrast to us young people who had grown beyond recognition over the last six years.`
`His figure was exactly the same as in my memories of six years ago.`
`{n}It seemed like time had stopped since the last we met.`
`Genji‐san was a silent and diligent person.`
`{n}He was like Grandfather's close aide or caregiver,`
` ......in fact, you could even go so far as to say he was Grandfather's right‐hand man.`
`Actually, it seems that he was by Grandfather's side more than my late Grandmother was.`
`According to Jessica, Grandfather trusts him more than any of his blood relatives.`
`But I wonder how long he's served.`
`{n}I've never asked for details, but I think I heard he's been here since the beginning, when this mansion was constructed.`
`...That is to say, he's dedicated half of his life to serving here.`
` ...No wonder Grandfather trusts him.`
`As we cut through the open‐ceilinged hall behind Genji‐san,`
`......I found something I had no memory of from six years ago.`
`It was an awfully big portrait hung right in front of the stairs that rose to the second floor.`
`Without thinking, I stopped walking, under its spell...`
`{n}Since I'd suddenly stopped, Maria, who was following behind me, ran into my back.`
`"Uu?"`
`"......Aah, sorry.`
` ...Hey, Jessica.`
` Did that picture use to be there?"`
`I pointed at the large and conspicuous portrait hanging in the hall.`
`{n}Everyone else stopped too.`
`"...Ahh...right.`
` When you last came here, that hadn't been hung yet, had it?`
` When was it again..."`
`"I think,`
` ......if my memory doesn't fail me, it was around the year before last."`
`"............You are correct.`
` In April of the year before last, the Master had this painting put on display, which he had instructed an artist to paint for him some time prior."`
`"Grandfather did that?`
` So, he went out of his way to have it drawn..."`
`The portrait depicted a woman in an elegant dress, who gave off a sense of refinement, and who seemed to suit the Western style of this mansion.`
`.........I couldn't have guessed her age, but the sharpness and obvious strength of will in her eyes gave me the impression of youth.`
`It was a different feeling than the composed mood of middle‐aged women that are often in famous pictures.`
`If this woman had normal black hair, I might have thought it was a portrait of my long‐deceased grandmother in her prime.`
`However, the woman in the portrait had beautiful golden hair, and didn't look Japanese at all.`
`"So.`
` ......Who is she then, this woman?"`
`As though trying to show off her knowledge, Maria answered that simple question with authority.`
`"Uu!`
` I know.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}!"`
`"Bea......what?"`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` She's the witch.`
` Didn't you ever hear about her, long ago?"`
`"The witch?`
` ...You mean...`
`.........of this island?"`
`...I think I already said this, but Rokkenjima is a small island that's only about ten kilometers around.`
`However, considering that only the Ushiromiya family lives here, that's quite large.`
`So, only a harbor and the site around the mansion were set up to be lived in;`
` beyond that, the island remained as untouched as it was when it was still uninhabited.`
`To understand just how dangerous a vast and empty forest with no lamplight, phones or people passing through it at all actually is,`
` you need to shift your urban assumptions a little.`
`You see, if by any chance you fell down a hole in the depths of the forest and sprained your ankle...`
`cry or scream, no one would come save you.`
`If it then got dark, the forest, where there are no streetlights, would become enshrouded in complete darkness.`
`Also, since there obviously aren't any guideposts here, it's easy to get lost and lose your sense of direction in the dark forest.`
`Nowadays, most people see a forest as a peaceful place,`
` but to the people of bygone eras, before the light of civilization drove out the night, forests were like oceans on land, geographically separating one culture from another.`
`Just as fishermen who go out into the ocean occasionally have their lives put in danger despite their technical knowledge...`
`...technical knowledge was also demanded of hunters who went out into the forest,`
` and their lives were occasionally put in danger just the same.`
`...If a child were to go play in that dangerous forest, something terrible might happen.`
`Some parent must have had that thought.`
` ...Maybe my Grandmother, or possibly, the man himself, my grandfather might have said it.`
`Or maybe it was a story handed down on this island from long, long ago.`
`{i:.........There's a terrible witch in the forest, so you must not go in.}`
`Thus, Rokkenjima's ghost story was born.`
`{n}That is the legend of the witch of Rokkenjima.`
`So, when we say "witch" on this island, we're referring to the master of the vast and savage forest.`
`Which reminds me, when I was little and stayed at this mansion, during the eerie nights where the wind and rain struck the windows,`
` stories like "the witch of the forest is roaming around in search of a sacrifice" would scare the heck out of me...`
`{f:5:Beatrice},`
` ...huh.`
`.........As I searched my memory prompted by Aniki, I did vaguely remember being told that was her name, when I was very small.`
`"...Riiight.`
` Still, I completely forgot that the witch of that legend had an elegant name like {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......Goddamn, don't tell me Grandfather went out of his way to have her depicted in this painting just because us grandchildren refused to believe him?"`
`"......It's the witch from Grandfather's delusions.`
` ...Ever since he had this picture hung up, he's been losing the distinction between fantasy and reality."`
`"......To us, it's no more than the witch from his imagination, but to Grandfather, she's a being who "exists" on this island.`
` ......‘Exists’.`
` That's why he says he had that picture painted—so that we'd understand."`
`".........Hmpf, creeps the hell outta me."`
`"........................Milady.`
` ...To the Master, this is an important portrait.`
` ......I must request strongly that you not say such a thing in front of him."`
`".........I know that.`
` You couldn't get me to say it even if you begged me."`
`Jessica turned away, after glaring a second at the portrait.`
`"...Let's go.`
` We're making everyone wait in the dining hall."`
`"Uu!`
` Hungry!"`
`......Only a small portion of this island is controlled by the Ushiromiya family.`
`If all of the wild remainder...was the witch {f:5:Beatrice}'s domain...`
`......then one could say that she was the being who actually ruled over Rokkenjima.`
`That unsettling ominous feeling I had felt on the boat trip, when I learned that the shrine had been struck by lightning, revived within me a bit.`
`At that time, Kumasawa‐san had tried to tell an ominous story about Rokkenjima and had been stopped by Jessica.`
`.........I didn't know what she had tried to tell us about this island.`
`But, there was one thing I did know.`
`{n}...Rokkenjima's ruler was not the Ushiromiya family.`
`It was the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}Yes.`
` ......Because this was the witch's island.`
`"Battlerrr!`
` Uu, slooww!"`
`When I looked around, everyone was already heading towards the dining hall.`
`{n}I hurriedly chased after them...`
`We walked up to the huge double doors that led to the dining hall.`
`Genji‐san knocked.`
`"......I have brought the children.`
` If you will excuse me..."`
`The door was opened and we were invited inside.`
`The dining hall, which screamed "filthy rich", featured a super‐long table which was obviously designed with no other purpose than to make the guests conscious of their rank,`
` and our parents were already seated at it in accordance with that ordering.`
`"You're late, brats.`
` Hurry up and take your seats."`
`The old bastard pressed us to sit.`
`Only the places where we would sit were empty at the long table, which only made us feel our tardiness all the more.`
`The seat at the very head of the table, which you might call the seat of honor, was for the most highly ranked, and reserved for Grandfather.`
`It was still empty.`
`{n}...He was probably planning to come in last to make himself look important.`
`The seating order, as you faced the seat of honor, went from left to right in rows of two, with the ranking being lower the further you were from it.`
`So, on the left‐hand side of the row closest to the seat of honor was the second‐ranked seat, belonging to the eldest of the adult siblings—Uncle Krauss.`
`.........It looked like he hadn't arrived yet either, so that seat was empty.`
`And then opposite him, on the right‐hand side of the first row, sat the eldest daughter of the family, Auntie Eva, ranked at number three.`
`The left‐hand side of the second row was for number four.`
`{n}There sat the old bastard, Rudolf, as the third of the siblings.`
`Opposite him sat number five, the youngest sibling, Auntie Rosa.`
`Going like this, you might think that the next ones to come would be their husbands and wives, but...`
`guess again, because the left‐hand seat in the following third row, meaning rank number six, was actually Jessica's seat.`
`Opposite her was George‐aniki.`
`Then, the seat next to Jessica was me,`
` and opposite me was Maria.`
`And next to me, on the left‐hand side of the fifth row, all the way down at number ten, finally came Aunt Natsuhi.`
`...Opposite her was Uncle Hideyoshi,`
` and next to Aunt Natsuhi, in the sixth and final row on the left‐hand side, was Kyrie‐san.`
`The seat opposite to Kyrie‐san had been laid out like the others, but was empty.`
`According to this ranking system, that spot was the seat where Auntie Rosa's husband should be sitting.`
`......He hasn't come, as far as I know, yet the table had been laid for his seat.`
`These kind of ranking orders usually permit the spouse a corresponding status, but the Ushiromiya family had an original kind of ranking.`
`......Maybe it's a leftover of male chauvinism.`
`{n}Under the notion that a mother's womb is only a temporary house for the child and she contributes no genes, the children of direct descent would have the highest ranking, followed by the grandkids.`
`Meaning that the spouses, with no blood ties, would be considered the last in line.`
`......It's terrible, but according to that ranking order, Grandmother, if she was still alive,`
` would be in a position even lower than mine.`
`In youth, obey your father; after marriage, your husband; after aging, your children.`
`A leftover of the times when they used to say, "Women: no home in three worlds".`
`Long ago, when I was still incapable of figuring all this out,`
` I'd thought it was so great that we could all chat with the adult siblings sitting in their group and us cousins in ours.`
` However, now that I can reexamine the seating order after growing up a bit, it stirs up some very complicated feelings in me...`
`Aunt Natsuhi, married to the eldest son of the family, responsible for managing the household, and number two for all practical intents and purposes, sat to my right,`
` ...which meant that she was two steps lower than me in the ranking order.`
`...It was difficult to guess what was going through her head.`
`{n}That's why I made a small apologetic gesture before sitting down.`
`"How nice to see you, Battler‐kun.`
` You've grown quite tall, haven't you?"`
`"Huh, ah, yeah!`
` Normal life—you know, food, meals, eating—then suddenly I was this tall."`
`"Boys do grow fast, don't they?`
` How tall are you?"`
`"I guess about 180 cm?`
` No, wait, you missed your moment, you're supposed to jump in with "Did you do anything besides eat?!""`
`"Huh?`
` ......Ahh, *giggle*, I'm sorry."`
`After a moment, she gave a small laugh, but it seemed she couldn't quite figure out what she was supposed to be laughing at.`
`This woman is Aunt Natsuhi ({p:0:夏妃}).`
`She's the wife of the eldest son of the family, meaning she is my dad's older brother's wife.`
`Is it easier to get it if I call her Jessica's mother?`
`...It feels bad to say it like this, but—not that I hated her—but I didn't particularly like her.`
`She never got into our kids' circle, and my only impression of her was as someone who always talked about complicated stuff with my parents while having a crabby expression on her face.`
`...The fact is, that having barely ever exchanged words, I hesitated a lot even just now about how to approach her.`
`...Aaand it was pretty much a flop.`
`The silverware had been tidily set up on the table, but the meal itself hadn't been brought in.`
`As a rule, the meal doesn't start until the man at the head of the table has taken his seat.`
`{n}So, as long as Grandfather—the highest ranked—didn't come, lunch would be indefinitely on hold.`
` Not even the appetizers would come.`
`In other words, this silence in the dining hall was the sound of our parents as they withstood their hunger and waited, on tenterhooks, for Grandfather to come.`
`Except—the Grandfather I remembered always showed up at the right time when we ate together like this.`
`...He wouldn't ever have been so late as to have everyone else waiting on him.`
`"Grandfather's pretty late.`
` ......As far as I can remember, he was always strict about staying on time."`
`"Well, maybe six years ago, yeah.`
` ...But not lately.`
` Seriously, he's off in his own little world now—he doesn't even show up at family meals.`
` ...I figured he'd at least stick around for today's meal, though."`
`"...That said, if he doesn't turn up, I'll be a hell of a lot more relaxed and happier to boot."`
`"...Jessica!"`
`After being scolded by her mother, Jessica faced the other way, sticking her tongue out.`
`......No way around it.`
`{n}Nothing to do but wait for the host to arrive.`
`When I glanced at the clock, I saw that it was almost twenty minutes past twelve...`
`The aged master of the Ushiromiya head house, Ushiromiya Kinzo ({p:0:金蔵}).`
`{n}He was there in his study.`
`The clock showed noon, but he didn't even attempt to get up.`
`With reading glasses on his face, he stacked up old‐fashioned books with elaborately designed bindings one on top of another beside him, immersing himself in their reading.`
`It definitely didn't look like it was for his leisure; on the contrary, he exuded impatience, crisis, as though every minute, every second were precious.`
`The sealed room was dense with dancing dust particles, and the air stagnated with a mix of smells of various elixirs, each giving off its own suspicious stench.`
`...They were somehow sweet, and heavy.`
`For anyone with a good nose, the first thing they'd do after entering would be to open a window and ventilate the room.`
`The knocking against the study door had been going on for a while.`
`A voice calling "Father" sometimes mingled with the knocks.`
`As Kinzo heaved a deep sigh, he snapped shut the old book he had in his hands, and slammed it on the table.`
`Then, he yelled at Krauss who was continuing to knock on the door.`
`"Silence!!`
` Will you not stop that noise, fool!!!`
` Who taught you that doors shall be opened unto you if you knock?!`
` They crucified that imbecile!!`
` Do you wish the same upon yourself?!!"`
`"......Father.`
` Today is the day of the family conference—it comes just once a year.`
` Everyone has gathered downstairs.`
` Please come out."`
`Krauss called out to his father through the door.`
`{n}...Kinzo always shut himself up in the study and hated letting even his family into the room.`
`For that reason, Krauss had no choice but to call out thus from the corridor...`
`"Molest me not!!`
` Everyone? Who is "everyone"?! You refer to the fools trying to drag me out of here?!!"`
`"Then kill them all!`
` Chop them up, make them into firewood, feed them to the witch's hearth!!`
` Put a pot in that hearth and boil wormwood!`
` And if still there remain imbeciles foolish enough to dare try to lure me out of here, force them to drink that broth of the Apocalypse!`
` Preserve the remainder in liquor!"`
`"Aah, Genji, where are you?!`
` Call for Genji!!`
` Have my demonic absinthe prepared!`
` The whispering of the green fairy reaches me no longer!!`
` Aah, where is Genji, call for GenjiiIii!!!"`
`...Before the door, Krauss, Nanjo, and Genji kept waiting for the master of the house, who would not come out.`
`"Hmph...`
` ......Looks like he hates me to his core.`
` My voice doesn't reach him anymore."`
`Krauss shrugged as though saying "It's no use", and smiled bitterly.`
`...He himself hadn't believed for a moment that his father would answer his calls.`
`{n}However, as it was the duty of the eldest son, he had formally made the request.`
`"......Kinzo‐san.`
` Your sons, daughters, and grandchildren have come to see you, you know...`
` How about you show your face, just a little...?"`
`"Shut up, be silent!!!`
` You dare admonish me, Nanjo?!!`
` I do not call for you, I said to call for Genji!!`
` Now hurry, call for him this instant!`
` Time is short—the apostles are already readying their trumpets—why do you not understand this, you foolish sheep!!"`
`Kinzo slammed the old, heavy book on the table over and over.`
`{n}The racket obviously indicated his highest displeasure.`
`Kinzo put his spectacles down and flew up from his chair.`
`He spread his arms wide open, as if to sing to a packed opera house, as if appealing to someone, and yelled.`
`"Why?!`
` Why is there always something in my way?!`
` I would throw it all away, I would offer up everything, and there is only one thing I ask in repayment!!"`
`"Ohh, {f:5:Beatrice}, if I could see your smile but one more time, I would plunder the smiles of the Earth and offer them all up to you!!`
` Oooh, commanders of the locust legions, reap the smiles of the Earth, *coughcough*, *haaack* *kofkof*!!!`
` Ahh, all is filthy, all is irksome!!"`
`"Why must I suffer this impediment on this most precious of days?!?!`
` *haaack*kofkofkof*!!`
` *cough*cough*!!!`
` Call for GenjiiIii!!!`
` *haaack*kofkof*!!"`
`"......I have no idea what he's yelling.`
` I guess he's finally gone nuts."`
`"Krauss‐san...`
` Isn't that a bit harsh, to your birth father..."`
`"My dad is already dead.`
` ......All that's here is a phantom of what he once was.`
` At any rate, as long as he lacks the will to leave that room, there's nothing we can do."`
`".....................Kinzo‐san."`
`Choking coughs continued to pour from the study...`
`"I'm going back downstairs.`
` ......It would be a waste to let that lunch Gohda's so proud of get any colder.`
` It's one of the few things the others have to look forward to here.`
` ...Hmph."`
`Krauss spun on his heels.`
`He looked at his wristwatch, mumbling and acting as though he had wasted time doing something he knew would be in vain.`
`"Genji‐san.`
` ......Father is calling for you.`
` Keep him company."`
`".........Certainly."`
`"Doctor Nanjo.`
` Let's go eat.`
` ......If we stay here any longer, even our sense of taste will go insane from this sweet smell."`
`Without waiting for Nanjo, Krauss went downstairs.`
`Genji urged Nanjo to go and eat.`
`...Nanjo looked first to Krauss's back as he disappeared down the stairs, then to the study door, and he let out a deep sigh.`
`"......Sorry, Genji‐san.`
` Please."`
`"Yes, ......please leave it to me."`
`"If possible, don't give him alcohol.`
` ......It's too powerful a habit."`
`"Is Genji not here yet?!!!`
` Who dares keep Genji from coming?!!`
` Ahh, where is Genji, call for Genji!!!"`
`"Now,`
` ......please leave it to me."`
`"...Mm.`
` .........Sorry."`
`Nanjo gave a small duck of his head and descended the stairs...`
`Genji saw him off, and knocked at the study door.`
`"..........My lord.`
` It is Genji."`
`"Genji!!`
` Why must you make me wait so long?!!`
` There is no one there, I trust?!"`
`"Yes.`
` I am alone."`
`Kinzo returned to his seat in the study and pressed an old‐fashioned switch on the table.`
`...After a small delay, the heavy sound of the door unlocking could be heard.`
`Kinzo believed that his family might try to break into his study.`
`Perhaps someone once opened the window for some air and scattered some important documents or something,`
` and that had made him extremely upset.`
`...Now, Kinzo had placed a secure lock in his room,`
` making it so that without his permission nobody could enter, and locking himself in the dungeon he himself created.`
`Genji, who he trusted the most, was relatively free to enter the room, but even that was not absolute.`
`If Kinzo was in a bad mood, even he wouldn't be able to enter.`
`.........Anyone else would be limited to holding a conversation through the door, not even seeing his face.`
`And most of the time, they wouldn't even get a real conversation.`
`However, that didn't pose any particular problem for the family.`
`That was because they had no reason to go out of their way to interfere with the retirement of the cantankerous and aged head; the fact that he was completely immersed in his odd research and always locked up in his hideaway was something of a benefit.`
`......They made the most of his refusal to leave the study, entrusting him to the hands of the servants, while they themselves kept their distance.`
`"Genji, my usual.`
` I'm busy."`
`"......Yes."`
`Genji headed to a corner of the study.`
`{n}There, suspicious‐looking bottles boasting venomous colors were on display.`
`...They were actually liquor, but considering that they were placed in this shady‐looking room, you could almost suspect that they might be ghastly poisons.`
`The inside of the study was filled with the mountainous library of outlandish books that Kinzo had amassed.`
`They were bizarre old books, some banned, and each and every one of them either forbidden, cursed, or sealed.`
`Of course, if one were to actually call them old books, Kinzo would fly into a rage and say something like this:`
`{i:"Call them...}`
`{i:grimoires!"}`
`There were candles which had melted in a suspicious‐looking fashion and taken on peculiar forms, and all manner of other strange objects, probably having something to do with black magic.`
`The constellations covering the celestial globe would have caused anyone who knew the night sky well to raise an eyebrow.`
`The illustrations inscribed in old books, haphazardly left open, ranged from the religious and mystical...`
`to the demonic and grotesque, as well as bizarre diagrams of various magic circles.`
`And above all, the sweet, poisonous smell that filled the room,`
` which to those entering for the first time would surely be a profound assault on their sense of sight, smell, and all their other senses, making them lose their grip on reality...`
`Inside that study, Genji, with his well trained hand, prepared Kinzo's usual drink.`
`If you didn't know that the ghastly dark green liquid that filled the complexly designed bottle was liquor, you certainly wouldn't want to put it in your mouth.`
`......He poured a small quantity of the spirit into the glass,`
` placed a cube of sugar in a strangely shaped spoon, and then poured water from a pitcher over it.`
`Strangely, when the colorless water was poured into it, the dark green liquid turned a cloudy white.`
`...It created the strange visual illusion that the water had caused a chemical reaction, which made it all the more difficult to perceive the concoction as liquor.`
`To this, he added an original flavoring that Kinzo liked, and fine‐tuned the taste.`
`...There was no recipe.`
` Its success was measured only by Kinzo's mood swing when he drank it, and he had learned how to make it only after many decades.`
`Genji placed the glass on a tray, and made his way over to Kinzo.`
`{n}Kinzo was now gazing out the window.`
`".........As you asked, my lord."`
`"Thank you..."`
`Kinzo had regained his composure—so much so that he was now unrecognizable as the man who had been shouting, screaming and yelling just moments before.`
`In that man's back dwelt a dignity and intelligence made plain simply by how he tilted his glass and gazed down at the scenery beyond the window.`
`Genji, in order to allow Kinzo to set down his glass any time,`
` motionlessly waited behind and to his left, as though he were a living sideboard.`
` As he did, Kinzo stuck out just the glass, his gaze still directed at the world outside the window.`
`There was just a mouthful remaining.`
`It was not a gesture intended to set it upon the tray, as Genji expected, but was a motion to hand the glass over to Genji.`
`"......Drink it.`
` ...My friend."`
`".....................That is more than I deserve."`
`"No need for ceremony between us.`
` ......Drink it.`
` Friend."`
`"...............Thank you."`
`Genji respectfully received the glass and inclined it a little to taste its contents.`
`Then, he downed it in one gulp.`
`"I attempted to imitate your concoction, but no matter how I try, I cannot replicate the taste.`
` ......The way you make it is pure relish."`
`".........Thank you very much.`
` It is the fruit of your guidance, my lord."`
`"Hmph..."`
`Kinzo smiled at his loyal subject who refused to put aside rank even when asked to.`
`However, he was not making fun of him; it was relaxed, like a smile at a close friend's unriddable bad habit.`
`".........We have grown old, you and I.`
` I forgot my age a long time ago."`
`"That I was permitted to live the life I have until today has all been thanks to you, my lord."`
`Kinzo gave a thin smile, as if to say he didn't need compliments.`
`".........You have served me exceedingly well these years.`
` ......My sons call me eccentric.`
` The servants that were once many, all of them, retired in their growing fear of me.`
` ......Only you, even now, serve me."`
`"...That is more than I deserve."`
`".........I doubt I have much time left to live.`
` ......My sons are vultures, lazily waiting for my inheritance to fall into their hands."`
`"........................"`
`"That fool Krauss squanders money like water, throws away two gold coins to obtain one.`
` With that, he deludes himself into saying he earned money!!`
` Eva is a slave to money, thinking of me as a hen or whatnot!!`
` As if when I die, she'll even use my carcass to make broth!!"`
`"That dunce Rudolf just wants to fool around with women!!`
` Rosa bore the baby of a nobody!!`
` Jessica is incompetent and illiterate!!`
` George has none of what it takes to be a man!`
` Battler is a fool who threw away the honor of the Ushiromiya family!!`
` And Maria is obscene to the eye!!"`
`"Why, why is the Ushiromiya blood so incompetent?!!`
` Is there anyone worthy to inherit the glory I built?!`
` Ahh, of course, I know, this is {f:5:Beatrice}'s curse, I know it!!`
` ...Aah, Golden Witch, is this supposed to be your revenge against me?"`
`"Hate me if you wish!`
` Run away if you wish!!`
` I won't let you go, I won't let you go won't let you go won't let you go!!`
` You are mine!!`
` You cannot be anywhere but in my arms!`
` You are my entire life!"`
`"You'll continue to whisper for all eternity in my bird cage to me, only to me!!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}......`
` Why...won't you give me back your smile...`
` OOOoooooh, OOOooOOOoooh...!!`
` {f:5:BeatriceeEeEEeeEee}!!`
` OOOoooOOOOoohh......"`
`After howling, Kinzo choked once again.`
`{n}Genji set the tray and the glass down and patted his master's back...`
`Genji's facial expression did not change.`
`{n}.........It was always like this.`
`"............*cough*...`
` Hmhm.`
` ............Thank you, my friend."`
`"........................"`
`After his almost deranged outburst of the past few minutes settled down, Kinzo regained his composure once more.`
`...The way his attitude changed was like seeing two different people, a wild Kinzo and a composed Kinzo, living together inside one body.`
`"And so,`
` ......I have decided.`
` .....................I cannot stand spending the insipid remainder of my life procrastinating like this.`
` If I have any final coins left to gamble, then I choose to abandon them all to the whims of the Demons' Roulette."`
`"......The power of magic is always determined by the risk staked upon it.`
` Like visiting a shrine at the Hour of the Ox in ancient Japanese sorcery, to nail a curse doll to a tree.`
` The magic power dwells in incurring the risk that it will be seen before seven days pass.`
` The more dangerous the risk, the stronger the magic power will be."`
`"All the various miracles that appear in myth can be called crystals of astonishing magic power, obtained through miraculously low probabilities and astronomical risks!"`
`"That Moses parted the sea was no miracle of God's—`
`it was that utterly desperate risk, weighed upon the scales of oppression, of being cornered by soldiers on the Red Sea's shores, which gave birth to miraculous magic power!`
` Even if the same thing occurs again, on the same scope, the sea will no doubt not part."`
`"That is because Moses managed to spectacularly draw out the single miracle carved in the roulette of those in power, which has more pockets than {c:86EF9C:asougi (10⁵⁶) and nayuta (10⁶⁰)} multiplied together."`
`"The power to triumph over astronomical odds!!`
` Yes, magical power is, in other words, having the luck to grasp miracles!!`
` To obtain great magical power, one must bear a risk that is hopelessly great!!`
` Those who possess no magic would call this not a bet, but pure desperation!"`
`"However, those who truly do possess magical power can grasp hold of that miracle and make the enigma come into being!!`
` And if that power exists within me!`
` I will seize that miracle, I will be able to make the wish I devoted my life towards come true!!"`
`Kinzo looked up to the sky outside the window.`
`{n}He spread his arms as if appealing to someone up in the skies.`
`"And if...!!!`
` If I were to have what it takes to obtain that miracle...!!`
` .........Oooh...`
`{f:5:Beatrice}...`
`{f:5:Beatrice}...`
` Show me your lovely smile once more..."`
`"No matter how much time passes, your face does not vanish...`
` I just want to see your smile...that is all...!`
` I'll return everything you granted me!`
` I'll return all the glory I've gained since that day!`
` I don't need fortune, prestige, gold!!`
` I'll return everything you granted me!!"`
`"I just want to see your smile!!`
` I beg of you, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` OOOoooooOooh...oOoOOoh...ooh...!!"`
`......His nonsensical yells segued into a scream, ...and then into a wail.`
`Kinzo crumpled onto the floor, and clawed at it with both hands.`
`Genji had no choice but to wordlessly watch over his master's lament...`
`"Well, ladies and gentlemen.`
` ......The head of the family is not in his best shape.`
` He considers it a great shame that he will not be able to partake in lunch with you all, you having assembled especially for this long‐awaited yearly meeting."`
`"......Gohda, let the lunch begin."`
`"Certainly. Well then, ladies and gentlemen, we shall begin today's luncheon."`
`"......Doctor Nanjo, is Father's condition that bad?`
` Surely he could have at least showed his face?"`
`"Rather than his physical condition, it's his mood...`
` And for that, there is no medicine I can prescribe."`
`"Oh, come on, for God's sake, "mood", again?`
` We come to hear how he's doing, making time in our schedules in this damn busy season of autumn.`
` That's just—"`
`"Hmph...then you got what you wanted, Rudolf.`
` You managed to {i:hear how he's doing}.`
` ......Or do you want to take my place, and try to persuade our ill‐humored father to come join us?"`
`"............Are you kidding?"`
`Rudolf shrugged.`
`Apparently, even though Rudolf seemed to resent the way his father did whatever he pleased, he'd rather avoid seeing his face if he could help it.`
`"Does it seem like his mood will improve before dinner?`
` Krauss nii‐san?"`
`"I have no idea.`
` You can try to ask Father directly.`
` ...Although, I think his mood will improve faster if we don't bother him."`
`"The only one who can bring Grandfather's temper under control is Genji‐san.`
` Pretty damn pathetic when you have to have a servant to deal with your own parent's bad mood."`
`"Jessica.`
` Don't speak out of turn."`
`She'd planned for her complaint to be heard only by her cousins, but it had reached even Krauss's ears.`
`Scolded, Jessica scowled and turned away, sulking.`
`"......His condition can't be that bad, can it, with that kinda temper?`
` I mean, if they were saying he's not feeling well that'd be one thing, but if it's his mood that's bad, at least it's proof he's got some fight in him."`
`"Well, Grandfather does have especially strong willpower.`
` ...But, it doesn't mean that his body will always follow that.`
` Since last year, they keep saying that he has three months left."`
`"...If the initial diagnosis was correct, Grandfather has been prolonging his life by willpower alone.`
` ......We have to be concerned for him."`
`Lunch started with the family head's seat still empty.`
`...The man who should have been sitting there was already old,`
` and the brilliant glory which had rebuilt the Ushiromiya family in a single lifetime was slowly being forgotten.`
`Nobody seemed to feel uncomfortable when the meal began with that seat still empty...`
`The Ushiromiya family conference was held once every year.`
`{n}It took place on the first weekend of October.`
`If a normal family were to use a pretentious name like "family conference",`
` you'd expect it to be nothing more than a reunion of rarely seen relatives who greet each other surrounded by buckets of sushi.`
`However, in the Ushiromiya family, where the sons and siblings are lent great fortunes,`
` and only those that achieve success in business are considered adults, it literally was a conference.`
`How much of the fortune was invested? What kind of business was conducted? How much was earned?`
`As a result, how much of the fortune borrowed from the main family could be repaid?`
`{n}Or, alternatively, how much would be borrowed for future business ventures?`
`{n}What lessons had they learned, and what could they learn from their mistakes?`
`It seems that topics like these had been discussed very seriously in the past.`
`My dad called it a bed of nails.`
`Apparently, it used to be a very serious family meeting, where one would commonly be showered with harsh and angry voices, and even get slapped in the face despite being well past the age for it.`
`However, that was all a thing of the past.`
`By now, everyone had achieved success in their own independent business ventures,`
` and it was on the road to becoming a normal yearly get‐together.`
`Even so, being asked by Grandfather about the current state of play was an extremely stress‐inducing event,`
` and while to us grandchildren it was nothing more than a simple meeting, to our parents it was still a real stomachache.`
`The absence of the man responsible for all this, whatever the reason behind it, must surely have made today's lunch even more delicious.`
`The phrase "when the cat is away, the mice will play" comes to mind.`
`Well then, let me introduce Jessica's father, whose face I haven't seen for six years.`
`The man sitting to my dad's left is his older brother and the father of Jessica,`
` Uncle {p:0:蔵臼}.`
`......This name sure is easy to read.`
` Krauss ({p:0:蔵臼}).`
`...After so many weird names, it warps your sense of what's normal, and you start to think,`
` "hey, what's wrong with Krauss,`
` sounds pretty cool actually"...`
`Just like with Aunt Natsuhi, I don't have many memories of speaking with Uncle Krauss.`
`He had never been one to talk to children, and I felt like he was always talking with the adults, just like Aunt Natsuhi.`
`From the way my dad talked about him, it seems that he used to be a pretty spiteful and unreasonable person.`
`If what Dad said is true, he used to be very domineering as the oldest sibling,`
` and was hated by Auntie Eva, Auntie Rosa, and the rest of the family.`
`......Odd, considering they're all having fun chatting together.`
`Well, I guess even if their relationship was bad when they were children, sometimes when people grow up and go their separate ways, their relationship changes.`
`That's probably what this is.`
`After all, they all have children of about the same age.`
`Since they share similar family environments, they probably all profit by exchanging opinions.`
`Maybe because of that, the parents' circle has been deep in conversation for a while now about the exams Jessica and I are going to be taking.`
`Jessica, in order to escape the discussion of exams with the old bastard sitting on her left,`
` was purposefully facing to the right, firing off topic after topic so as not to give him an opening.`
`Moving on, let's look at the end opposite from Uncle Krauss and the others.`
`In the very last seat at the table, an old gentleman with a sturdy physique sat facing Kyrie‐san.`
` This was my first time meeting him.`
`I had only just been introduced to him, but it seems that he's Grandfather's personal doctor, a man called Nanjo ({p:0:南條}).`
`Apparently he used to own a huge clinic on the nearby Niijima island, but he turned it over to his son and then began living a life of leisure in his old age.`
`He's known Grandfather since the very beginning when the mansion was first constructed on this island, and they have a history going back several decades.`
`I thought he might be Grandfather's companion in his suspicious hobbies, but, surprisingly, it seems that he's Grandfather's chess partner.`
`......I see, that kind of hobby does seem very like our grandfather, with his love of Western style.`
`You could probably also call him the only person able to enter Rokkenjima who is neither a family member nor a servant.`
`From listening in on his conversation with the womenfolk seated near him, he gave the impression of a calm old gentleman.`
`......Considering he's managed to put up with our short‐tempered grandfather for so long, I'm sure his big heart is nothing to laugh at.`
`...Still, even if he is his doctor, having someone from outside the Ushiromiya family attending the family conference is a little odd.`
`From that fact, I imagine that Grandfather's condition has grown much worse,`
` and it may even be one of the major topics of discussion at the family conference...`
`George‐aniki was just saying it, too.`
`{n}For the past year, Grandfather has been continually pronounced as having very little time left to live.`
`...It's awful to talk about, but Grandfather is an extremely rich man.`
`{n}At the time of his death, his wealth will suddenly be released, along with our parents' stomach acid, surely leading to some serious ulcers.`
`With this kind of thing, the greater the number of ways it must be split, the more trouble will be caused splitting it.`
`...This kind of talk would probably also be included in the family conference.`
`{n}...Oh well, it's not like it has anything to do with us children.`
`......Finally, even though he's absent, let me introduce our Grandfather.`
`The person who should be sitting in that seat of honor is Ushiromiya Kinzo ({p:0:金蔵}).`
`...It really sucks.`
` He gave everyone else in the family these weird names, but he himself uses one which is conservative as all hell.`
`If only his name were written with those same characters for "gold" and "vault", but he let us call him "Goldsmith" or something,`
` that'd be totally awesome!`
`As you can probably gather from all the talk about him, he's a frightening person with an extremely short temper.`
`...Because I'm just his grandkid, and haven't met him since I was in elementary school six years ago,`
` I don't remember ever having been beaten by him, but it seems that our parents were raised with an iron fist.`
`That earlier conversation between my dad and Uncle Krauss,`
` about who should go try to convince Grandfather to come out, seems oddly funny if you take this into account.`
`In order to tell Grandfather's story, you have to take yourself all the way back to before the {ruby:1926–1989:Showa} era, to recount the tale of the Ushiromiya family.`
`Until the {ruby:1868–1912:Meiji} and {ruby:1912–1926:Taisho} eras, the Ushiromiya family was great and prosperous.`
`They owned several spinning mills, and were very wealthy people who merely had to fall about laughing while the money rolled in.`
`Incidentally, Grandfather, as a member of a branch family, originally had nothing to do with the main family.`
`Distantly separated from the head's inheritance, he apparently had very little involvement with the head house.`
`However, during the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923, the mansion owned by the Ushiromiya main family in Odawara was flattened.`
`The spinning mills in Tokyo were all burned down in a huge fire,`
` and the Ushiromiya family lost most of its wealth and family members in an instant.`
`It then became a matter of who would become the heir to the main family, and as it turned out, none were left except for Kinzo, who was as far removed from the main family line as they come.`
`Kinzo himself later said that it was such good luck, it was as though fate itself had been turned upside‐down.`
`With that, Grandfather's ordinary life did a 180.`
`{n}He was entrusted with reviving the wealth that the dying Ushiromiya family had almost completely lost.`
`Of course, just because you suddenly dump a task on someone doesn't mean they can do squat to accomplish it.`
`{n}I doubt the people around him were expecting much.`
`But this is where Grandfather began to display his extraordinary talent and good luck.`
`Grandfather used all of the family funds, and everything from the hair on his head to his toenails, as collateral to borrow a massive amount of money,`
` created a gigantic supply of funds, and immediately started a business.`
`It was like tumbling down a hill on a bike without any brakes.`
`And then, jumping onto a neighboring bike, and then another one!`
` Just like some crazy street performance.`
` Probably, anyone would have thought that Grandfather had no business ability.`
`But with an unbelievable amount of good luck and miracles, with coincidences piling up and every chance taken advantage of,`
` before anyone knew it, he had forged powerful connections with the Allied forces.`
`At that time, MacArthur and the GHQ were in charge of Japan.`
`Grandfather, in a twinkle of the eye, began succeeding in business under the protection of the occupying forces, quickly becoming very rich.`
`At this point, it was no longer luck but information that won the day.`
`He must have made some seriously thick connections with the occupying forces.`
`......Grandfather knew about the emergency demands that would be made for the Korean War, before they happened.`
`No, more than that, he must have foreseen these special procurements and started penetrating those markets from the very beginning.`
`History textbooks say that all of Japan made a large profit off the emergency demands for the Korean War, but that wasn't the case in reality.`
`Only a very limited number of the super‐rich played the money game and made an easy profit.`
`Most of the citizens remained poor.`
`{n}......In other words, Grandfather was an extremely lucky member of this group of winners.`
`This all happened...during the year {ruby:Showa 25:1950}, I think?`
`{n}And since the year of the Great Kanto Earthquake was {ruby:Taisho 12:1923}...`
`......that means Grandfather was able to revive the near‐dead Ushiromiya family, to a level even higher than it had been before, in the span of only twenty to thirty years.`
`With that, you'd think that he would revive the main family in Odawara,`
` but for some reason, he went and did something as crazy as buying an entire small island in the Izu Archipelago.`
`Buying an entire island is not something that you can ordinarily do today.`
`However, Grandfather was clever.`
`{n}He contacted the GHQ and applied for the establishment of a marine resource base.`
`He acquired this island as a business property, and then reneged on it and claimed it as his own plot of land.`
`After the war there were prevention measures against food shortages, and, furthermore, he had the sponsorship of the GHQ, which meant that nobody could oppose him.`
`It seems that Tokyo provided the land for next to no money at the time.`
`Tokyo later made repeated complaints for the land to be returned, but not much could be done due to the involvement of the GHQ, even though they'd been pushed into it.`
`No doubt he'd bribed everyone there was to bribe.`
`{n}In the end, the city gave up in frustration.`
`Grandfather, with considerable skill and blessed with good luck, managed to weather the stormy seas of that period,`
` obtaining a vast fortune and his own island.`
`Of course, it wasn't all luck.`
`{n}He was skilled with English, and this was cultivated by his Western obsession.`
`{n}It was by using that as a weapon that he was able to make inroads into the GHQ.`
`A mansion was immediately built on the island.`
` That would be this mansion.`
`Grandfather, who had always loved the West, made this once uninhabited island, Rokkenjima, a canvas upon which he could realize his dreams to his heart's content.`
`The Western mansion that he had always imagined, overflowing with emotion; the beautiful garden where various roses had been planted.`
`And a private beach where nobody other than himself would ever be permitted to leave a footprint.`
`......To have this much would be every man's dream.`
`After that, making good use of his huge fortune,`
` he became a large stock holder in the extremely stable iron and steel industry, and was able to live an easy and comfortable life just using the dividends.`
`Well, he's just that incredible.`
`This kind of person normally gets portrayed after the fact as having the ability to foresee and predict the future or something,`
` but Grandfather denies all of that,`
` repeatedly saying that he was simply blessed with extraordinary luck...`
`......Anyway, even a lord like that, with all of his dreams made real,`
` can't help but grow increasingly odd when locked up alone on an island.`
`Everyone knows he's been obsessed with the West for a very long time,`
` ...but none of our parents really knows when his bizarre black magic hobby began.`
`Perhaps his love of black magic began way back when he became fascinated with the West,`
` or, possibly, his miraculous stretch of good luck which allowed him to revive the family caused him to feel a mysterious power in himself.`
`...At some point, Grandfather began to make the research of black magic his life's work,`
` filling his study up with suspicious books, chemicals, and magical items as he became increasingly bizarre.`
`These being the few remaining years of a person successful in life, those around him "warmly" watched over him, feeling the time was his to spend as he pleased...or so I hear, but...`
`.........No way in hell that's true.`
` They probably were just driven away, thinking "that's disturbing, I don't want to get involved".`
`Well, ...that war‐torn period was a time for big gambles, with both opportunities and risks.`
`I'd like to see Grandfather do so well if he'd been born in this time period.`
`He would've had no opportunities, and would probably have advanced like a chess piece from mandatory education to college at a leisurely pace,`
` never becoming more than an average company employee.`
`If that had happened, he'd probably be sitting here with the rest of us, regaling us with tales of his shitty boss.`
`No, no—not here, in the dining hall of a mansion—we might have been around a table at some bar.`
`If that were the case, I'm sure that this would have been a more comfortable family conference.`
`Alright, that's enough talk about the old geezer who won't pop off.`
`{n}More importantly, let's talk about this incre~dible lunch!!`
`"I was already sold by the sashimi salad!`
` Gohda‐san is one hell of a chef!`
` Plus, these fish were caught in the oceans near here, weren't they?`
` The sashimi you get at the supermarket don't even come close!"`
`"Hey, quit it, Battler.`
` Your upbringing will be exposed."`
`Everyone let out a big laugh.`
`Damn it, you say that even though you love those cheap pubs.`
`"Hahahaha.`
` My job occasionally leads me to eat at some quite interesting places, but even compared to those, this is an excellent dish.`
` I imagine you could have become reasonably well‐known in that field, Gohda‐san."`
`"I don't know too much about it, but...`
`at the famous hotel where he used to work, employee politics got pretty complicated and everyone split into factions.`
` In the middle of all that, he was apparently forced to retire.`
` And, it just so happened that Mom had job offers for a servant out at the same time."`
`As Gohda cleared away the empty plates, he began to recount his own eventful past, never losing his smile.`
`"......The world is a difficult place.`
` However, it is thanks to this that I was given a chance to display my skills as a chef once again, this time for the Ushiromiya family."`
`"Although I also enjoy the smiles of a larger number of people,`
` it is also extremely entertaining to be able to perform delicate work in order to please solely the limited number of people I have pledged to serve.`
` All of this is thanks to the opportunity given to me by Madam."`
`Gohda‐san respectfully bowed his head towards Aunt Natsuhi.`
`"That is because among all of the applicants, you were the most talented.`
` The decision was not based on personal feelings, but purely objective, so there is no need to thank me."`
`...Oh man, why does Aunt Natsuhi always have to speak so frankly.`
`If only she spoke more gently, she might give off a different impression.`
`Shannon‐chan and Kumasawa‐san entered from the hallway with a serving cart.`
`"......Please excuse us."`
`"Now then, let us move on to today's dessert."`
`Gohda‐san and the others laid out the beautifully adorned dessert.`
`I guess it's true when they say you have another stomach for desserts...`
`I'd thought that being fed all that delicious food had totally filled me up,`
` but as soon as I laid eyes on the dessert, my stomach started yelling "More!"`
`I don't know much about desserts, but this looked really good.`
`A white pudding‐like substance was garnished with two shades of red sauce,`
` and elegant rose petals adorned the dish.`
`When you dine on such magnificent food as this, first it is distributed in front of everybody, and then the chef takes a moment to extol the virtues of his creation.`
` Until he has finished, as a rule, you don't touch the food.`
`However, Maria, who had no experience with these ceremonious rules, got excited by this beautiful and delicious‐looking dessert and jumped into the fray as soon as it was placed before her.`
`Auntie Rosa scolded her, calling it bad manners, but George responded by saying "Now, now, it's alright."`
`"Uu?!`
` This one's sour!`
` This one's sour!`
` Battler, the wrong one is this one!`
` Uu!"`
`Maria exclaimed as she sampled the two colored sauces.`
`"What, there's a right one and a wrong one?! Alright, I'll give it a go~!`
` Mmmmm?!"`
`Apparently the two sauces were one sweet and one sour.`
`{n}Despite it being bad manners, I also stuck my little finger in and licked it.`
`Whoa, one of them was sour enough to make you pucker up.`
`{n}If it were yellow, I'd have suspected lemon, but I couldn't guess what kind of sourness would be red.`
`I decided to ask Shannon, who was putting away the serving cart behind us.`
`"Shannon‐chan, what kind of sauce is this sour stuff?"`
`"......Umm......`
`............err...`
`......u..."`
`Shannon‐chan hesitated to speak.`
`Maybe she was just setting the table and doesn't really know.`
`{n}She's hesitating a bit much for that, though.`
`{n}......Did I ask something wrong?`
`Or did they use something that we'd be better off not knowing about?`
`While Aunt Natsuhi acted as though she had a headache, Kumasawa‐san, who was setting the other side of the table, began to laugh with a "hoh‐hoh‐ho".`
`"What do you think we made it out of?`
` Hoh‐hoh‐ho, it'll shock you..."`
`"Huh? ...I, I don't have a clue.`
` And, Kumasawa baa‐san, that laugh creeps me the hell out.`
` So, what is it?!"`
`"......Don't tell anyone, alright?`
` Let me borrow your ears."`
`Kumasawa‐san leaned across from the other side of the table.`
` She'd asked to borrow my ears, so I leaned forward too.`
` Their interest caught, Jessica, George‐aniki, and, of course, Maria, also put their ears closer.`
`"Uu.`
` What?`
` Whaat?`
` Tell mee!`
` Tell mee!"`
`"The sour part is, well...`
` ......Actually, it's squeezed juice from a mackerel, hoh‐hoh‐ho!"`
`"""WHAT, mackerel?!?!"""`
`"Don't be ridiculous," we all thought, horrified.`
`{n}Only Maria accepted it, nodding with an "uh‐huh".`
`"Uu?`
` Mackerels are sour.`
` If you squeeze them, this comes out!"`
`""...ha, wahahahahaha...!""`
`When Maria started clamoring that mackerel were sour, the adults were unable to contain their laughter.`
`"You've got it wrong, that's vinegared mackerel!"`
`Auntie Rosa said to Maria in a small voice while turning red.`
`Ahhhh, now I remember it perfectly.`
`{n}Kumasawa‐san was always this kind of a character, wasn't she?`
`{n}I think I remember her tricking me about all kinds of things when I was young as well!`
`Amongst all of them, the most painful must have been that one!`
`{n}That flimsy black stuff you get in Chinese food!`
` Kikurage mushrooms!`
`{n}She told me it was penguin meat and I went all around school like a smartass telling everyone, didn't I?!`
`"Kumasawa baa‐chan, you sure haven't changed...!`
` You know Maria's gonna believe now, right?"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, it's just a joke!`
` Gohda‐san will tell you what the sauce is in just a moment!"`
`Gohda‐san looked a little put out from having his masterpiece laughed at in such a strange way,`
` but after clearing his throat once, he introduced the dessert to us.`
`"Well then, allow me to describe tonight's dessert.`
` Based on the rose garden that everyone seemed to enjoy so much today, I finished this panna cotta in a rose garden style.`
` The rose petals scattered across were selected just now from that rose garden."`
`"For the sauces, I have prepared two different reds for you, strawberry and rose hip.`
` Please enjoy the strawberry's sweetness and the rose hip's sourness in turn.`
` Finally, the rose petals are merely decoration, so please set them aside before eating.`
` With that said, please, enjoy."`
`......Hahhh... ...Man, I almost want to applaud before I've even eaten it.`
`It's like when you take medicine, you know, how it seems to work better when you've read the instructions.`
`Thanks to Gohda‐san elaborating on the details of this dessert, I feel like he's knocked it up another notch.`
`Seriously, should you call him meticulous or just talented?`
`The dessert was probably planned from the beginning, but he took a cue from our stopping in front of the rose garden earlier today,`
` and displayed an incredibly timely awareness of the season by just adding a few rose petals from that garden.`
`This combination of sweet and sour was also exquisite.`
`{n}If it was just sweet, you'd just get used to it and become bored halfway through.`
`But by bringing in the sour sauce at that point, you get a really vivid taste.`
` And then, once you return to the sweet sauce, all of the sourness in your mouth is replaced with an enjoyable sweetness again.`
`I'm sure everyone else felt the same way.`
`Every time Gohda‐san passed by one of the seats, someone praised the taste and his creation.`
`"How is it, Madam?"`
`"Splendid, as always.`
` It is a worthy treat for our guests."`
`"I am most grateful for your words.`
` ......Madam, did you know?`
` I have heard that rose hip has the ability to cure headaches.`
` I thought that you especially would appreciate it, so I had it specially prepared."`
`"...Is that so?`
` Thank you."`
`"See, didn't I tell you, Natsuhi nee‐san?`
` Rose hip works on headaches."`
`"So it seems.`
` ...I can only hope it has some effect."`
`"Haahh!`
` Gohda‐san, I love ya!`
` Hey, later, whisper me how much compensation you're gettin' for this, won't ya?!`
` If you're sworn to silence, you can stick up some fingers instead, let me know your price!"`
`"Havin' your talent monopolized by this small island is sacrilege to humanity's cookin' culture!`
` Wouldn't you be willin' to display your talent to all the customers at my company?"`
`"Hahaha, Hideyoshi‐san.`
` Are you trying to recruit our Gohda?`
` How troubling.`
` We had better make some improvements to his salary, or he'll get snatched away."`
`"*giggle* Yes, you really should.`
` If you don't, he'll be lured away and you'll be stuck with three meals a day of Kumasawa‐style mackerel cooking, won't you?"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, that is indeed harsh.`
` It seems someone's holding a grudge."`
`"""Wahahahahaha!!!"""`
`Everyone let out a huge laugh.`
`According to Jessica, Kumasawa‐san's "mackerel jokes" were a type of running gag,`
` and our parents had long since gotten used to it.`
`Kumasawa‐san often claimed that mackerel contained precious nutrients that could do things such as prevent aging and make people smarter.`
`...It seemed that while it couldn't stop the outward signs of aging, it helped prevent aging on the inside.`
`Since she was still healthy enough to tell these kinds of jokes at her age, that benefit must be the real thing.`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` Well then, if you'll excuse me.`
` Prepare yourself for tonight's dinner!`
` I'll be cooking plenty of mackerel dishes for you to eat, so look forward to it!"`
`"Wahahaha, we sure will.`
` I want to treat myself to some vinegared mackerel tonight!"`
`"That sounds wonderful.`
` I wonder if any delicious Japanese sake will be included."`
`"Oh, it certainly will!`
` How about some of our famous Rokkenjima mackerel liquor..."`
`"""Wahahahahaha!!!"""`
`Kumasawa‐san, together with Shannon‐chan, bowed and pushed the serving cart away.`
`Amusingly, Gohda‐san, who looked just as though his stock had been stolen from him, explained very seriously that tonight's dinner would actually be calf steak.`
`"......Umm...`
`.........Kumasawa‐san, ...thank you for doing that back there..."`
`As she pushed the serving cart, Shannon bowed her head very deeply.`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, I haven't done a~nything that requires thanks."`
`Kumasawa played dumb, but it was no accident that she had thrown Shannon a lifeline.`
`Back when Battler had asked for the details of the dessert, Shannon had unfortunately hesitated.`
`There may have been several ways to dodge the question, but all of them should have been delivered deftly.`
`Shannon, who hesitated when hard pressed for a response, was always suffering because of this small weakness.`
`If only Shannon, like Gohda, had a little of the craftiness needed to skillfully shake off a mistake, her days would be a little more comfortable.`
`...This weakness was especially unfortunate considering how flawlessly she could handle her work.`
`Of course, there were those who well understood Shannon's meek nature and her inability to remember to gloss over her mistakes.`
`...Which is why Kumasawa came to her aid without hesitation.`
`"I just heard from Genji‐san that there's been a change to the afternoon shifts.`
` I believe you were given a break until this evening.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐ho, I am jealous."`
`"Huh, ...ah, I'm sorry—I haven't checked the list of shifts yet."`
`"Ah, yes.`
` I was thinking I might start cooking some mackerel in the oven.`
` If you don't mind, I would be happy if you would help out a bit before your break."`
`"Ah, yes...!`
` I would be delighted to help."`
`To Shannon, Kumasawa was like a mother among the servants.`
`The dining hall needed to be cleaned up, so we were chased out.`
`{n}Instead, tea would be served in the parlor.`
`It seemed that they would be preparing the black tea that Auntie Rosa had bought for Aunt Natsuhi.`
`Maria insisted that she also wanted to drink the black tea, but was rejected by the old bastard, who told her and the rest of us kids to go play outside.`
`"Battler‐kun, why don't we all go for a walk outside?"`
`"Go look at the roses or something.`
` But keep a close eye on the weather.`
` The sky's still clear, but the weather report kept on talkin' about rain."`
`"Uu!`
` I want the beach, want the beach!!"`
`"Ah, isn't that a wonderful idea!`
` Playing on a sandy beach isn't something that you get to do often, is it?"`
`"I guess not.`
` Alright, let's all go to the sandy beach then!"`
`"Uu! Let's go, let's go!"`
`"Maria, be careful not to get your clothes wet.`
` Your shoes, too."`
`"Uu!`
` Won't get wet!"`
`"*giggle*, so obedient and cu~te.`
` Battler‐kun, make sure you keep an eye out for Maria‐chan, okay?"`
`"Sure thing, leave it to me!"`
`"Ohh? You're pretty cute and obedient too when Kyrie asks you something, huh?`
` ...Why don't you try listening to me obediently for a change?"`
`"Heh!`
` Hell no!`
` Let's go everyone, c'mon!"`
`The children flew out of the parlor.`
`They were replaced by Genji, who pushed a serving cart in and prepared the black tea.`
`The parlor was filled with a sublime aroma which entertained everyone while they waited to appease their thirst...`
`"Hahahahaha...`
` Rudolf, you and your family all seem to get along so well with each other.`
` Good for you."`
`"Oh, please—you have us beat on that front."`
`"So true.`
` Jessica‐chan really has grown into an innocent little thing, hasn't she?`
` It's all the fruit of your training, isn't it, Natsuhi nee‐san?"`
`".........Thank you."`
`Natsuhi answered coldly.`
`...With that, the conversation halted, and the parlor became silent.`
`Possibly because he couldn't stand it anymore, Hideyoshi broke the silence while performing an exaggerated gesture.`
`"Still, they sure do grow fast.`
` ...I thought they'd be kids forever, but they've been gettin' huge right before my eyes, and before I knew it, they've joined the ranks of us adults.`
` Battler‐kun, for one, is beyond recognition!"`
`"His body has gotten much bigger, but he is still a child.`
` Well, my husband is still a child as well."`
`"...I wonder where the border between child and adult is.`
` I still don't feel as though I've grown up."`
`"Hmph, isn't that pitiful.`
` That's not something the mother of a child should say."`
`"That's right.`
` We're not children anymore.`
` We are all adults.`
` So I would like it if we could all hold an intellectual discussion without becoming emotional."`
`When Eva smiled with sharp sarcasm, everything seemed to get more tense.`
`...It felt like the smell of the tea that had been prepared so carefully just flew out the window.`
`"We have always strived to hold intellectual discussions.`
` ......Your sarcasm is ill‐placed sometimes.`
` You've never changed in that respect."`
`"...‘Always strived’, is it?`
` My, my.`
` I wish I could wrap those words up and send them to this room a few decades ago.`
` Right, Rosa?"`
`".................."`
`Rosa smiled with a vague expression.`
`{n}...Whether she agreed or disagreed, she knew that she would earn the displeasure of either her brother or her sister.`
`It was a bit of worldly wisdom she had needed to learn as the youngest sibling.`
`"Quit it, Aneki.`
` We should enter into the main topic while the brats aren't around, right?`
` Let us make that our intellectual discussion."`
`As Rudolf glanced over the faces of all present, some let out a slight sigh and some let a small look of resignation cross their face.`
`......This was the unavoidable...`
`true agenda.`
`"Last year, his life expectancy was estimated at about three months.`
` Which means he's already at minus nine.`
` The Grim Reaper could come flying through the window in a blind panic at any moment."`
`".........The family head is still in good health.`
` Raising such an inappropriate topic while the sun is still bright...I must question whether you are in your right mind, Rudolf‐san."`
`"Still, Natsuhi‐san.`
` ...If we don't discuss this until somethin' happens, it'll be too late.`
` He's still healthy now, so we've gotta figure out something while we still have some time left over.`
` It's a kind of financial etiquette."`
`"It seems as though everyone is concerned about Father.`
` ...Doctor Nanjo.`
` Could we hear the details from you?`
` It seems as though they are also hoping for that."`
`".....................*cough*."`
`Nanjo, standing by the window and staring out at the rose garden, let out a single cough when he realized that he was being called.`
`"......Doctor Nanjo.`
` ...How is Father's condition?"`
`"Well, first...`
` My estimate last year that he had only three months to live still appears to be making its presence felt, so allow me to start by correcting it."`
`"No need to explain.`
` You're saying that measuring remaining life is only a prediction, not a promise, right?"`
`"...That is correct.`
` Because of that, I can offer no definitive answer to the question you all so often ask me, of when he will pass away.`
` A human's life is supported by their body and their mind.`
` ...If the body is weak, the situation becomes more dangerous, but if the mind is strong enough to compensate for that weakness, it is possible to maintain a state of remission."`
`"So you're saying that even if his body is weak, his mind is still firm and spirited."`
`".........Kyrie, sorry, but please stay quiet for a while."`
`"......Sorry."`
`"That is correct.`
` Kinzo‐san's body has been ravaged by disease.`
` With him continuing to partake of that kind of strong liquor on top of all that, I really must think..."`
`"So booze is the reason he's teetering on the edge.`
` And booze is also the reason he's hanging on.`
` Sounds like Dad, the heavy drinker."`
`"Well then, Doctor, I know you can't give anything more than a prediction...`
`......but what do you think about Father's chances of living until this day next year...?"`
`"That is quite the rude question to ask about the head."`
`Natsuhi jumped on Eva, unable to hide her astonished expression.`
`In response, Eva returned a defiant look, but Hideyoshi noticed and tried to smooth things over with a forced smile.`
`"Ah, Natsuhi‐san, forgive her!`
` Eva, try and choose your words a bit more carefully, okay?"`
`"I'm sorry.`
` I was just so concerned over Father's condition.`
` *giggle*."`
`"............Is that so?`
` I hadn't realized."`
`"Doctor Nanjo, please tell us.`
` For the sake of the beautiful family love of a daughter worried about her father's lifespan."`
`Krauss laughed sarcastically, and Eva, smiling sweetly, returned an identical chuckle.`
`"...You ask whether he will still be healthy next year,`
` ......but it is a very difficult question for me as a doctor.`
` While I do think this remission will last for a while yet,`
` if he suffers some kind of fit, there may be nothing we can do."`
`"......After all, Rokkenjima is a solitary island.`
` It is not as though an ambulance can come rushing in to save him.`
` Normally, I would want to have him hospitalized in a large hospital on the mainland, but..."`
`"Father stated that he does not want his noble research interrupted.`
` ......It seems he holds a grudge over the way we tried to force him out last year.`
` Apparently, he strongly suspects that he'll be shut away in some hospital if he goes outside.`
` And that's how things are now."`
`"Has Doctor Nanjo been examining him?"`
`"Father trusts Doctor Nanjo.`
` ...It seems he can be examined when in a good mood."`
`"......I can examine his condition, but if I try to recommend medicine or hospitalization, he refuses to listen.`
` ......I've really only been able to look."`
`"It's true that there are people that hate doctors...`
` Still, what a hassle!"`
`Nanjo sighed deeply.`
`{n}The purpose of an examination was to determine what medical treatment was appropriate.`
`Receiving an examination and then not following the advice given made the whole thing pointless...`
`"Then, in summary,`
` his expected life is still three months,`
` and there's no way to guess how long he will continue to live while still on the verge of death."`
`".........Rudolf‐san.`
` Couldn't you be more discreet with your words?"`
`"Ah, sorry.`
` I've always talked this way.`
` Cut me a break."`
`"I understand Doctor Nanjo's opinion.`
` ......What do you think, Krauss nii‐san?"`
`"......Hmph.`
` To be perfectly honest, I have to disagree with Doctor Nanjo.`
` I find it truly difficult to think of Father as a person so sick that he has only three months to live.`
` His yell is as healthy as ever, and I still get the chills at the thought of his fists raining down on me.`
` ......Pushing the task of caring for Dad solely on the shoulders of the eldest son is far from fair."`
`"Hahhaha.`
` In the next world, be born after me."`
`".........Alright, let's return to our discussion.`
` In that case, according to the impartial and neutral doctor's opinion, it wouldn't be odd for him to go any time.`
` Sorry, Aniki, but I'd rather trust the opinion of a specialist.`
` With that, I believe the discussion of Dad's fortune is no longer a premature topic."`
`"Father's personal funds probably reach into the tens of billions of yen, right?`
` But, it's not as though all of that is neatly gathered as ready cash.`
` It's not as simple as neatly cutting a birthday cake with a knife."`
`"...Interesting metaphor, Aneki.`
` That's right, sometimes strawberries or chocolates are placed on top of the cake, making it hard to cleanly divide it into equal parts.`
` Taking that into consideration, I think it's important to first discuss how best to stick the knife in, don't you...?"`
`"I truly don't understand you all. Even while the head is still alive, you're discussing the matter in loud voices as though he were already dead."`
`"Come now, don't you see how important this is?`
` After all, when the time comes, the inheritance of his fortune must be carried out immediately, right?`
` Moreover, the wealth of the glorious Ushiromiya house is vast.`
` Don't you understand that a careful discussion is necessary beforehand?`
` There's a huge difference between the assets of this family and your old one."`
`"......How rude.`
` The family I was born to has nothing to do with this."`
`As Natsuhi resentfully responded in a low voice, the already dark atmosphere grew even more hostile...`
`"Give it a rest, Eva...`
` Natsuhi‐san, forgive us!`
` Pardon her rudeness."`
`Hideyoshi tried to smooth things over by glancing at both with a forced smile, but it only resulted in making the hostility between Eva and Natsuhi even more intense...`
`"............It seems that I will just be in the way if I stay any longer.`
` Please excuse me."`
`Nanjo rose from his seat and exited the parlor.`
`......This may well have been a normal act of courtesy expected of an outsider, but even so, his back was watched by several glances envious of his ability to escape.`
`After the doctor had exited and his footsteps had disappeared into the distance, Krauss recrossed his legs.`
`"So let me see if I understand your point of view correctly.`
` ......Father's remaining life is short.`
` You want to quickly enter into a practical conference concerning the distribution of the inheritance.`
` ......Why are you so eager, I wonder?"`
`"Certainly, as you say, estimating and distributing the Ushiromiya family's wealth is no simple task.`
` In that case, shouldn't we carefully and deliberately calculate?`
` It seems to me that you are all impatient to split up the cake tonight.`
` That's true, isn't it, Rosa?`
` Is something making you impatient?"`
`"...............It's not that we're impatient.`
` ...But a decision between the siblings is essential.`
` It doesn't matter when,`
` but if Father's condition is worsening, and the day is drawing near,`
` discussing the matter beforehand...isn't what I would call impatience..."`
`Rosa sneaked a glance at Eva and Rudolf.`
`{n}...As the youngest daughter in the family, being cross‐examined by the eldest was harsh.`
`".........Hoh.`
` Is that your true opinion?`
` I didn't expect that the most honest and pure‐hearted of the siblings would say something like that.`
` I wonder if those two told you to say that...?"`
`"........................"`
`"Quit it, Aniki.`
` Rosa is a sibling just like the rest of us.`
` She has a fair right to Dad's inheritance.`
` It's obvious she would be interested, right?`
` ...After all, Dad will definitely die, and that's not something that'll happen in the distant future."`
`"......On the contrary, Aniki, you are far too relaxed.`
` It seems almost as though you would like nothing better than to turn the discussion away from the distribution of the inheritance."`
`".........What do you mean by that?`
` Are you trying to accuse my husband of something?"`
`"Calm down, Natsuhi‐san.`
` Listen to what we have to say..."`
`"Nii‐san, I hear these are very good times nowadays.`
` That's right, since last year the yen has just been going up and up thanks to the unprecedented boom in prosperity.`
` It seems that it's no longer a dream that the dollar will reach 100 yen."`
`"Also, the ruling party says that it will establish a health resort maintenance law by next year.`
` At this moment, resort development companies across Japan are running about trying to gather as much capital as they can."`
`"......You know your stuff.`
` Soon, Japan will see an unprecedented boom.`
` Just like when Father revived the Ushiromiya family—another case like the Korean war demands."`
`"......The people of Japan have worked at a frenzied pace, realized vast economic growth, and become the most prosperous people in the world; they are enjoying the height of their prosperity.`
` Private spending has increased, and institutions that can profit from that can make easy money in this era."`
`"The people's needs are no longer merely the essential three electrical appliances.`
` Places to ski, to golf, public pools.`
` Resort hotels and theme parks!"`
`"Have you gone to Delsney Land, which opened just a few years ago?`
` What an excellent theme park that is!`
` In that place, even an adult can be a kid and have fun with his family."`
`"The old era, where the only virtue was to selflessly devote yourself to your country while failing to consider your family, is ending.`
` Now, as the most prosperous people in the world, we can finally accept that."`
`"Krauss nii‐san, your foresight is somethin' else.`
` ...When I heard this several years ago, I thought it was ridiculous.`
` ......But see, when I heard about the G5 nations' Plaza Accord, that changed."`
`"The yen's gettin' stronger and stronger, and the price of land will skyrocket soon, I bet.`
` The day that Japan becomes the economic center of the world isn't far off.`
` ......You have a very forward looking view.`
` There's no mistakin' that at least."`
`"I feel the same as Hideyoshi nii‐san.`
` Aniki, you can read into the next decade of history.`
` That keen sense surely came from Dad.`
` It's incredible."`
`"......However, unlike Dad, there have been cases where the timing of your predictions has been mistaken, haven't there?"`
`"Nii‐san, believing that Japan will definitely face an economic boom, you have been launching resort projects everywhere, and almost all of them continue to fail.`
` ...While I'm sure that the era you predicted is arriving, it seems that you misread the timing of that boom."`
`"......You were too early.`
` And then you hurriedly tried to sell everything off, and as a result opened the wound even further.`
` ...If your nose was really so reliable and you predicted the coming of a boom, then there should be no reason for you to sell off your property.`
` Isn't this proof that you don't trust your own ability?"`
`"......How rude!`
` Are you trying to insult my husband?"`
`Natsuhi's forehead creased as she rose from the sofa.`
`Eva, paying this no heed, stared at Krauss with a confident smile.`
`...Krauss, who also maintained his confident appearance, told Natsuhi to sit down.`
`"Please stop, Natsuhi.`
` My little sister is incapable of speaking any other way and always has been.`
` ...Calm yourself a little.`
` Your headache will get worse."`
`"Proof that you have no talent is also right here.`
` ............After all, Nii‐san, weren't you all excited about turning this island into a resort?`
` Building a wonderful resort hotel, beautifully maintaining the garden.`
` I'm just an amateur and don't pretend to understand, but you must have used a significant amount of money, right?"`
`"What are you trying to say?!`
` My husband's business has nothing to do with you!"`
`"Actually, that's not true, Natsuhi‐san.`
` Rokkenjima is not Aniki's.`
` It is Dad's.`
` The hotel that was constructed is Aniki's, of course.`
` If you like, you can charge us lodging fees tonight.`
` Right, Rosa?"`
`"...............Well, hmm.`
` ...If what I have on hand will suffice."`
`"If I can make it into a resort, this island's financial worth will rise.`
` It is true that expenses have piled up, but we can hope to have a large harvest in the future.`
` When that happens, it should prove to be beneficial to all of you as well."`
`"I understand that.`
` If the value of this island rises, that will increase our shares when we distribute the inheritance.`
` Of course, we won't ask you to physically divide the island and the mansion into four equal parts.`
` We're quite happy to settle this with whatever you calculate its financial worth to be."`
`"If you understand that much, what about my business makes you so dissatisfied?"`
`"We aren't dissatisfied, we're uneasy.`
` In the first place, Aniki,`
` when do you plan to open that hotel?`
` Keep this up, and every square inch of it will be covered in our grubby hand prints!"`
`"That's right.`
` It's an important tool for your business, isn't it?`
` I understand that you can't keep it locked up until the moment you open it for business.`
` Buildings go bad if you don't use them and air them out every once in a while."`
`"Even so, it's a bit extravagant for a guesthouse that we only use once a year.`
` Wouldn't you say, Rosa?"`
`"..................That's right.`
` If it's that wonderful, I'm sure that it will become quite popular once you open it."`
`"Oh...`
`.........the hotel you mentioned earlier was referring to the guesthouse, I see..."`
`"Hell of a building, isn't it?`
` Just as Rosa said, I'm sure it would become popular if he were to open it."`
`The lodging they had been guided to had not been constructed with the intent of building a guesthouse.`
`...It was originally constructed as a resort hotel.`
`{n}However, even though it had been completed two years ago, there was absolutely no schedule for it to be opened...`
`"Nii‐san, it's just like all of your enterprises.`
` Your attention and planning are both fabulous.`
` Then, it always becomes unable to maintain itself partway, and ends without being able to collect any profit."`
`"It was brilliant of you to spot that it was a waste to use this island only as a place to live.`
` I think that turning it into a resort which could use things like marine sports, fishing, or honeymoons to attract customers was a pretty good plan."`
`"If I were the oldest son, I'm sure I too would have racked my brains over what kind of profit I could get out of this island."`
`"But, two full years have passed since you finished building, right?`
` After two years, you still don't know when you'll be able to open it?`
` Where is the managing company you entrusted it to?"`
`"......Impertinence!`
` That is not my husband's fault!`
` There has just been some trouble with the company that my husband contracted with—no matter how you look at it, we are victims here!"`
`"That's the thing, though...`
` This company that Krauss nii‐san hired...`
`I haven't heard many good rumors about it, y'know?"`
`"Let's not beat around the bush.`
` ......The project disintegrated mid‐way due to nonpayment, embezzlement, and other troubles—did you think the rumors wouldn't reach our ears?`
` I've been collecting evidence."`
`"I don't know what kind of evidence you found, but it's all baseless!`
` As new members in the sightseeing business, it is necessary to lay the groundwork with various people.`
` It is also important to discuss how trustworthy the other party is.`
` This is nothing more than taking some time to meet that end!"`
`"......I'll accept that, in my rashness, the hotel was completed too early.`
` However, we are not paying maintenance costs.`
` It's a slow and vital strategic arrangement."`
`"Yeah, I bet.`
` More like you want to sell it but can't.`
` There's no reason for anyone to buy such an extravagant hotel on an isolated island with nothing on it and no established sightseeing routes.`
` Besides, what's happening with the loans you gathered for this project?"`
`"It might not be costing you maintenance, but the borrowed money you can't return is just goin' up and up.`
` ......Sorry, Krauss nii‐san.`
` I investigated the development plan for this island a little.`
` ...I gotta be honest, I've not heard anythin' good either."`
`"Hideyoshi‐san.`
` I'm sure that only looking at the current financial condition could lead you to that impression.`
` However, that is a prior investment.`
` I have no choice but to admit that my prediction was mistaken, and that up until now, several liabilities have been created."`
`"However, the times have finally caught up with me.`
` I will soon regain everything that I have lost up to this point.`
` No, actually, all of the investments I have made until now will finally return to my possession.`
` That's right, just like throwing away a small fry which then becomes a salmon, they will come back even bigger than before."`
`"Sure, I'm with you on that.`
` Startin' soon, the resort business will probably see an unprecedented boom...`
` Though who knows whether it'll be enough to bury all of your liabilities..."`
`".........But I gotta ask, Krauss nii‐san.`
` After all the crushing defeats you've suffered so far, who in the world supplied you with the funds?`
` That's a heck of a sum we're talkin'.`
` Enough to cover your massive debt, right?"`
`"......What are you trying to say, Hideyoshi‐san?"`
`"Ahh, Natsuhi‐san, please, don't get mad!`
` We've done our research, see.`
` ...We looked into it, tryin' to see who could've loaned Krauss nii‐san, who's lost all his battles thus far, enough to support his recent massively gutsy investments."`
`"...And the result—`
`no one.`
` There is no backer.`
` The iron rule of the money roulette is to bet against the unfortunate.`
` And Aniki, you are a well known unfortunate in this neighborhood."`
`"Surely this era seems set to welcome an economic boom, but when we asked who, with respect to Aniki's failures,`
` would find him worthy of funding,`
` there was no one."`
`"So you see...`
` Where did you raise that money from?`
` ...That's what we started to question next."`
`".........Hoh.`
` Isn't this an interesting story.`
` And?"`
`"D‐dear!`
` How long do you plan to ignore these abusive remarks!!"`
`"Sit down, Natsuhi‐san.`
` .........Let me be blunt.`
` Aniki, you have been diverting Dad's private funds for your own business.`
` There is almost no doubt.`
` If we made some mistake, please, feel free to explain it for us."`
`"Rudolf, this isn't diverting funds.`
` This is embezzlement, isn't it?`
` It's a genuine crime that can be criminally prosecuted."`
`"Th‐this is rudeness in the extreme!!`
` How can you even face the successor to the Ushiromiya head house and level these wild accusations!!"`
`"They aren't wild, they're right on the money, aren't they?`
` He wants to make his business succeed so that he can recover his losses, but his debt is actually growing!`
` All he wants is to get himself out of the hole he's dug, by making an even bigger gamble than before.`
` If he had funds close at hand, it's only logical that he'd try to use them!"`
`"Let me say it clearly, Nii‐san—what you are doing is embezzlement.`
` You are betraying our father.`
` I imagine that we will leave you to the mercy of the courts after this is all over.`
` Do you think those people will kindly agree to address you as "successor to the Ushiromiya head house"?"`
`"O‐of all the things...sa‐saying that he's betraying the head is not something I can overlook!!`
` You no longer have the right to darken the doors of the glorious Ushiromiya house!!`
` Leave this place immediately!!`
` Go on!!`
` Get out!!"`
`Natsuhi, who had already reached the limits of her anger, shouted at Eva in a rage.`
`She then pointed alternately at Eva and the hallway, indicating that she should leave.`
`Eva took out a folding fan and fanned herself with it, glaring maliciously at Natsuhi as though silently daring her to repeat what she'd said.`
`However, her mouth was still smiling, curved in the shape of a crescent moon.`
`...In that unpleasant silence, Rosa gulped.`
`"Hey, ...Natsuhi nee‐san?`
` Who do you think you are speaking to?"`
`"I am speaking to the extremely impolite sister of my husband!!`
` As the person in charge of family affairs, I cannot overlook any more of this!!"`
`"In charge of family affaaairs?`
` Huhuhu,`
` hahahaha,`
` ahhahahahaha!!"`
`"Shut up,`
` you sorry excuse for a wife!"`
`Eva folded the fan with a snap and rose powerfully.`
`Compared to the elegance and playful behavior she had shown until just now, she was unimaginably aggressive.`
`"How foolish. {i:You} leave!!`
` You would tell me—Ushiromiya Eva!—`
`me, Eva, the third‐ranked in the Ushiromiya family hierarchy, who is granted the left shoulder of the head, to {i:leave}?!"`
`"Learn your place!!`
` And then look in a mirror at your shabby figure!!`
` Where on your clothes is the wing?`
` Where are you permitted to wear the One‐winged Eagle?"`
`"Your only purpose was to birth a successor to the Ushiromiya family!!`
` Know your place, bitch!!"`
`While Eva's face grimaced unattractively, her words pierced Natsuhi's heart like claws, and painfully twisted in.`
`"..............................!!!"`
`......There were a hundred ways Natsuhi wanted to respond.`
`{n}However, her anger and sorrow crushed her throat, and not one of them managed to make it to her mouth.`
`...The anger which had lost any place to go became a single hot tear which slowly dripped down...`
`"Whaaat?`
` If you have something to say, please, say it now.`
` Come on."`
`Eva faced her with a provocative gaze.`
`......However, Natsuhi's fist was shaking; she trembled all over, unable to do anything...`
`Krauss quietly broke that powder‐keg tension.`
`"Natsuhi.`
` Leave your seat.`
` You should cool off your head."`
`"Wh—!!"`
`Natsuhi, resenting the fact that her husband had not come to her aid, shifted the focus of her attack.`
`"D‐...don't you understand what they're saying about you?!`
` These people are baselessly calling you a traitor to Father!!"`
`"We protect the glory of the Ushiromiya family,`
` we put forth effort day in day out, striving to be paragons of nobility in order to take over that glory from Father, and this inexcusable rambling tramples it all underfoot!!!"`
`"And you―why don't you talk back to them?!`
` I'm talking back because you won't, but you have just been relying completely on me...!!`
` And now you are telling me to go cool my head?!`
` It's {i:always} me!!"`
`"I am always thinking so seriously about this family's affairs, and you've just taken that and...!!`
` UuuUUUuuu, uuuuuuuuuhuhughh!!!"`
`Natsuhi could no longer hide her tears.`
`{n}She flew from the room in that state.`
`After that, all that remained was a somewhat embarrassed mood about the parlor...`
`When the sound of footsteps grew distant and silence returned, Krauss shrugged his shoulders slightly.`
`"......I apologize for my wife.`
` She has always been bad at controlling her emotions.`
` I too have a hard time with her."`
`"If you've got someone like that running things, you must be on edge constantly as well!`
` *giggle*giggle*...!"`
`"Uuuuu...`
` UuuuuUUUuuUUughhu!!!"`
`"......Ma‐......Madam......"`
`"It's nothing...!`
` Leave me be...!!"`
`Natsuhi flew into her room...and bent over the bed, wailing.`
`Those heartwrenching sobs reached Kumasawa in the hallway...`
`......How heartrending, Madam Natsuhi...`
`There is a deep enmity between her and Eva‐sama.`
`...Explaining their relationship is very draining for a woman such as myself...`
`The Ushiromiya family holds its bloodline in high regard, but if a daughter marries into another family, they would normally be removed from the family hierarchy.`
`......So, under normal circumstances, Eva‐sama should have been removed when she married Hideyoshi‐sama.`
`However,`
` ...and this was not anyone's fault.`
`Madam definitely bore no guilt.`
`There's no way to say it other than calling it a whim of God.`
`...Krauss‐sama and Natsuhi‐sama were not blessed with children for some time.`
`And of course, this was the patriarchal Ushiromiya family.`
`A wife was just a tool to create an heir.`
`......If that wife could not fulfill her only duty, she would not be treated as human.`
`It is painful to remember how much the Master tortured Madam during that time...`
`During that time, Eva‐sama and Hideyoshi‐sama's wedding was discussed.`
`......Eva‐sama was sly.`
`...Taking advantage of Madam's inability to become pregnant, she gained the favor of the Master.`
`She inspired him to allow her to marry and give birth to a successor herself, making sure to avoid transferring her name out of the Ushiromiya register.`
`There was a vast difference in the Ushiromiya hierarchy between Madam, who married into the Ushiromiya family and was treated like an outsider, and Eva‐sama, who was related to the family by blood and whose husband took on the Ushiromiya name.`
`And beyond that, Eva‐sama was the first to give birth, and what's more, to a boy...`
`Perhaps you can now understand how much weaker Madam's position was compared to Eva‐sama's...`
`...I'm sure Madam is tormented by the thought that if only she had gotten pregnant earlier, the Master wouldn't have accepted Eva‐sama's request to keep her last name after marriage, and Eva‐sama wouldn't have been permitted to act as arrogantly as she had today...`
`However...that was not Madam's fault......`
`All of the blame lies with God's whims, and the stork that delivered Jessica‐san late......`
`Even so, Madam won't allow herself to see things this way...`
`......She probably can't help but cry bitter tears at her inability to carry out the duties expected of a wife...`
`Ahh, how heartrending...`
`I cannot do anything but watch over her from the shadows......`
`We crossed the hall again on our way to the entrance.`
`As we did, we once again saw that witch's portrait.`
`However, the word "saw" is probably not the best word to describe that experience.`
`{n}......It was more like our eyes were drawn to it.`
`That woman's eyes, with their sage‐like glamour, definitely had the power to make those who looked at her stand rooted to the spot.`
`"............So this is the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......Wonder if it's true."`
`"Uu?`
` Battler doesn't believe...?"`
`Back when he had asked what this picture was, the first person to tell him it was {f:5:Beatrice} had been Maria.`
`Therefore, when Battler showed signs of doubt, Maria must have felt that Battler didn't have faith in her.`
`...Of course, that's not what Battler meant.`
`Maria ran up to the portrait and began banging on a plate below it.`
`Maybe the title of the portrait was written there.`
`Maria, trying to prove that she wasn't lying, obstinately continued to hit the plate.`
`"Ahh―sorry about that,`
` it's not like I doubt anything you said, Maria."`
`"Uu!`
` Battler believes!`
` Uu!"`
`When he patted Maria's head and apologized, she seemed to accept it, sticking out her chest and proudly "uu‐uu"ing.`
`"...............Let's see here.`
` "My beloved witch, {f:5:Beatrice}".`
` .........Behold the sweetfish river...`
`...wait.........what's with this weird, long epitaph?"`
`The plate did have the title of the portrait written on it, but it was much too big to contain only that.`
`Beneath the title, what looked like a long epitaph was also written.`
`As I skimmed over it, I was taken aback by the array of unnerving words that jumped out at me.`
`"Incredible, isn't it?`
` Grandfather had that written.`
` ...Pretty deep, huh?"`
`"Uu!`
` I know!`
` It's the place where the gold is hidden!"`
`"......Wait, is it that story about the Ushiromiya family's hidden gold?`
` There's another thing that takes me back...`
` ......Wait, Aniki, ...is that for real?"`
`"Grandfather had this written, but he refuses to say anything about this picture or the epitaph.`
` .........Even so, amongst the family, it is often whispered that it points to the location of Grandfather's hidden gold,`
` and that he will relinquish the family headship and the gold to the person who solves the riddle."`
`"Uu!`
` I heard that too, I heard that too!`
` Lots and lots of gold!"`
`"...Well, who knows, really.`
` Ten tons of gold bars.`
` Sounds a bit too fishy to me."`
`"Still, if you read this all the way through, it almost seems real."`
`.........I think I already explained Grandfather's upbringing,`
` but let me also mention the Ushiromiya family's "Legend of the Gold".`
`Grandfather succeeded the Ushiromiya family after it had been almost totally destroyed in the Great Kanto Earthquake,`
` and by successfully riding the stormy seas after the war, managed to accumulate great wealth.`
`...That much of the story everyone knows.`
`{n}However, this is where the strange part of the story begins.`
`...Part of it is closely tied to Grandfather's black magic hobby, so its credibility is extremely low, but......`
`......Well, wait until the end before you doubt or make fun of it.`
`After the war, Grandfather successfully predicted what the future would hold, his big gamble paid off, and he accumulated a vast store of wealth,`
` ......but there is a mysterious legend about how he gained the funds in the first place.`
`Grandfather came from a branch family and had no connections in the business world or the financial world.`
` Even though he later built connections with the occupying forces, in the beginning he was supposedly a nameless person who had not yet gained anyone's trust.`
`Money can only be gathered based on trust.`
`{n}There's no way anyone would lend money to an untrustworthy person.`
`......How did Grandfather, whose trustworthiness was zero, manage to obtain the large amount of funds in the first place?`
`......It is said that, when asked that question, Grandfather answered like this:`
`{i:One fateful day, I encountered the Golden Witch }{f:7:Beatrice}{i:.}`
`He then went on and on about how he continued to research alchemy and techniques for summoning demons in order to become a great mage.`
`...And the entity summoned as the result of the demon‐calling ritual was the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`He then said that he made a contract where, in exchange for his own soul, he would receive fortune and honor.`
`The witch then granted Grandfather ten tons of gold.`
`Grandfather used this gold as collateral to prepare a vast quantity of funds,`
` and then used that to multiply his wealth by several times and revive the Ushiromiya family...`
`It seems that this story is so old that our parents had already been told it when they were still children.`
`So, our parents, when they were little,`
` explored this island in various ways, believing that the gold that Grandfather had received from the witch might be hidden somewhere.`
`However, since there was the danger of them getting lost in the abandoned forest,`
` Grandmother or someone began to spread the story that the witch lived in the forest and approaching it was too dangerous...`
`"......I remember that old story.`
` When we were little, our parents told us about it and we went all over the island searching for treasure.`
` .........Didn't we get lost in the forest and start crying until some of the servants found us? Our parents were so mad at us.`
` ...That takes me back."`
`"We sure were idiots, weren't we?`
` I mean, come on, Grandfather used that to build up the funds that he finally bought this island with, right?`
` That means he must have had the gold before coming here.`
` There's no way it'd be here on the island."`
`"......That's not necessarily so.`
` Maybe the gold was hidden on the island from the beginning and he bought the whole island just to make sure it was all his.`
` There was a whole ten tons of it, right?`
` It seems more realistic that he would try to secure the place where it was hidden rather than try to move it all."`
`"This epitaph was written two years ago.`
` And since Grandfather had it written himself...`
` ......I see, this does make the Legend of the Gold more believable."`
`"Ten tons of gold, bestowed upon Grandfather by a witch, that it's said he used to revive the Ushiromiya family.`
` ......It's sleeping somewhere even now, and Grandfather may be planning to turn it over to whoever can solve his riddle."`
`".........Hahh, I guess that sounds like Grandfather's style or something......`
` Ihihi!`
` If it's true, that's one hell of an opportunity."`
`The epitaph carved into the plate was very mysterious, something like a poem or a song.`
`Its sentences were incredibly disturbing, filled with the signs of Grandfather's black magic hobby, and truly in bad taste,`
` but it could definitely be viewed as a puzzle which, if solved, could lead to the place where the gold was hidden.`
`"I can't even imagine if that's what he intended or not.`
` ......All I can say is, this shady epitaph was displayed here so that everyone in the family could see it."`
`"And that, even while hinting at the existence of the gold, he still refuses to touch upon the subject of its hiding place.`
` .........That caused our parents' imaginations to run wild, and call it a battle of wits from Grandfather..."`
`"...Bet it's my dad who's taking this nonsense at face value, his greed exposed to the world.`
` Even though he laughs at Grandfather's black magic hobby, he'll still believe this story about the hidden gold.`
` He's all talk."`
`"......Well, it's certainly not a realistic story.`
` At that time, when Grandfather was still nameless without any connections, there's no way anyone would have just lent him a massive quantity of gold bars for free.`
` ......Although, it's not unthinkable to suggest that's exactly why Grandfather called his sponsor a witch."`
`"Yeah, but, it's ten tons, ten tons!`
` If you traded that for money, how much would that come to?`
` Anyway, it'd have to be a ridiculous amount, right?!"`
`".........It would be a ridiculous amount.`
` They say that the total amount of gold mined by humankind since the dawn of history is at most 100,000 tons.`
` That one ten‐thousandth of all of the gold humankind has obtained throughout history should belong to just one person is just insane."`
`"...And that it should all be in one place, and that there should be a "witch" who could just lend it to Grandfather as if it was nothing.`
` ......That would be no ordinary person."`
`"As for me, I think that that number "ten tons" sounds totally fake.`
` In the first place, has anyone other than Grandfather ever even seen it?`
` And even if some generous witch lent him some actual gold, couldn't that "ten" be right but actually be mistaken from ten kilos?`
` Even ten kilos would be a pretty incredible sum, right?"`
`"Uu.`
` ...Ten kilos of gold is how much?"`
`Maria, who couldn't keep up and felt like she was being spoken to in riddles, finally found a place where she could ask us a question.`
`A question which I also wanted to ask right then.`
`Whether I hear ten kilos or ten tons, I know that it's an incredible amount, but I couldn't put a number on exactly how incredible.`
`George‐aniki folded his arms and tried to remember the market price of gold.`
`".........Well.`
` Gold is affected by speculation, and its price can also change depending on its purity and the trustworthiness of the foundry.`
` You would also need to pay a commission to turn it into money.`
` Still, it is definitely a precious metal, and some people estimate that if gold mining continues at its current rate, within half a century, we will have mined all of it."`
`"............Just guessing haphazardly,`
` ......for one kilo, I think maybe a price of 2 million yen."`
`"Whoa...`
` .........I know I just plucked that ten kilos figure out of thin air...`
` ...But even that would be worth 20 million yen!"`
`"Uu?`
` I weigh 28 kg."`
`".........Which means that if we had Maria‐chan's weight in gold,`
` we could estimate its worth at over 50 million yen."`
`"That's just mind‐boggling...`
` How much would ten tons be then?`
` It's 20 million for ten kilos, times a thousand, so......umm.`
` .........That's it!`
` 20 billion yen?!`
` What the hell!"`
`How much is 20 billion yen actually worth?`
` ......We would have to measure it by putting it in terms we could understand.`
`I mean, they say that wages over a lifetime are 200 million yen.`
`...You grow up and work like crazy, sacrificing your life for your company, and as you approach old age are finally freed.`
`{n}And all that together, including the retirement money, comes out at 200 million yen.`
`...In other words, that is the cash equivalent of a human's life—`
`no, you could even call it the price of a life.`
`...We were talking about a sum so enormous that it would require a hundred of those lives.`
`......Assuming you work for 40 years from age 20 to age 60,`
` ......then it's equal to 4000 years of work wages.`
`It's a sum of money you could finally accumulate after working every day starting from the Jomon period.`
`"...Uu.`
` Is 20 billion yen huge...?"`
`"Yeah, it's huge.`
` Maria, you could buy more of that shortcake you love than you could eat in a lifetime."`
`"......However, while I could imagine 20 billion yen in cash,`
` I don't think it's very plausible for it to all be in one place as gold bars."`
`"Just as I said, gold is extremely heavy, and it is not very convenient as a method for storing all your accumulated fortune.`
` If it was all in highly valued stocks and bonds, or really expensive precious gems, it wouldn't be unthinkable."`
`"...You often hear of people who, in the chaotic period of the war, traded their wealth for precious gems so that they could carry it around with them.`
` ......But you don't usually hear stories of people exchanging their wealth for gold."`
`"Of course it's heavy, but internationally it's the most trusted and stable—doesn't that mean something?`
` With bonds, for example, if the country is destroyed they're just scraps of paper."`
`"You can also look at it that way.`
` ...But even one ten‐kilo ingot is pretty heavy to carry around.`
` Have you ever heard this?`
` Even if you can carry a 50‐kilogram person on your back, you can't carry a 50‐kilogram bag over your shoulder.`
` With that many gold bars, the amount of labor and risk for one person would be hard to calculate."`
`"So what you're saying is, if we were talking 20 billion yen in banknotes lying around, that'd be one thing,`
` but given that it's supposedly 20 billion yen in gold piled up, it doesn't really ring true."`
`"That's right.`
` ...Although the Legend of the Gold does have a pretty interesting ring to it, even just the part about the ten tons of gold is a little bit of a stretch..."`
`"If you think about it logically like that, it sounds obviously fake.`
` Haha, kind of brings you back down to reality."`
`"That said, it is Grandfather we're talking about, after all.`
` He may have announced his financing from some kind rich person in an exaggerated metaphorical way, as ten tons of gold received from a witch.`
` Even the number "ten tons" feels pretty symbolic."`
`"You mean like his gratitude for the money he borrowed was worth ten tons of gold, or something?"`
`"Hehehe, maybe some rich man's leisured wife generously granted it to Grandfather.`
` And maybe then he started calling this lady a witch?"`
`Hmm, Jessica's example isn't bad.`
`...If someone was generous enough to lend a huge sum of money to Grandfather when his trustworthiness was still zero,`
` she would certainly be someone worthy of being called a witch.`
`......Furthermore, Grandfather later used that money to build a vast amount of wealth.`
`...With such an incredible ability to judge people,`
` again, she might well be fittingly called a witch.`
`Also, since she went to the trouble of lending all that money, she might also have enthusiastically guided how it was spent.`
`Come to think of it, the idea to get involved with the occupying forces and profit from the Korean War demands might have come from the witch as well.`
`With all that considered, saying that he "received wealth and honor from a witch"...`
`might actually be a fair description.`
`"I see.`
` ............So, in other words, this witch granted the funds necessary to revive the Ushiromiya family, and Grandfather owed her big time.`
` ...If that's the case, and Grandfather had that huge painting drawn and displayed out of feelings of gratitude...yeah, that might not be that strange a story."`
`"Hey, what if this person looked like an old witch‐like granny?`
` And then Grandfather idealized her appearance and turned her into this beauty when he had the painting drawn.`
` Hahahahaha, I'll bet if we ever did meet this person, she wouldn't be nearly this pretty!"`
`"Hahahaha, that's possible.`
` The name {f:5:Beatrice} sounds pretty Western, and if you think about how everyone in our family has Western‐style names,`
` maybe even the name {f:5:Beatrice} is the result of Grandfather trying to rearrange some Japanese person's name to make it sound Western."`
`"I get it, I get it.`
` That means that this pretty girl doesn't exist outside the picture.`
` Guess that means I won't be able to rub those el~egant breasts, ihihi!`
` In the first place, isn't a witch a little weird?`
` Like you could find something like that anywhere on earth."`
`As I laughed and made fun of the witch in an attempt to differentiate myself from the kid I was six years ago who was afraid of the witch of the forest, Maria tugged on my sleeve.`
`...The strength with which she did so displayed a little annoyance.`
`"Hmm?`
` What is it, Maria?"`
`"Uu!`
` Uu!!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} exiiiists!"`
`Maria stared up at me.`
`{n}...She had on her usual sour look, but I could tell she was angry because of the color of her eyes.`
`"Witches exist!`
` Witches exist!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`"Well sure, they do exist...if you turn the TV on and watch anime or something."`
`"Exiiist!!`
` Witches exiiist!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`I started to feel pressured, not knowing why Maria was jumping on me like this.`
`Then, Jessica tapped me on the shoulder and told me in a small voice.`
`"...Dumbass, don't go smashing a kid's dream.`
` Maria really believes that things like witches and {f:5:Beatrice} exist."`
`"Come to think of it, Maria‐chan, in social studies at your school, when you were asked to write what you wanted to be when you grew up, you wrote "a witch", didn't you?"`
`Maria nodded seriously.`
`{n}Tears started to run from the corners of her eyes.`
`.........I see. To a girl who wants to become a witch in the future,`
` this "{f:5:Beatrice}" is proof that witches do exist in this world,`
` and is also someone who she admires and strives to be like.`
`"Exiiist!`
` Exiiist!`
` Witches exiiist!!`
` But Battler doesn't believe!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`"It's alright. They exist, witches.`
` Onii‐chan believes it."`
`George‐aniki kneeled down and held Maria's head.`
`{n}...Watching this, Jessica poked me in the side.`
`...So that's what it is.`
`It's basically like, I just dropped the bomb that Santa Claus doesn't exist,`
` in front of a child who believes in him, on Christmas Eve.`
`...I'm not the kind of guy who likes to shatter kids' dreams.`
`".........Uhh, I'm sorry.`
` I wasn't trying to make fun of your dreams. I apologize.`
` Of course {f:5:Beatrice} exists.`
` Even now she's living in the forest, and comes every night to the mansion to peek in and see what everyone's doing."`
`"......That's why you shouldn't go into the forest.`
` And at night, you mustn't stay up staring into the dark forest.`
` ......You might be seen by the witch of the forest, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ............After all, Grandmother said so."`
`"...Uu......`
` Really?`
` ...Battler really believes?"`
`"Yep, I believe.`
` Sorry for doubting it.`
` ...C'mon, let's make up, okay?"`
`I stuck out my hand and Maria grabbed it with her tiny hand, and we made up.`
`Maria didn't grumble any more than that, so George‐aniki and Jessica were relieved.`
`"......Oh.`
` This is where all of you were?`
` I was sure you had just left to go to the beach..."`
`Shannon‐chan, carrying a basket, was surprised to find us all gathered in front of the portrait.`
`"Ah, Shannon.`
` Well, this is the first time Battler has seen {f:5:Beatrice}'s portrait.`
` He was just fascinated by it."`
`"Yes, she does that, doesn't she?`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is truly beautiful.`
` I am sure that she captivated the Master."`
`"Ahahahaha.`
` In addition to the patron theory, there's also a theory that she was Grandfather's first love.`
` ...Either way, although it's been several decades since he met her, even now she holds a special place in his heart.`
` ...Which must mean that he is still captivated by her even today."`
`"Sheesh.`
` That must have made Grandmother pretty jealous, right?"`
`"I don't know everything, but yeah, that did happen, actually.`
` Apparently Grandmother believed that he was cheating on her with some blonde‐haired woman."`
`"......Uu?`
` Good smell!`
` Good smell coming from Shannon!"`
`Maria, sniffing, approached the basket Shannon‐chan was holding with interest.`
`Now that you mention it, I do notice a fragrant scent with the essence of vanilla.`
`"Ah, I apologize.`
` I was told by Kumasawa‐san to bring them to you all."`
`"What is it, I wonder?`
` ......Ooh, excellent!`
` Cookies."`
`"Uu!`
` Want to eat cookies!`
` Want to eat cookies!`
` Uu!"`
`"Certainly, you may eat as many as you would like.`
` ...But, umm..."`
`Unsure whether it was really acceptable to serve cookies in a place like this in front of the portrait,`
` Shannon‐chan sent us a glance which seemed to ask what we wanted to do.`
`...Well, thinking about it, yeah, that would be bad manners.`
`"Maria, why don't we eat someplace else?`
` Let's put the cookies in a bento and have a picnic."`
`"Uu!`
` Have a picnic, have a picnic!!`
` If we can eat cookies, let's go!"`
`"Yeah, let's go get some fresh air.`
` We shouldn't pick at food right in front of the witch."`
`"Oh, right, didn't we say that we wanted to go down to the beach in the first place?`
` Let's go, let's go."`
`"Shannon‐chan.`
` Sorry, but could I ask you to get us a blanket to sit on and some flasks of tea."`
`"Right...!`
` Certainly."`
`Shannon‐chan received her instructions and gracefully bowed before retracing her steps.`
`We headed for the beach on our own.`
`Everyone headed for the entrance in a group.`
`...Feeling as though that witch was staring down at our backs, I turned around once more.`
`"...Uu.`
` ......Battler, you still don't believe...?"`
`"Oh, no, I believe.`
` ......That way is more fantastical!`
` The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} gave Grandfather ten tons of gold!"`
`"And that gold might be sleeping around somewhere.`
` Plus, they're saying Grandfather wrote that strange epitaph as though challenging us to find it if we can.`
` I think that kind of romantic story is way better."`
`"20 billion yen's worth of goollld!`
` Hehe, even if we split it up between the four of us, that's still a ridiculous amount of money!"`
`"5 billion yen for each of us...`
` ...Incredible!`
` With that kind of money, any business would prosper.`
` No, wait, we could live our whole lives fabulously without ever working at all."`
`"Uu‐uu!`
` Not 5 billion yen, cookies, cookies!!"`
`"Wahahaha, Maria would take cookies over money.`
` Still, 5 billion yen, that's like a dream!"`
`"Ridiculous.`
` ......Is it truly possible that you all believe in Father's Legend of the Gold?"`
`"............The story about a witch who gave him the gold and so forth, we obviously don't believe.`
` However, there's no mistake about the gold."`
`"Multiple sources have confirmed the fact that Father was in possession of gold bars from an unknown source.`
` We heard that, before the Marusoo company president died, Father showed him a large amount of gold somewhere.`
` Father stated clearly to him that there were ten tons' worth."`
`"That's just the nonsense of a senile old man.`
` Along with Father, he was just fabricating a story.`
` You can't take it seriously."`
`"If that gold didn't exist, he wouldn't have been able to gather so much funding...!`
` Before the president died, he was a person whose sincere personality gathered a lot of respect from many in the business world.`
` He wouldn't have become a partner to such a fraud...!"`
`"Aniki.`
` The president of Marusoo definitely saw it.`
` Ten tons of it, clearly with his own eyes.`
` Even more, Dad let the president take one ingot at random and have it examined."`
`"......The results of the examination showed that the ten‐kilogram ingot had a purity of {ruby:99.99%:four nines}.`
` He said that the Ushiromiya family crest, the One‐winged Eagle, was carved into it."`
`"Almost instantly, the Ushiromiya Legend of the Gold spread amongst the fixers of the business world.`
` Gold from an unknown foundry has a poor rate of conversion into money.`
` Thinking that it was a chance for decisive profits, they accepted it as collateral, and as a result Father was able to receive a giant loan..."`
`"This is the most ridiculous nonsense I've ever heard.`
` ...How old are you people?`
` Are you still taking that fairy tale you heard as a kid at face value?"`
`"Where is the proof that this "ten tons of gold" even exists?`
` Isn't it just the lies of Father and those who were closest to him?"`
`"......Of course it's just a story.`
` But still, Aniki.`
` The amount of money that Dad raised required a suitable quantity of collateral.`
` Even if the gold was just a rumor, that he must have shown them a treasure of comparable worth is an unmistakable truth, don't you think?"`
`"It was just a fiction of gold created by our penniless father.`
` He made it seem that non‐existent gold actually existed and fooled his sponsors.`
` It was probably the gamble of a lifetime."`
`"......Fortunately, his use of those funds proved successful.`
` If the Korean war demands hadn't come and the Ushiromiya family had not been restored, Father would probably have been hounded after as the crook of the century."`
`"In that case, are you saying that the gold never existed, ...and that Father made it all up?"`
`"Of course.`
` Therefore, after he had become sufficiently successful, the fiction of the gold was nothing but an inconvenience.`
` So Father made up that absurd story about the witch and black magic and made the whole thing seem less believable."`
`"In other words, he revealed that the gold was a complete fiction.`
` If he says that he received the gold from a witch, no one would believe that it exists at all, right?"`
`"He may even have said it for all of your sakes.`
` Nevertheless, some stupid offspring wanting to divide up this non‐existent gold with the rest of the inheritance have appeared.`
` ......Rosa, don't tell me that even you believe this kind of a fabrication...?"`
`".....................I can't prove whether or not Father really has the gold."`
`"......However, as one of father's four children, I just want to claim my rightful share."`
`"Hoh...`
` It seems even Rosa has learned to assert herself.`
` Alright, maybe this is what you all want to say:`
` that I am trying to keep all of the gold to myself..."`
`"Nii‐san, the fact is that you've obtained a massive amount of funding.`
` If we rule out the possibility that you have been embezzling Father's personal funds,`
` ......then there's only one possibility left, right?"`
`"......Aniki, maybe you have already found the ten tons of gold bars.`
` It sure looks that way to us."`
`"Ridiculous.`
` Something like that never existed in the first place."`
`"Then explain yourself.`
` Embezzlement of Father's assets; Father's hidden gold.`
` How could you have gathered so much funding if you didn't use one of these?"`
`"I also have many friends in the political world and the financial world.`
` I have done nothing more than gain their assistance.`
` ......And as for that, I have no responsibility to explain it to you.`
` You understand, don't you?`
` There are some topics that can't be talked about."`
`"......If that's the story you insist on, then fine.`
` But Aniki. Dad doesn't have long.`
` Nobody can ensure that he will live to see this day next year."`
`"When Dad dies, the inheritance will be passed on immediately.`
` We will all set up impartial lawyers and accountants to inspect the state of Dad's finances."`
`"If, at that time, the fact that our brother has unjustly interfered with Father's money comes to light...`
` ......You understand, right?"`
`"I don't have a clue what you're talking about.`
` You're starting to make me feel as indignant as my wife was."`
`"...Father's gold is definitely one of Father's assets!`
` I understand it's money you can't reveal openly.`
` Even so, the four siblings should have an equal right to it."`
`"In short, we will also have your financial situation investigated to determine whether or not you are hoarding the gold."`
`"You have a good opportunity right now.`
` Prove the existence of this backup from friends and acquaintances that you mentioned.`
` That way you will be spotless.`
` And we can sportingly apologize for foolishly doubting you.`
` Right, Rosa?"`
`"......That's right.`
` Krauss nii‐san, you are the one who's avoiding the topic.`
` If you were guiltless, you could just prove that you were in the right, yet you aren't even trying to respond."`
`"However, Aniki, we still have to consider your position here.`
` As Dad's representative, you're probably bearing a larger share of the burden than we are.`
` It wouldn't be fair for the rest of us, who have been living terribly relaxed lives until now, to complain without taking that into account."`
`"............Hoh.`
` I am spoken ill of one moment and flattered the next; it is quite tiring.`
` Please get to the point."`
`"In short, ......randomly investigating nit‐picky aspects of Father's wealth seems a pretty darn boorish way to do it.`
` As you said, Krauss nii‐san, you've probably got movements of money that are difficult to explain.`
` We understand that, and that's why we've come to consult with you.`
` ...A mutually beneficial consultation."`
`"Consultation?`
` Hoh."`
`"......When the inheritance is distributed, you will be rewarded for your years of hard work taking care of Dad by an agreement that is generous in your favor."`
`"Don't misunderstand us.`
` It's not like we're saying that we will abandon our rights.`
` It's just that when we claim what we deserve,`
` it wouldn't be bad if there was a generous understanding of your position—that's what we mean."`
`"In other words, if you'll accept our conditions,`
` at the time of the division of the inheritance, we won't mind leavin' the investigation of Father's financial status to you, Krauss nii‐san."`
`All of the siblings from Eva downward suspected that Krauss was trying to steal their father's wealth.`
`In that situation, letting Krauss report on the state of their father's wealth by himself was extremely contradictory and a huge concession.`
`If, as they claimed, Krauss was actually embezzling money, Krauss would be able to hide that fact.`
`Besides that, it would also be possible for him to control the distribution of the inheritance in a manner favorable to himself.`
`Krauss, also realizing that this sounded too good to be true, couldn't help but feel doubt.`
`He had to worry about what they would ask in return for such a compromise...`
`"......Hoh.`
` After mistrusting me completely, you now say that you're willing to restore your confidence in me as the eldest sibling?`
` And what are you asking for?"`
`"Just what we deserve as siblings.`
` ......You aren't the kind of person who would steal Dad's property.`
` However, there is no patron financing you.`
` ...Considering all that, there is a certain explanation that would satisfy the rest of us."`
`"......Nii‐san, you found the ten tons of gold,`
` and used that as collateral to gather some funding.`
` ...Yes, just like Father did in the past, right?"`
`"If that's the case, there won't be any funny bits in Father's finances.`
` You've always been a good son, lookin' after Father.`
` Why would we mistrust a person like that?"`
`".........You're being so roundabout I can barely understand you.`
` Say it more clearly and specifically."`
`"Our first condition:`
` Aniki, you must admit that you have found Dad's gold."`
`"...Are you asking me to admit that I possess gold that does not exist?"`
`"Our second condition:`
` recognize our rights to a share of the gold, and pay it to us."`
`"How foolish.`
` With the nonexistent 20 billion yen of gold, that would be 5 billion yen per person. Are you telling me to pay a total of 15 billion yen?`
` ......Preposterous!"`
`"Keep listening until the end!`
` We know that much money can't just appear out of nowhere.`
` We're not askin' you to make an impossible deal!`
` Of course, regardin' the portions of the gold, we plan to reward you sufficiently for your hard work until now in our calculations."`
`"Our third condition:`
` the portion of the gold to the one bearing the title of successor to the Ushiromiya main family will be 50%. The remainder will be split fairly between all the siblings.`
` Of course, this also includes you, Krauss nii‐san."`
`"Of the 20 billion, 12.5 billion will go to Aniki,`
` 2.5 billion will go to Eva nee‐san,`
` 2.5 billion will go to me,`
` and 2.5 will go to Rosa."`
`"............A distribution that makes me so grateful I could cry.`
` So you're saying, for the sake of the gold that doesn't exist, I must pay you 7.5 billion."`
`"What's wrong?`
` Nii‐san, your share is five times the size of ours.`
` That's such a good condition, I'd be jumping for joy.`
` Heheheheh..."`
`"Our fourth condition:`
` the dividends will be paid out along with the distribution of the inheritance at the time of Dad's death.`
` However, as a deposit, 10% of our portions will be paid to us promptly.`
` The payment must be made before March of next year."`
`"......What do you think, Krauss nii‐san? This is an ideal chance for you to restore the trust you need to run Father's assets, isn't it?!`
` Of course, it might be impossible to get a whole 7.5 billion before Father dies.`
` However, you can't say that you couldn't manage a deposit of 750 mil, right?"`
`"Paying 700 million in half a year might be slightly bothersome,`
` but someone like you, who has many friends in the political and business spheres, should be able to manage it."`
`"Normally, I'd hope to receive the 7.5 billion right now, all at once.`
` But out of concern for your position, if you'll just show your sincerity by delivering 10 percent for the time being,`
` it's alright to let the remaining 90 percent carry over until the distribution of the inheritance.`
` ...Right?`
` Surely even you can offer a mere ten percent to show your sincerity?"`
`"............So the right to investigate the status of Father's assets is being sold to me for 750 million.`
` .........Heh, heheheh.`
` Isn't that great?`
` You all sure have grown.`
` I never thought you all would become capable of offering a deal to me."`
`"Nii‐san, if you accept these, the rest of us siblings will leave the investigation of Father's assets to you.`
` However, the results of that investigation will be subject to appeal."`
`"...It's only natural, right?`
` We'd be sad if you adjusted our portions downwards by 7.5 billion."`
`"As a general rule, we wouldn't complain.`
` As long as you do it neatly, it's fine.`
` ...As long as you don't do anything significantly obvious, we don't plan to aggravate anything.`
` We want the inheritance quickly as much as you do.`
` We don't want it to get all drawn out and led astray."`
`"......In the case of an appeal, who would do the second investigation?"`
`"...............That can be you as well.`
` This will probably be the first and last opportunity for us siblings to discuss this.`
` ...I trust you not to let it come to that."`
`"Heheh, *cackle*cackle*!`
` Rosa, you really can talk sometimes."`
`That Krauss was not trusted whatsover as the oldest sibling was by now so obvious that it requires no explanation.`
`The formerly tyrannical oldest brother would always abuse his privileges and infringe upon the other siblings' shares.`
`...In response to that, the other three, now adults, were for the first time striking back at him by working together...`
`"I'm sorry, but there are further conditions.`
` Our fifth condition:`
` this decision must take precedence over Father's will.`
` .........Later on, we don't want some will to appear and make this decision completely useless."`
`".........I see that you're very cautious.`
` ...Then let me ask, if the gold really were found, what would you do?"`
`"As long as you've settled this matter with the corresponding payment,`
` then whether the gold`
` "really"`
` appears or not makes no difference to us.`
` ...You can think of our share as an advance payment."`
`"*giggle*, gives you something to live for!`
` You plan to turn this island into a resort, right?`
` During construction, you might stumble upon the gold by chance."`
`Eva let out a high‐pitched laugh.`
`{n}Krauss watched without even flinching.`
`"......Let me add a seventh condition before I accept.`
` In the situation that any sibling other than myself finds the gold, they will immediately turn it over to me."`
`"Yes, yes, of course, we'll guarantee you that.`
` *giggle*!"`
`Insignificant details.`
` The others, who were forcing Krauss to pay money for some nonexistent gold,`
` would of course not ensure Krauss's portion if they actually found the gold.`
`From the beginning, this deal had been nothing more than a threat directed at Krauss.`
`While the truth might be different, the probability that Krauss was embezzling his father's assets was extremely high.`
`When at last Kinzo faced death and it came time for the inheritance to be distributed, surely some unpleasant facts would come to light.`
`That situation would likely be a fatal wound to Krauss.`
`They had latched onto that weak point, and were threatening their brother under the veil of compromise, trying to wring out a huge sum of money.`
`......However, they had let one thing slip their minds.`
`{n}The three of them had forgotten that their oldest sibling, who they couldn't defeat unless they banded together, was a very nimble thinker when it came to being crafty.`
`Krauss relaxedly let out a gloating laugh as he spoke to Eva, who could not hide her smile, so certain she was of her victory.`
`"Hahaha.`
` This all sounds marvellous to me.`
` ......I had been feeling a deep pain in my heart at my estrangement from the rest of you.`
` If by accepting these conditions, I could make our sibling relationship friendly once again, I would be quite pleased."`
`"I will gladly take you up on your offer.`
` ......Be happy, Rosa.`
` We have a deal."`
`"........................"`
`Rosa's expression dimmed.`
` ......When her brother started talking like this, the conversation would never change for the better.`
`...Eva was also sensitive enough to realize this.`
`{n}Therefore, even though Krauss had obediently accepted the deal, she was unable to wipe away her feeling of insecurity.`
`"...My, how obedient.`
` That's not like you, Nii‐san."`
`"That's harsh.`
` You think I have an ulterior motive?`
` Of course I don't.`
` I'm just like all of you."`
`— I'm just like all of you.`
`{n}It felt as though only that part was emphasized.`
`The color of Rudolf's face darkened.`
`{i:"I have a plan, just like all of you"}.`
`{n}...That's what it sounded like to him.`
`That gave him a sense of urgency.`
` Trying to bring this near‐finished discussion to a conclusion, he rushed to wrap it up.`
`"......Then we are good.`
` ...So, Aniki.`
` Would you mind signing here?`
` This is a written contract containing the discussion we have been having.`
` There's one for each person.`
` Everyone will sign for the same contents."`
`Rudolf took four written contracts out of his breast pocket that had the details of their deal written on them.`
`"Of course, we'll also add the seventh condition that you proposed, straight away.`
` Don't worry."`
`"Aniki, will you use a pen?"`
`Rudolf took a fountain pen out of his breast pocket and offered it to Krauss.`
`Krauss made as if to accept it, but then, with a small laugh, drew back his hand without taking it and spoke.`
`"............Actually,`
` in order to make sure this agreement is definitely effective, I would like to propose a single amendment."`
`When Krauss said that one sentence...`
`{n}...all of the siblings felt at the same time as though something annoying was creeping up their backs.`
`"......Th‐that won't do.`
` We've already decided, haven't we?`
` Be quiet and sign it."`
`"Eva, why are you so impatient?`
` Of course I will sign.`
` I'll promise you all your share of the gold, 7.5 billion yen.`
` I also promise that, when Father's inheritance is distributed, I will cleanly and neatly liquidate it."`
`".........However, there is just one point on which I must ask you to compromise."`
`"............What are you talking about.`
` What point don't you like...?"`
`"The part about promptly paying ten percent of each portion, 750 million yen.`
` As you pointed out, my financial situation is not prosperous.`
` While I am guaranteed to definitely collect on various future investments,`
` at this time I have no choice but to admit that I am very poor."`
`"In short, I have absolutely no money that I can move around right now.`
` ......I am incompetent, and my business skills and senses are dull.`
` An "unfortunate" such as me, to use your words, has no power to move 750 million in just half a year."`
`"Th‐that can't be true.`
` Are you trying to deceive us with offhand remarks?"`
`"At the time of the division of the inheritance, I will liquidate everything at once.`
` Remove the condition that I must pay you ten percent in advance.`
` ...That is all you have to do to get me to sign."`
`"......Krauss nii‐san, that ten percent is nothin' more than a number to measure your sincerity, isn't it?`
` Strictly speakin', we shouldn't even be making you a deal in the first place.`
` We're doin' you a big favor by offerin' to let things slide for just ten percent in good faith money."`
`"We explained all that to you, so don't you think rejectin' that part damages our trusting relationship a little...?"`
`Hideyoshi had a humble expression on his face and had his hands clasped together,`
` but his eyes were not calm at all.`
`......Krauss had already seen through the shadow in the depths of those eyes.`
`".........Hmph.`
` Why are you all so hurried?`
` ...Or are you possibly afraid of something?`
` .........Rosa, won't you tell at least me?`
` ...Secretly, without telling the rest of the siblings."`
`"...............It, it's not like I......"`
`"Quit it, Aniki.`
` All we're asking is whether you're going to sign or not.`
` Just forget about making any strange deals or anything suspicious."`
`"......Hoh?`
` So I have no margin for negotiation.`
` ...Do you claim that my position is so weak that we are not in an even relationship...?"`
`Shivers began to crawl up Rudolf's back...`
`Ever since he was a child, he had never been able to overcome the height of the wall that separated him from his older brother,`
` and now again he began to feel himself getting sucked in by it, and the long shadow it cast...`
`"Shouldn't deals be made on an even footing?`
` To me, this deal is something to restore the long lost trust of my younger brother and sisters, and deepen the love between us siblings.`
` It has been a cancer in my heart, that I wished to resolve quickly."`
`"I am very happy that I am able to resolve it today.`
` .........But you too would be very happy to see this deal quickly concluded, wouldn't you...?"`
`Krauss stared at each of the siblings.`
`{n}...They avoided his gaze with animal‐like instinct.`
`Only Hideyoshi was slow avoiding it.`
`{n}...So he was caught in Krauss's gaze.`
`"Hideyoshi nii‐san.`
` I hear that your company has been going extremely well recently, hasn't it?`
` You didn't hit any problems getting it listed as a stock, and both its performance and stock prices are constantly growing.`
` I am truly jealous."`
`"......M‐my husband's situation surely has nothing to do with this."`
`"However, it is unfortunate that you have neglected your stockholders.`
` It's also horrible that you were unable to solidify your base when you became stock‐listed.`
` ......Before you realized it, some bad‐natured fellows had bought up a considerable amount of your company's stock, hadn't they?"`
`".........H‐`
`......how could you know something like that..."`
`"The same way as you.`
` If you can collect evidence proving that no one would offer a loan to me, then I can collect evidence on you.`
` Hahaha, is it really that strange of a thing?"`
`Krauss grinned broadly.`
`{n}...In contrast, Hideyoshi's face was turning obviously pale......`
`Hideyoshi's company was a fast‐food‐chain operating company that he had started from nothing.`
`Through Hideyoshi's management efforts, performance of the business repeatedly rose and magnified, and ultimately it succeeded in becoming a stock‐listed company.`
`The greatest advantage of being in the stock‐holding system is that, by selling stock certificates, a large amount of financing can be gained.`
`That amount is far greater than the actual profits from the business.`
`{n}This made it an extremely effective way to gather the massive funds needed to grow his company even further.`
`However, in exchange for financing the company, the stockholders have certain rights.`
`Namely, the right to observe and guide the company that they have financed, in order to raise its profits above their investment.`
`......That right is guaranteed to all stockholders, and they sometimes even use it to reorganize ineffectual management.`
`It is the "right" to prevent the money they have spent financing the company from going to waste, by watching the management of the company.`
`However, if they use this right forcibly, they can eject the former management and take over the company.`
`...Because the general body of all stockholders has the power to dismiss the management and nominate new management.`
`That right is exercised on a majority decision by the stockholders.`
`{n}And people who hold more stock get to cast more votes.`
`In other words, if some person or group holds a majority of the stock, they can freely chase out the old management and make the president anyone they would like.`
`If they want, it is even possible for them to make themselves president.`
`Many companies, in order to prevent their stock from being bought up by malicious people and their position from being threatened,`
` take some kind of defensive measures, such as having their own employees or people close to them buy a lot of stock certificates, in order to prevent a hostile group from securing the majority.`
`However, since Hideyoshi's company had only recently become stock‐listed, they hadn't had the time to strengthen those defensive measures.`
`No, maybe Hideyoshi himself was so engrossed in the management of his company that he hadn't realized the dangers of being stock‐listed.`
`It's hard to say whether he should be viewed as a kind‐hearted and skilled manager immersed in management, or a foolish manager who had his feet swept out from under him...`
`...But in any case, there were people out there who would not let him get away with that naivety unscathed.`
`They rapidly bought up Hideyoshi's company's stock and instantly gained a significant amount of power.`
`They then sent anonymous documents to the stockholders and began to capture the majority.`
`The documents read: "The current management continues to make pointless investments and is ignoring the needs of the stockholders.`
` Let us force the current management to retire, cut the current wasted investments, and let this company be born again as one that gives more back to the stockholders."`
`It is very difficult to make the actual state of a company's management known.`
`...They maliciously twisted the figures Hideyoshi had produced from a tiny amount of sleep and a constant concern for his company, and made him lose the trust of his stockholders.`
`Their efforts had almost collected a majority of the stock in the company.`
`...At that point, even Hideyoshi noticed and started to buy back the stock, but the stockholders, who realized that the company was undergoing an acquisition maneuver,`
` demanded a ridiculous price for the shares that Hideyoshi was trying to buy back.`
`They continually tortured Hideyoshi, who had no leeway in the negotiation of the price.`
`One of the certainties of capitalism is that value will rise when both parties vie for the same thing.`
`And one of the certainties of democracy is that the majority controls everything.`
`So in the end, whoever manages to buy up the most stock wins.`
`...So whoever has the most money wins.`
`If Hideyoshi could obtain a large sum of money at this critical time, he would be able to avoid losing all of that which he had built up...`
`{a:c:`
`THEREFORE,`
` MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE,{n}`
`HE WANTED A LOT OF MONEY RIGHT NOW...!}`
`He couldn't wait for the division of Kinzo's inheritance, which may not happen for some time.`
`"And you, Rudolf, you've been in a lot of trouble lately, haven't you?`
` They say it's scary overseas, but it seems that's really true.`
` American trials are settled quite emotionally.`
` They won't give a generous judgment to a foreigner.`
` ......Weren't you advised by your lawyer that making a settlement with the other party would be more economical in the end?"`
`"............What is he talking about...?"`
`"......Ah, it's just troubles at work.`
` It's no big deal.`
` It'll be settled with money..."`
`Kyrie quickly recognized what Rudolf's complicated expression meant.`
`......Her husband had gotten wrapped up in some kind of trouble without her knowledge, and had been suffering alone.`
`"That's right.`
` In this world, anything can be settled with money.`
` After all, it can even buy back the broken bonds between siblings!`
` America is very fussy about the violation of rights.`
` But with money, anything can be settled.`
` Long live capitalism."`
`"...Although, rumors abound that the settlement money may reach several million dollars...?"`
`Rudolf had been building a large amount of wealth with a certain type of niche market.`
`...However, a niche is a niche.`
` It's definitely not a sunny job.`
`An American corporate giant was trying to accuse Rudolf's company of violating their rights.`
`For various reasons, it was thought that winning the trial was extremely unlikely, and Rudolf was being pressed to surrender outright.`
`...But even so, there was a way to resolve it with money.`
`{n}If he could only pay that money, though it might be painful, he could still pick himself back up.`
`...But if he didn't pay, he'd lose everything.`
`{a:c:`
`THEREFORE,`
` MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE,{n}`
`HE WANTED A LOT OF MONEY RIGHT NOW...!}`
`".........Rosa, you're a good and noble little sister.`
` You wouldn't even touch a dangerous money game.`
` ...However, your softhearted nature was your ruin, wasn't it...?`
` I wouldn't think one should agree to become a co‐signer so lightly."`
`"Nn...`
`...umm...`
`...th‐that has nothing to do with you, Krauss nii‐san!!"`
`Rosa uncharacteristically lay bare her emotions and yelled.`
`{n}...Because she had thought she had kept it a secret.`
`{n}As Krauss watched, he let slip a muffled laugh...`
`......There was nothing to fear.`
` Every one of them,`
`{a:c:`
` MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE,{n}`
`WANTED A LOT OF MONEY RIGHT NOW...!}`
`In other words, the situation had been reversed.`
`Because only Krauss, who they were threatening, had no urgent need for a large sum of money.`
`Compared to that, the three who were threatening him wanted money quickly, no matter what the cost.`
`So the longer Krauss postponed this deal, the greater the advantage to him.`
`Krauss was very sly.`
`{n}He had known of their Achilles' heel from the beginning.`
`{n}Even so, he had not been certain.`
`Therefore, he had hidden that until the very end, and, upon closely and completely examining their attitude, he had struck back.`
`"If I could, I would love to raise some money for my darling brother and sisters in their time of need.`
` ...But unfortunately, I have nothing on hand."`
`"......If you have any sponsors in mind that can raise a whole 750 million, I suggest you try there first."`
`Krauss's elated words were horribly blunt.`
`{n}The other siblings could do nothing more than listen, grinding their teeth.`
`.........If they could think of a sponsor that convenient, they wouldn't have kept up this charade.`
` They had entered this huge battle specifically because they had exhausted all other options.`
`"......If you're still set on relying on your older brother,`
` I could use my influence to find you sponsors.`
` .........Oh wait, you already said that I have no influence.`
` Well then, I can't do anything, can I?`
` ......Hehheheheheheheh!"`
`Krauss's low, gloating laugh began to fill the parlor.`
`The younger siblings who had, until now, been driving the oldest brother into a corner, could do nothing more than grimace and grind their teeth...`
`"............E‐Eva......"`
`"......Don't make me laugh...`
` As if I would put myself in your debt...!`
` Don't make me laugh...`
`don't make me laugh......!"`
`"..................If...`
`...if we relied on you, how would you help us..."`
`"I told you, didn't I?`
` All I can do is find other sponsors for you.`
` Of course, I will do my utmost to negotiate so that you can borrow the interest as well.`
` Hehheheheh, gahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"......Damn you......`
`taking advantage of us............"`
`".........Baby.`
` Please calm down."`
`"I am calm. I'm extremely cool......`
` ...............You bastard...!"`
`Kyrie grabbed her husband's hand.`
`But that action made him feel even more pitiful, so Rudolf shook it off.`
`...Krauss laughed as though seeing that made him extremely happy.`
`"If only we truly could find Father's hidden gold, at a time like this.`
` Then I could split it up into 2.5 billion yen portions for you right away.`
` How sad, how sad, how very sad!`
` How extremely totally truly hopelessly sad!"`
`"............Tonight, let us drink together as brothers and sisters, and discuss the whereabouts of Father's hidden gold,`
` ......solve the riddle of {f:5:Beatrice}'s epitaph together, why don't we?"`
`"With four friendly siblings all together, there is surely no puzzle that can't be solved.`
` ...Hahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"..................Hmph.`
` How interesting.`
` And what are the conditions that they attached?"`
`"......Certainly.`
` Whether or not Krauss‐sama actually discovered the gold, he would pay Eva‐sama, Rudolf‐sama and Rosa‐sama a total of 7.5 billion yen for their shares.`
` However, ten percent of that would be paid before March."`
`"Fu, hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha...`
` Krauss, you dunce.`
` That he would have his feet swept out from under him by his younger siblings...`
` Truly amusing."`
`"......But it seems they couldn't seal the deal?"`
`".........Yes.`
` Krauss‐sama exposed that Eva‐sama and the younger siblings all had an urgent need to get money."`
`"Hmph.`
` So if he's given something that simple, he can see through it, then.`
` He can't even manage incompetence.`
` .........What are they doing now?"`
`"......That conversation has been put on hold for the time being.`
` Now, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's epitaph is being discussed."`
`"So, they are trying to solve the riddle and find out where my gold is hidden?"`
`"...............Yes."`
`Kinzo set down his glasses and snorted.`
`".........Will the miracle be fulfilled first,`
` or will those fools expose the gold first?`
` ...What a sight to behold."`
`"......If those fools solve my puzzle, at that time I will be completely defeated.`
` They can suck my corpse down to the last fragment of bone.`
` The magnitude of the fools' greed imbues my great magic with its miraculous potential."`
`"......But if!!`
` If the fulfillment of the miracle comes first...`
` If it comes first!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} will be resurrected again!!`
` That smile which I have been chasing half my life will be restored...!"`
`"Oooooohhh, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` The sacred night when the miracle is wagered will come, and the devils' game will begin...!`
` I will definitely win, and will definitely remain alive!!"`
`"You can have the lives of the others!`
` I don't need wealth or honor or assets or gold or anything!`
` I only want to see your smile one more time!!`
` *coughcoughcough*!!"`
`Kinzo choked, apparently in great pain.`
`Kanon got closer and tried to pat his master's back, but Kinzo signaled that he didn't need to.`
`"............Do you know why I went to the trouble of exposing the hidden location of the gold so that everyone could see it?"`
`"......No."`
`"It is because magical power is determined by risk.`
` The greater the number of people who try to discover {f:5:Beatrice}'s gold,`
` the greater the danger of that happening, then assuming that the bet is successful despite those long odds, the magical power will bring about an even grander miracle."`
`".........In other words, magic is a game.`
` It is not true that the most superior person will become the winner.`
` The winner becomes superior because he is granted magic.`
` Do you understand?`
` Just as the miracle of life is granted precisely because of a victory against divine odds of several hundred million to one.`
` ..................Is this a little difficult for you to understand?"`
`".........My apologies."`
`"That's fine.`
` ......It all comes down to this.`
` To the one that solves the mystery of {f:5:Beatrice}'s epitaph, I will give all of that which I have built up.`
` Wealth, honor, gold, and succession to the Ushiromiya family headship—everything that I have established!"`
`"The right to tackle the riddle is not limited to my children.`
` Even if it were you who succeeded in solving it, that would make you qualified to gain everything."`
`".........Yes.`
` However,`
` ......I couldn't possibly understand such a difficult riddle."`
`"Of course.`
` I made it difficult.`
` ...But you must also challenge it.`
` That will become the seed with which the miracle of my magic will be summoned.`
` If everyone challenges it, and everyone fails, that will be that."`
`"However, if the miracles are gathered and the magical power is born, it will happen then!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} will revive.`
` Therefore you too must challenge it.`
` All must challenge it.`
` And in doing so, they must give strength to my magic!!`
` Do you understand?!"`
`"............Yes.`
` ...I will try."`
`For a long while, Kinzo repeatedly muttered to himself, agitated and grabbing onto his head.`
`Kanon stayed where he was, alert and unmoving, until he was given the next order from his master.`
`...Kinzo finally realized this.`
`"That is all, leave me now.`
` ......There is a bag of sweets on the liquor cabinet.`
` You can take some with you as a reward."`
`"......I'm fine.`
` After all,`
` .........I am furniture."`
`"............Hmm.`
` ......So furniture doesn't eat sweets?`
` ...Indeed.`
` In that case, leave me."`
`"As you ask.`
` ......Please excuse me."`
`Kanon bowed and left the study.`
`{n}As the door was closed, a heavy locking noise resounded.`
`But that was not the sound of Kanon locking the door.`
`{n}It was the door locking automatically.`
`No one could enter without Kinzo's permission, and once they left, they could not enter again.`
`......It was a mechanism that Kinzo, unable to trust his blood relatives, had created to lock himself up in his own study and isolate himself from the outside world.`
`......The only ones he could trust now were not the sons who shared his blood, but those servants who called themselves furniture...`
`"..................Doctor Nanjo, is something the matter?"`
`"...Ah, Genji‐san.`
` Oh, it's just that I had no place in there anymore."`
`With a bitter laugh, Nanjo turned to face the door to the parlor.`
`...It seemed that because of that motion, Genji understood what Nanjo wanted to say.`
`For the most part, Genji also understood the family's situation.`
`...It must have made him want to frown, knowing that right now in the parlor, the master he served was being discussed so disrespectfully.`
`But it would have been very difficult to gather that from his indifferent expression.`
`".........Still,`
` ...it isn't clear to me.`
` ...Why did Kinzo‐san have something so provocative written, I wonder."`
`Nanjo looked at the portrait of {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}......No, he actually directed his gaze beneath the portrait, at the plate with the epitaph.`
`"...............I fail to understand the Master's thoughts.`
` I sense that they run very deep."`
`"......For as long as I can remember, whenever Kinzo‐san played chess, he would always make moves based on some far‐sighted reading of the board.`
` Yes, sometimes even moves that were incomprehensible.`
` ......For an average person like me, it is impossible to see through to whatever it is he's planning..."`
`"I personally suspect this may be some kind of will from the Master.`
` .........He most likely intends to entrust his assets and the family headship to whoever manages to comprehend it."`
`"......Hoping that the danger of some outsider like myself solving it...`
`would force the four siblings to work together to solve the riddle.`
` It could be something like that, then.`
` Kinzo‐san may rudely disparage his children, but he might also be hoping that the siblings repair their relationship."`
`"........................"`
`If, as Nanjo said, this epitaph had been written to repair the relationship between the siblings, how heartwarming that would be.`
`...However, Nanjo and Genji both knew this was the one thing that could never be the case.`
`Here were the two who held the longest relationship with Kinzo, more trusted than his blood relatives,`
` and even they could not guess at Kinzo's true motive...`
`"......The Master is always saying that the right to challenge the riddle is granted to everyone, whether they are a member of the family or not.`
` ......How about you, Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"No, no......It's a little too hard to understand for this senile old man."`
`"......Actually, I wrote this epitaph down in my notebook at one point in time.`
` Night after night, I would try to solve it before going to sleep, but...`
`...hahaha, it truly is hard.`
` I believe it shall continue providing me enjoyment for the rest of my days.`
` What about you, Genji‐san?"`
`".........I am nothing more than furniture that serves the Master.`
` Gold and assets are useless to me."`
`"My, my, you are a humble person.`
` ...That's probably why Kinzo‐san trusts you so much."`
`"If so, I am honored..."`
`As Nanjo lightly laughed in response, he once again looked at the epitaph.`
`"......Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old.`
` You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key..."`
`That which is written on the epitaph of the portrait of my beloved witch {f:5:Beatrice} is as follows:`
`{e:070:Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old.`
`{n}You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key.`
`{n}{n}As you travel down it, you will see a village.`
`{n}In that village, look for the shore the two speak of.`
`{n}There the key to the Golden Land sleeps.`
`{n}{n}You who laid hand upon the key must journey as follows to the Golden Land.}`
`{e:070:On the first twilight, sacrifice the six chosen by the key.`
`{n}On the second twilight, those who remain shall tear apart the two who are close.`
`{n}On the third twilight, those who remain shall praise my noble name.`
`{n}On the fourth twilight, gouge the head and kill.`
`{n}On the fifth twilight, gouge the chest and kill.`
`{n}On the sixth twilight, gouge the stomach and kill.`
`{n}On the seventh twilight, gouge the knee and kill.`
`{n}On the eighth twilight, gouge the leg and kill.`
`{n}On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive.`
`{n}On the tenth twilight, the journey ends, and you shall reach the Home of the Gold.}`
`{e:070:The witch shall praise the wise, and bestow four treasures.`
`{n}{n}One shall be all of the Golden Land's gold.`
`{n}One resurrects all the dead people's souls.`
`{n}One even revives all the love they possessed.`
`{n}And one for the witch to eternally rest.`
`{n}{n}Rest in peace, my beloved witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.}`
`"So...on the tenth twilight, the journey shall end,`
` and you shall reach the Golden Land.`
` You really are diligent, Maria.`
` You did a good job taking notes on all of this."`
`"Uu!`
` I forget a lot so I write things down!`
` Write things down like Mama said!"`
`There was a notebook inside the handbag Maria was always carrying around,`
` and {f:5:Beatrice}'s epitaph was copied onto it.`
`Thanks to that,`
` we were all able to challenge the puzzle of the epitaph while here on this beach.`
`For Jessica and the others,`
` this was a puzzle that they had already tried to solve several times,`
` and had already gotten bored with.`
`But it was a first for me,`
` and I was so excited that I couldn't stop.`
` It really tickled my male sense of romance!`
`"Let's start with the first line.`
` Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old.`
` Where was Grandfather's old home again?"`
`"I heard that, before the war, the Ushiromiya family had a mansion near Odawara.`
` So, that said, you'd want to know about a sweetfish river that flows through Odawara, right?"`
`"Yeah, because that river's the starting point.`
` And then it's got, you who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key.`
` What rivers are in Odawara?`
` It's got to be one with sweetfish swimming in it."`
`"For sweetfish in Odawara, it'd be the Hayakawa.`
` It's famous for its mountain stream fishing."`
`"Uu.`
` I haaate fish."`
`"Ihihi, Maria, you'll understand when you get o~lder!`
` You'll be all, licklickli~ck, salty roasted sweetfish!`
` Yummy~!`
` Even though we just ate, I'm getting hungry again."`
`"......Umm, shall I bring you some biscuits?"`
`"Huh?`
` Oh, sorry—that's not what I meant, don't mind me!"`
`Shannon‐chan, who didn't have any afternoon chores for a while, was faithfully keeping us company.`
`I would have thought that, as a servant, accompanying us would force her to take care of us and tire her out, but it seemed that it wasn't so in her case.`
`...To the contrary, it seemed she was having fun joining in on the conversation with people of a similar age.`
`When I asked, she told me she was a live‐in worker.`
`{n}So normally, the only person close in age to her was Jessica.`
`I get it, that must be pretty wearisome.`
`"Alright, so I get that the sweetfish‐filled river near Odawara is the Hayakawa.`
` In that case, we have to go down it!`
` Don't you find anything if you head down the Hayakawa?"`
`"Ummm,`
` ............if you follow it downstream, you'll arrive in the ocean."`
`"Of course, you'd reach the mouth of the river!`
` And then the third line of the epitaph was "As you travel down it, you will see a village."`
` By the way, since long ago, the mouths of rivers have generally been key points for transportation, and large cities tend to be built there.`
` That'd be the next checkpoint."`
`"Hmmmmmm.`
` That's a pretty good theory.`
` Just like you imagined, in ancient times, there was a very prosperous old city there.`
` That's where Odawara Castle is."`
`"Ah, I think I might have gone to Odawara Castle on a field trip once.`
` It really was a wonderful castle."`
`"Yeah, I went to Odawara Castle too.`
` Even though I live in a Western‐style house, it sure is true that Japanese people feel calmer with Japanese style!"`
`"Uu.`
` I think castles are boorring.`
` Theme parks are better.`
` Uu!"`
`"I see, I see. Alright, alright!`
` If we find the gold, the great Battler‐sama will generously reserve a whole theme park for a day and let you play a~ll you want!"`
`".........Still, Odawara Castle.`
` The hidden gold of Odawara Castle...`
` Oho?!`
` Kind of has the right ring to it, don't you think?!"`
`"Hahahahaha!`
` Well, we figured out that much when we tried this two years ago.`
` The village down the river where the sweetfish swim in Odawara.`
` We figured that it was probably somewhere near Odawara Castle."`
`"The problem is the next line.`
` Alright, let's see where your strange reasoning can take you."`
`Jessica grinned broadly.`
`{n}It was like she was saying that, if the puzzle could be solved so easily, she would have found it long ago.`
`...Damn it,`
` I'll definitely find it and keep it all for myself!`
`"The fourth line.`
` ...In that village, look for the shore the two speak of.`
` .........I don't know what it means by "the two", but anyway, the shore.`
` .........What does it mean by the shore?!`
` Hmmmm...`
`is there any place near there with {ruby:shore:{p:0:岸}} in its name?"`
`"Ummm,`
` ......I have heard that there is a place called {ruby:Sogakishi:{p:0:曽我岸}} in Odawara."`
`"Huh?!`
` Wow,`
` you sure know a lot!"`
`"So~, what does that mean?`
` Shannon‐chan, are you also after the gold, and trying to solve the riddle~?`
` That makes us rivals!"`
`"It, it's not like I'm interested in gold...`
` It's just that...George‐sama told me about it before..."`
`"That's because we reached the same conclusion two years ago.`
` We even went and laid out a map and looked it up!"`
`"It was about five kilometers to the north of Odawara Castle.`
` There certainly was a place called Sogakishi there."`
`"......But after that, we get stuck.`
` The fifth line doesn't say where the key is hidden in that place.`
` Maria‐chan, could you read it for us?"`
`"...Uu.`
` ......There the key to the...`
`Golden Land...`
`sleeps."`
`"Uu!`
` I read it!"`
`"Sogakishi is probably large, and there wasn't ever any house built there by the Ushiromiya family.`
` With no hint to where the key is hidden in that huge area, we pretty much have to throw in the towel."`
`"You're right.`
` ...And without the key, we can't advance to the next line.`
` George‐aniki, what kind of place is Sogakishi?"`
`"I'm not sure...`
` I've never been there, so I don't really know, but according to the map, it's in the mountains.`
` I'm pretty sure it was at the base of Mount Asama."`
`"......Hmmmm.`
` Something doesn't sit right with me here.`
` Aren't puzzles for the hiding place of treasure meant to be a bit more exact than this?`
` I get the feeling we're barking up the wrong tree with Sogakishi."`
`"I dunno about that, Sogakishi looks suspicious to me!`
` There might be some house there that we just don't know about, that Grandfather lived in when he was a kid.`
` I mean, the first line did go on about his beloved home of old."`
`"...Shannon, Grandfather has you pouring drinks and stuff for him a lot, right?`
` Haven't you ever been made to listen to stories from his past?"`
`"......The Master almost never speaks of his past.`
` ...However, I've heard him speak of the Great Kanto Earthquake that almost destroyed the Ushiromiya family as though it had nothing to do with him,`
` so he may have been living far away from the Kanto area."`
`"The Ushiromiya main family may have been living in Odawara, but the branch families probably weren't limited to that.`
` Grandfather often called himself a branch of a branch family, and the least connected to the succession,`
` after all."`
`"So, in other words!`
` The beloved home of old might not even be Odawara at all..."`
`"I've never even asked about Grandfather's old home.`
` And he probably wouldn't give it away if I did."`
`"If the so‐called beloved home of old isn't referring to the Ushiromiya family's roots, then the Odawara theory is wrong from the beginning.`
` Of course, this doesn't remove all possibility that it was Sogakishi.`
` For example, he could have lived in Odawara when he was very young, but then moved far away later."`
`"Uu...`
` I don't get what you're talking about.`
` Uu."`
`Maria had been completely left out of the conversation, and she now sat puffing out her cheeks in boredom.`
`"Well, basically,`
` if we can't decide where the start is for our golden game of Chutes and Ladders, we can't even begin to play."`
`"...............But wait...?`
` In the first five lines the thing we're searching for is a key, right?`
` You can enter a door even without a key, just by busting right through it.`
` Can't we just throw away the first five lines and start figuring out the rest?"`
`"Ooh...`
` I hadn't thought of that."`
`"Oh well, we're just killing time anyway.`
` Let's hear the rest of your reasoning!"`
`"......But in the next part it quickly becomes disturbing..."`
`Shannon‐chan frowned slightly.`
`After looking back at Maria's notebook to recall what was written there,`
` ...alright, I agree.`
`"On the first twilight, sacrifice the six chosen by the key...`
` It sure does get horrible quickly."`
`"On the second twilight, it says to tear apart the two who are close.`
` Does that mean to make them break off their romance?`
` Or literally tear them apart?`
` I don't know, but either way, it's pretty disgusting."`
`"Even if we ignore the meaning of that second line, on the first twilight it's six people,`
` and on the fourth through eighth twilights it's five people,`
` so at least eleven people must become sacrifices."`
`"Uu.`
` Sacrifices to revive {f:5:Beatrice}!"`
`"...I see, sacrifices to bring back the witch...`
` I guess you can take it that way.`
` As a result, the witch revives on the ninth twilight......`
` ...This last part is glorious."`
`"............On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive.`
` ......So everyone dies in the end anyway."`
`"And then it's got the goal finally being reached on the tenth twilight that follows.`
` Not sure how anyone "shall reach the Golden Land" if everyone's dead."`
`"...It seems to allow for different interpretations as to whether or not the traveler who holds the key would be included in the "none shall be left alive" part."`
`"But there's something pretty interesting written at the end.`
` The lines about how, after reaching the goal,`
` four treasures will be given by the witch.`
` One shall be all the gold.`
` The problem is the next one.`
` It says she'll resurrect all the dead people's souls, right?`
` Doesn't it seem like this refers to everyone that died in the earlier lines?"`
`".........If you put it like that, the next one, the part about even reviving the love they possessed,`
` might be referring to the pair torn apart on the second twilight."`
`"That's right.`
` And the fourth one refers to the ninth twilight.`
` The fourth treasure is putting the witch, revived on the ninth twilight, back to sleep again."`
`"...If we interpret it favorably,`
` it's hectic with people dying and being broken up, but it's all made well in the end.`
` The awakened witch once again sleeps, and all that's left is plenty of gold."`
`"The witch must have her hands full with all this killing, reviving, breaking up, and reuniting people."`
`"Not to mention waking up and sleeping.`
` Hahahahaha."`
`"Oh well, just when the tale of the hidden gold was getting interesting, as soon as the witch's story is tied in, it quickly gets pretty shady."`
`"No kidding, ahahahahahaha!"`
`I laughed along with Jessica.`
`{n}After all, a witch was just ridiculous.`
`...Of course, once we started laughing like that, Maria, who believed in witches, got angry.`
`"Uu!`
` Witches are awesome!`
` They can do anything with magic!`
` Even kill.`
` Even bring back to life.`
` Even give love, even take it."`
`"Can fly in the sky, can become invisible, can even make gold and bread out of nothing!`
` Uu!`
` Uu!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Erk, oh no...`
` My bad...it's just a joke!"`
`Jessica apologized, sticking out her tongue, but Maria didn't accept it.`
`She grabbed her notebook back out of my hands, and, opening to the other pages, tried to prove that witches existed.`
`Those pages had colored illustrations of witches drawn on them,`
` and conveyed the fantastical image Maria had of witches well.`
`They were not depicted as the normal sinister crooked‐nosed hags flying around on brooms,`
` but as dreamlike people with mysterious powers, who could do anything and wore beautiful dresses—`
`just what you would expect from an imaginative young girl.`
`Dancing through the sky, crossing a rainbow,`
` dancing around all night with magical teacups and teapots that would never get empty no matter how much you poured out of them.`
`With a flourish of their wands, the stars in the sky would become candy and pour down,`
` and flowers that produced sweets would bud by the roadside.`
`......To Maria, witches were the sole thing that could give form to the magical dreams that so captivated her.`
`The last thing enriching her reality, which revealed more and more of its bland nature to her with every inch she grew.`
`That was why Maria believed in witches.`
`She didn't want that dream to be insulted.`
`{n}And for that very reason, nor did she want the epitaph, which affirmed the existence of witches, to be insulted.`
`Because the witch {f:5:Beatrice} {i:is} Maria's dream...`
`"To Maria‐chan, this is not something that points to the hiding place of the gold,`
` but magic to revive the witch."`
`So, it was the single bridge...`
`between Maria and the witch.`
`Maria was very angry and clung onto George‐aniki.`
`Jessica and I scratched our heads and apologized.`
`...It might not be possible to smooth things over again like the time she got mad in front of the portrait.`
`Maria didn't want to be easily consoled.`
`{n}As Jessica and I hung our heads, wondering what we could do, Shannon‐chan timidly opened her mouth in our place.`
`"Umm,`
` .........Maria‐sama, did you know...?`
` There is a ghost story about {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama that has been passed down amongst the servants."`
`"......Uu?"`
`"Ah, ahh, yeah, that's right!`
` Shannon, tell us about it.`
` I don't really know, but it's apparently pretty famous amongst the servants."`
`"What's this?`
` A ghost story?"`
`"Yes.`
` It seems it's a story from before we were born.`
` I've also heard it from my mother."`
`"......Yes.`
` It has been passed down since the mansion was built on this island.`
` ......The servants of that time whispered that the mansion had two masters, one of the day and one of the night."`
`The tale that Shannon told...`
`was just like a typical campfire ghost story.`
`If there was a forest with a witch living inside it,`
` ...then, inevitably, the witch was going to pay the mansion a visit.`
`At some point, this ghost story naturally sprouted up between the servants.`
`"Doors and windows they were sure they'd shut or locked would be open when they came around to double‐check.`
` Lights they'd definitely turned off would be on,`
` and lights they'd definitely turned on would be off.`
` Things would disappear from where they had been placed,`
` and things would appear when no one had any memory of putting them there."`
`"......When any of these things happened, the old servants would say that the witch had visited the mansion, invisible, and had played pranks."`
`"Uu!`
` See, she exists!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} exists!!"`
`"Yeah, she exists.`
` I remember often being unable to find my bag before heading to school..."`
`Maria puffed out her chest with an "uu‐uu" as though this was the final proof that the witch existed.`
`If I said it out loud, Maria would probably be hurt again, so I didn't, but...`
`...I mean, you hear that kind of story everywhere.`
`Depending on the place, it might be blamed on fairies or something.`
`{n}It's just that, on this island, they call it the witch.`
`Of course, you would expect that walking around a vast, elegant mansion at night would be a little unsettling.`
`It's an island devoid of people.`
` Since the mansion is so drafty, walking around on the night of a thunderstorm would certainly be eerie.`
`"In addition, some servants have also seen will‐o'‐the‐wisps and glittering butterflies dancing around.`
` ......Kanon‐kun also said he saw something like that when he went patrolling one night."`
`"And recently, the servants have been talking about strange footsteps inside the mansion near midnight.`
` We have whispered together that {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama from the portrait sometimes makes herself invisible and walks through the mansion."`
`"...It happened a long time ago,`
` but I have also heard those kinds of footsteps while patrolling at night."`
`"......Whew.`
` That's scary..."`
`"Ah, ...but,`
` there's nothing to be afraid of, you know?`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is another ruler of this mansion separate from the Master.`
` So, she won't do anything bad, as long as you respect her and don't act oddly afraid."`
`"However, she's fearsome if you don't respect her, right?"`
`"...Yes.`
` I heard that someone who quit just before I began working, after falling down the stairs and receiving a large injury to their back,`
` had been speaking badly of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` Because of that, there was a rumor between the servants that {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's anger had been brought down upon this person..."`
`"Uu...`
` Anger will definitely be brought down on Battler and Jessica...`
` Uu..."`
`"I, I, I'm sorry!`
` I don't want her anger brought down upon me!`
` I apologize, Maria.`
` Of course, I also apologize to the witch.`
` I'm sorry, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, please forgive an outsider's nonsense."`
`"I'll apologize as well.`
` I'm sorry, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` .........Will the witch be able to forgive us now?"`
`"...Uu.`
` Don't know.`
` Witches are fickle, so they forgive when they forgive, and don't when they don't.`
` Uu!"`
`"That's no good...`
` Maria‐chan, isn't there some kind of charm that could prevent Battler‐kun and Jessica‐chan from having {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's anger brought down upon them?`
` Maybe something to ward off magic?"`
`By relying on Maria, who was proud of knowing the most about witches, George was trying to revive her self‐esteem.`
`......I was once again forced to admire his ability to comfort children.`
`After crossing her arms and pondering seriously as to whether there was some charm capable of protecting Jessica and myself from the witch's wrath,`
` Maria began flipping through the pages of her handbook.`
`I had thought it was just a simple scribbled diary,`
` ......but it turned out that there were also many pages that looked like they had come from a book on black magic.`
`She was intently comparing several such pages, onto which had been copied what looked like magic circles.`
`.........It looks like that black magic hobby wasn't limited to Grandfather alone.`
`Perhaps she had finished her research;`
` she vigorously closed the notebook with a snap, threw it into her handbag, and began fishing through that bag's contents.`
`It seemed that various jumbled up things were in there.`
`For a while, she continued to take out various pieces of junk—although they were probably important magical items to her—`
`and repeatedly throw them back in, saying they were wrong.`
`She looked a little humorous, almost like Santa Claus deliberating over which present to give.`
`Finally, it seemed that she had excavated what she was looking for.`
`With a face unimaginably brighter than the difficult expression she had worn until now, she stuck "them" out to Jessica and me.`
`"Uu!"`
`As I reached out to grab it, I noticed that it was a very cheap‐looking charm.`
`It looked like a bracelet made from a plastic rosary,`
` with a scorpion‐motif medal attached.`
`I mean, you often find cheap accessories that correspond to the constellations.`
`It felt like a gift that you might win in the crane game at an arcade.`
` It really looked like something like that.`
`There were two.`
` Probably one for me and one for Jessica.`
`......However, considering the odd fact that there were two of them, they looked like cheap manufactured goods,`
` and it was quite hard to think of them as magical items.`
`"You're giving these to me and Battler?"`
`"Uu!`
` With these charms, even {f:5:Beatrice} is no problem!`
` Because the scorpion has the power to block magic!"`
`"Huh, really?`
` Didn't think scorpions could do that."`
`"Uu, Battler doesn't believe!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!"`
`I had inflamed Maria again because I said too much...`
`Maria took out her notebook again, and turned and pointed to page after page,`
` going on and on about how the scorpion had holy power, and had been drawn on magic‐repelling magic circles since ancient times.`
`"......Ah, I've heard about that from some of the other young servants.`
` Something about how the scorpion is drawn as a magic‐repelling symbol in sorcery..."`
`"Huh, really...!"`
`"Uu!`
` The scorpion protects against bad magic and disasters.`
` And emerald brings peace to the heart.`
` So it has double the effect!`
` Uu!"`
`"It's true.`
` The scorpion is wrapping around an emerald, protecting it.`
` I see, that seems very useful."`
`I really wanted to make fun of this worthless‐looking charm,`
` but as I watched Maria explaining the charm with all of her heart, and realized that she had prepared them out of consideration for us,`
` it felt as though, even if it were just a prize from a game center, it would still be beneficial.`
`Material quality isn't what's important about charms.`
` It's the strength of the feelings behind them.`
`{n}I'd like to think I have enough respect for myself not to make fun of those.`
`"Okay, thank you.`
` I apologized to {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, but, even in the worst case where I'm cursed, I'll be safe now thanks to your charm.`
` Right, Jessica?"`
`"Yeah, that's right!`
` Thank you, Maria."`
`"Uu!`
` Wear it on your arm when you want a peaceful heart.`
` If you put it in your wallet, your money won't go down!`
` If you hang it from a doorknob, bad things can't get in!`
` A really useful charm!"`
`"What an incredible effect.`
` If it is a charm that Maria‐sama can recommend with confidence, I am sure it will be reliable."`
`As Shannon‐chan tapped her hands together lightly, Maria stuck out her chest.`
`She was completely cheered up again.`
`If it would keep her in this good of a mood, it would probably be worth it to let Maria lead the discussion for a while longer.`
`When you think about it, she hadn't shared in our excitement when we talked about the gold's hidden location, so I think she had gotten a little bored.`
`While eating the cookies Kumasawa‐san had baked, Jessica and I asked Maria this and that about black magic.`
`Maria happily chatted away in response to our questions.`
`For each one, George‐aniki and Shannon‐chan would act surprised and agree with everything she said.`
`The color of the clouds in the sky grew progressively heavier, but the cousins really enjoyed communicating freely after one year of separation...`
`"......Hm.`
` Did I just feel a drop on my forehead?"`
`"Huh?`
` You might have."`
`As George‐aniki rubbed his forehead, he looked up at the sky.`
`Considering the color of the sky and the dampness of the air, raindrops could easily have started falling down at any moment.`
`It also seemed like the wind had gotten a little stronger.`
`"Uu?`
` I didn't feel a drop.`
` I'm the only one.`
` Uu!"`
`"Calm down, neither did I.`
` Anyway, I'm sure that it'll rain so much tonight that everyone will get the same amount of raindrops."`
`"That's right.`
` Maybe we should head back soon...?"`
`Shannon‐chan looked down at her watch.`
`{n}It may already be well into the evening.`
`"Time to get back to work already?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...I enjoyed this time I spent together with you all.`
` Thank you very much."`
`"Tell Kumasawa‐san thanks for the cookies.`
` Alright everyone, help out with the cleanup."`
`Shannon‐chan declined our help, saying that this was a servant's job,`
` but picking up a dropped fork before the waitress has to is like my purpose in life.`
`We folded up the blanket, gathered up the trash, and helped clean everything up.`
`"Uu!`
` The trash is getting awayyy!`
` Uu‐uu!!"`
`"Oh no it isn't, I'll grab it before you!"`
`"Uu!!`
` I'm going to get it!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!"`
`"Mariaa!`
` Don't get your shoes wet, you'll get in trouble!"`
`To Maria, chasing after some trash that the strong winds had sent flying was just like an extension of our playtime.`
`By the time we finished cleaning up, the wind had started blowing very strongly.`
`It looked like a good chance to head back.`
`"You all really helped me out.`
` Thank you very much."`
`"...It really looks like you're out of time.`
` It's alright if you head back first."`
`George‐aniki perceived from her hurried appearance that very little of her free time was left.`
`"Genji‐san is very rigorous about time.`
` If you aren't at the right place at the right time, he can be very strict."`
`"We'll see you later.`
` Do your best with your work."`
`"Ye‐yes!`
` ......Then if you will excuse me."`
`After making a respectful bow, Shannon‐chan hurried off in the direction of the rose garden.`
`"Okay, let's head back to the guesthouse.`
` We can watch TV or something and relax a little."`
`"Uu!`
` Watch TV!`
` Watch TV, uu!"`
`"Then it's decided.`
` Let's all head back and watch TV together."`
`Even Maria, who was still not tired of playing, agreed when she thought about watching TV.`
`We headed up the gentle stairs and returned to the rose garden.`
`The wind had become very strong, and roses shook throughout the garden like ripples on water.`
`This might be our last chance to see these beautiful roses.`
`{n}Tonight's typhoon is sure to ruin them...`
`"These roses might be done in by tonight's winds."`
`"Yeah.`
` I'd say they were lucky, though.`
` After all, they got to welcome all of you before the typhoon."`
`"A flower will always lose its petals at some point.`
` However, because of that, we can admire them even more when they are in bloom."`
`"That's right.`
` ...Maria, burn this image into your eyes.`
` At this moment, they are the best roses of the year."`
`"Uu.`
` Burned into eyes."`
`Right then, Maria suddenly clapped her hands.`
`{n}It looked like she had remembered something.`
`"......My rose...`
` The typhoon will send it flying.`
` ......Uu!"`
`"Oh, you mean that unhealthy rose George‐aniki marked with a ribbon?"`
`It seemed that Maria remembered where the rose was.`
`She ran at full speed.`
` The rest of us followed her.`
`"............Uu?`
` Uu."`
`"Where was that again...?`
` I'm sure it was somewhere around here."`
`We searched everywhere around that area, but, after all, it was only a single flower amongst all of these roses.`
`Even though we knew it was somewhere close by, it wasn't proving easy to find.`
`The winds that made up the front lines of the typhoon were making the roses throughout the garden undulate.`
` It was almost like it was teasing us by making the location of Maria's rose impossible to find...`
`"Maybe it wasn't here...`
` Let's try spreading out a bit in our search."`
`"Sounds good.`
` Let's go for strength in numbers."`
`".........Hm?`
` What's up, Maria?"`
`As we made to split up and search, Maria tugged on my jacket with an unhappy face.`
`......It felt like her intention was to stop us from going to another place.`
`"What is it, what happened?"`
`"......Uu.`
` My rose is here.`
` It's here...!"`
`"But it's actually not, is it...?`
` Maybe it was on the other side of the flower bed.`
` If we all look, we'll find it fast, right?"`
`"Uu!!`
` It's here!`
` My rose is here!!`
` Look for it!`
` Look—for—it!!`
` Uuu!!"`
`Maria stomped her feet in irritation.`
`......She was pointing at the spot, saying it was definitely there, yet it actually wasn't.`
`And yet, if we went to go search elsewhere, she got mad.`
`...We were at a loss for what to do.`
`For a while, we would have to stay with Maria,`
` and pretend to search through this rose thicket.`
`"......Uu.`
` Uu...!`
` Not here.`
` ......Not here!`
` Not here!`
` Uuu!!"`
`Maybe she's saying that it should be here but isn't.`
`{n}Maria became increasingly ill‐tempered...`
`"...Oh man,`
` Maria is really losing her temper."`
`"Maria sometimes starts to really care about really pointless things.`
` If she gets what she wants, that's alright, but..."`
`"You can't find something that isn't there...`
` That's not good..."`
`Just as we were starting to despair for a way out of the situation,`
` Maria shouted out loudly.`
`"Mamaa!!`
` Uu‐uu!!"`
`In the direction she was waving her hand, Auntie Rosa's figure was visible.`
`Maybe she wanted to look at the garden one more time before the typhoon came,`
` or maybe she had some business at the guesthouse.`
`Auntie Rosa was coming from the mansion.`
`{n}She quickly noticed her daughter's voice and came over.`
`"Oh my, what happened, everyone?`
` Are you looking for something?"`
`"Look for iiit!`
` Mama, you look for my rose too!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Your rose?"`
`"We found an unhealthy rose around here and marked it."`
`"We tied a candy wrapper or something around it, tight.`
` ...But Maria, if I remember correctly, it was growing right in front and really stood out, didn't it?`
` Unless it grew legs and ran off somewhere, it must've been somewhere else.`
` Aren't you just remembering it wrong?"`
`"Uu!!`
` It is here!!`
` It—is—here!!`
` Battler doesn't believe!`
` Uu‐uu!!"`
`"For the umpteenth time, will you please stop that "uu‐uu" nonsense?!`
` Mama will look for it, so stay quiet!!"`
`I was a little surprised to see Auntie Rosa, who I had only ever seen as gentle, get angry.`
`Auntie Rosa began searching as well, so we went along with her for the time being,`
` but we were already more than sure that it wasn't around here.`
`...And so, Auntie Rosa also realized, very quickly, that it wasn't here.`
`"The rose isn't here.`
` Did you mistake this place for somewhere else?`
` There are so many roses around—"`
`"Uu!!`
` Uuuu!!!`
` That's wrong!!`
` It is here!!`
` Mama doesn't believe!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`"I do believe you, that's why I'm searching!`
` But it isn't here!"`
`"Uu‐uu!!`
` But it is here!!`
` It is here but it isn't!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Then someone must have ripped it out!`
` Just stop whining like that!!"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Who ripped out my rose, who?!!`
` Give it back, give it back!!`
` Uu‐uu!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`"How should I know!!`
` Stop it, stop that whining!!"`
`Auntie Rosa slapped Maria's left cheek with her palm.`
`{n}For that instant, Maria was shocked into silence.`
`Of course, it was only for an instant.`
`{n}When Maria realized that her wish was being rejected before it could be fulfilled, she started yelling with an increasingly louder voice.`
`"Uu‐uu!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` My rose!`
` My rose!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`"Didn't I tell you to stop that weird habit!!`
` That's why all of the kids in your class make fun of you!!`
` Cut it out!!"`
`Once again, her palm slapped Maria's cheek.`
`This time she didn't go silent.`
`{n}She choked as she started crying, and began to bawl in an increasingly louder voice...`
`Auntie Rosa was clearly irritated, and lifted her hand once more to try and shut her daughter up...`
`"A‐Auntie Rosa...`
` Now, now...she's just a little kid...there's no reason to get so serious...ihihi."`
`I attempted to intervene with a forced smile and my hands clasped together,`
` ...but the deadly serious look I was thrown by Auntie Rosa taught me quickly that I shouldn't butt in.`
`"I'm sorry, would you all return to your room for a little while?`
` Your auntie needs to have a little talk with Maria."`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Nobody believes in my rose!!`
` Even though it was here!!`
` Uu‐uu!!`
` Look for it!!`
` Look—for—it!!`
` Here, it was here!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`"But it's not here!!`
` Then you must be confusing it with somewhere else, mustn't you?!"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` It is here!!`
` It is definitely here!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Then it has disappeared!!`
` Give it up!!"`
`"Why?!`
` Why did my rose disappear?`
` Why, why?!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`"I don't know that!!`
` So stop saying "uu‐uu"!!"`
`Auntie Rosa once again raised her hand and, overrun by emotions, slapped Maria's cheek.`
`{n}It was so strong, it knocked Maria over.`
`"H‐hey...Auntie Rosa,`
` even if she is your daughter, you shouldn't be violent like that..."`
`I stepped between them to protect Maria, who was still on the ground, crying "uu‐uu".`
`......I know that problems between parent and child are none of my business as an outsider.`
`{n}But I wasn't brought up to just silently observe something like this...`
`"Don't you think it's weird, Battler‐kun?`
` Do you have any girls at your school that mutter "uu‐uu"?"`
`"Well, I am in high school...`
` But for an elementary schooler, I think saying "uu‐uu" is pretty cute..."`
`"Cute?`
` Saying "uu‐uu" is cute?`
` Cute?!"`
`It seemed that my reckless words had brought Auntie Rosa's wrath down upon me.`
`{n}She grabbed my collar with a terrifying expression...`
`"Don't say such nonsense!!`
` Do you know how old Maria is?`
` She's nine years old!`
` She's a fourth grader, you know?!`
` She's not a kindergartner!`
` And even so, she still says "uu‐uu" during class!!"`
`"Do you understand?!`
` This kid, do you know what they say about her when they bully her?!`
` Thanks to this weird habit, she still hasn't made even a single friend!`
` Don't turn your eyes from reality and recklessly call Maria cute!!`
` Think much, much more seriously about this kid's future!!!"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`"I told you, stop saying "uu‐uu"!!!`
` Didn't I tell you to stop it!!"`
`Auntie Rosa struck Maria's quivering head from which an increasingly unsatisfied voice was rising.`
`I tried to stop her, but she thrust me away...`
`My back collided with George‐aniki.`
`"......A long time ago, Auntie Rosa also thought of it as nothing more than one of Maria‐chan's baby words...`
`but she is now midway through elementary school, so the fact that it hasn't been fixed has bothered her a lot recently..."`
`"It's not like it matters what kind of words she uses..."`
`"You can't become a proper member of society like that.`
` ...So, even though it's not a pleasant scene to watch,`
` ......this is a problem between mother and child."`
`".........Well,`
` my mom's always giving me hell about how I speak, too."`
`If you look at it that way, maybe an outsider shouldn't interfere with this, even though it's painful to watch...`
`"Battler‐kun, didn't you ever have any bad habits as a kid that you couldn't fix and got you in trouble?"`
`"......Well, one or two.`
` On Parents' Day, I got a huge telling‐off in front of everyone, and it was so embarrassing, I couldn't stand it."`
`"Well then, you can understand Maria‐chan's feelings right now.`
` ......I'm sure she doesn't want us to be here now.`
` ......Do you understand as well, Jessica‐chan?"`
`"............I don't think anyone likes to be seen when they're being punished."`
`"Let's go.`
` Let's return to the guesthouse.`
` Then, after Maria‐chan comes back,`
` let's welcome her as if nothing happened.`
` ...That's...probably for the best, isn't it?"`
`We thought that George‐aniki's point was probably correct,`
` ...and if we could use that correct‐sounding reason to justify our retreat from this painful scene, that was probably enough for us.`
`Jessica and I nodded at George‐aniki, and we all left.`
`We called towards Maria that we were going to head to the guesthouse,`
` but since it didn't seem to reach her ears, we felt guilty and shameless even saying it...`
`"In that case, look by yourself as much as you want!`
` Mama doesn't care!!"`
`"Uu!!!`
` Look for it!`
` I'll look for it by myself!!`
` Look for it even if Mama doesn't care!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Have it your way!!"`
`After blasting her with those last few words, Rosa spun on her heels and quickly returned to the mansion.`
`Maria probably viewed that as a cold, hurtful gesture.`
`But from Rosa's perspective, that was not her intention.`
`...It was because the hand which she had so emotionally struck Maria's cheek with was still numb.`
`...It was because, if she stayed there screaming, she might again be taken over by her emotions, and continue slapping her daughter's cheek over and over.`
`After Rosa left, only Maria was left in the rose garden, all alone.`
`The wind began to blow stronger and stronger, and every once in a while, a raindrop would fall on her forehead.`
`...However, Maria couldn't leave that place.`
`{n}Not until she found that poor, withering rose.`
`It had definitely been there.`
` ......And yet,`
` it wasn't there.`
`{n}Even though she knew the place, and even though this was it,`
` it wasn't there.`
`Maria, while bitterly staring at the place it was supposed to be, thought frantically.`
`Maybe the angle I'm looking from is wrong.`
`{n}Maybe the height I'm looking from is wrong.`
`......While gazing at a single point,`
` Maria repeatedly changed her position and continued to stare.`
`The wind was getting increasingly stronger......`
`But Maria kept on looking for that rose in front of the flower bed...`
`.........Kinzo noticed the sound of the raindrops beating on the window.`
`{n}It had finally started to rain.`
`{n}It had begun later than the weather report had predicted.`
`Kinzo, as if being summoned by the sound of the rain, approached the window.`
`{n}The sound of the rain is a sound of silence.`
`That sound feels quieter than any silence,`
` and makes humans remember that, in the end, they are alone from when they are born to when they die.`
`"......You're late, {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`Were those words directed at the rainy sky...?`
`{n}No one could be seen in the direction of Kinzo's gaze.`
`"......So, shall we begin?`
` Our banquet of miracles.`
` ......In this very moment, this island has been cut off from the world.`
` Now there are none who can interrupt my ritual."`
`"There are many fitting sacrifices for you.`
` Four of my children.`
` Three of their companions.`
` Four of my grandchildren.`
` Me and my guests and my servants!`
` You may eat up as many as you please."`
`"The key of fate will select the sacrifices in accordance with the Demons' Roulette.`
` If that roulette chooses me, even I will become your sacrifice.`
` ......However, because of that...`
`because I will bet on that madness,`
` ......I will definitely create a grand miracle."`
`"...Come, devour as much as you wish...!!`
` I will overcome that roulette.`
` Yes, I'll put everything on the line.`
` First, I will return the headship of the Ushiromiya family.`
` Take it!!"`
`As Kinzo violently opened the window, he ripped the golden ring from his finger, and forcefully threw it away.`
`......At that moment, thunder resounded, giving the illusion that the lightning had accepted the ring.`
`"And.........when you are resurrected,`
` it will be me who stands there.`
` I will live until the end and watch over you as you awaken."`
`".........Now come, {f:5:Beatrice}...`
` Welcome to my banquet...!`
` In exchange for all that I have created, show me a miracle one final time.`
` ......Oooooohh,`
` ...{f:5:BeatriceeEee}............"`
`A news ticker popped up on top of the TV program we were watching.`
`{n}The disaster report told how municipalities all over were continually sending out rain, flood, and wave warnings.`
`Of course, the harshly beating raindrops on the window were much more convincing.`
`"......This rain's incredible.`
` Still, when it's raining this hard, it feels like it's going to stop soon."`
`"You wish!`
` They said the typhoon's moving slow, so it could be like this all day tomorrow.`
` And even a little weather'd be enough to stop the boats."`
`"It looks like we won't be able to head out on Sunday after all.`
` ...I'm glad I was cautious and didn't make any appointments for Monday with the outside world."`
`"I guess this means...ihihi...it looks like we'll be skipping school Monday~.`
` Living on an island's starting to look pretty good!`
` ......Come to think of it, Jessica, you have to take a boat to school every day, right?`
` What do you do when the boats are closed down?`
` Do you stay home when it rains and show up late when the wind's blowing, like King Kamehameha?"`
`"If the boats don't come, I stay home.`
` Still, it's not as good as it sounds.`
` Most of the time, I get ordered to do private study, and they're super anal about checking it, so it's not like I can take it easy."`
`"During the rainy season, when the weather stays bad for a long time,`
` you must be forced to miss a bunch of days in a row?"`
`"Yep, that happens.`
` But then, every single day, I'll get a call from my homeroom teacher, sourly instructing me on what to study and what to turn in."`
`"She can't slack off as easily as you're thinking, Battler‐kun.`
` She has to follow the rules for people that travel to school by boat and get a good amount of studying done."`
`"It'd actually be easier to just go to school.`
` In my own room, I get distracted and can't concentrate.`
` Plus, being made to do nothing but workbooks for several days straight is really mentally stressful."`
`"......When I'm ready for college, I really just wanna go some place with dorms and say goodbye and good riddance to this pain‐in‐the‐ass island."`
`"Huh...`
` So, by the way, what do you do when the weather's good in the morning, but then gets so bad on your way home that the boats are closed?`
` Do you spend the night at school?"`
`"That actually happens a lot.`
` So they have some lodgings there for people who can't get back to the island.`
` I stay over there.`
` Sometimes, when it gets really bad, I can't get back home for a few days at a time."`
`"If you look at it from the perspective of those people who have to go to school every day on a train packed to over 200% capacity,`
` it's easy to irresponsibly think that going to school on a boat seems pretty interesting and fun.`
` But it's actually hard work in a lot of ways."`
`"Inconsiderate tourists say that kind of thing all the time.`
` I've had enough of island life.`
` I want to finish high school quick and leave this island behind."`
`"There must've been a full boarding school you could've gone to.`
` Why'd you go and choose the school on Niijima?"`
`"That's what I wanted from the very beginning!!`
` It's Mom, she's always going on about how I need to learn manners and discipline as the successor to the head."`
`"...In the end, I got stuck with a high school close to home.`
` Man, I hate this island.`
` I just want to go live in a city.`
` A city where it doesn't matter if rain or even spears fall from the sky, 'cause as long as you stick some casual clothes and sandals on,`
` you can still get to a shop in less than five minutes..."`
`"Hahahaha.`
` Hold out just a bit more.`
` It's only a little longer until you graduate high school, right?"`
`"I can't wait a little longer.`
` Aaaaaah..."`
`Jessica stretched out and reclined on the sofa.`
`Maybe because now was a bad time slot, there weren't any interesting programs on,`
` and we had nothing to do but languidly kill time until we were called for dinner.`
`In the end, Maria had not returned to the cousins' room.`
`She had probably been brought back to the mansion by Auntie Rosa.`
`It had to be pretty boring for Maria, all by herself while the adults are having a confusing conversation.`
`......We thought we might head over to the mansion to see her, but after all, there was this lousy weather,`
` and there wasn't much time until dinner, so we stayed where we were.`
`At that time, we heard the sound of a humble knock.`
`{n}Jessica answered.`
`"Hello~!"`
`".........The preparations for dinner are complete.`
` Please come to the mansion."`
`It was Kanon‐kun's voice.`
` He went to all the trouble of coming from the mansion in this rain just to call us over?`
`Couldn't he have just called us on the telephone?`
`{n}......Oh well, maybe sometimes part of a servant's duty is to go against common sense.`
`"Just when I was getting hungry.`
` Let's go."`
`George‐aniki turned off the television and stood up.`
`"My stomach's been growling for a~ges!`
` Main family dinners were always fancy as hell, every time!`
` And didn't Gohda‐san say it was calf steak or something?`
` Oohh, I can't wai~t!!"`
`"They get even more fabulous on the day of the family conference.`
` Even I'm looking forward to it!`
` Let's go, let's go."`
`As we left the room, Kanon‐kun bowed silently and respectfully.`
`"Alright, let's go.`
` Is the rain nasty out there?"`
`"......Yes.`
` Please take care not to get your garments wet."`
`After seeing the three of us out, Kanon‐kun peered into the empty room.`
`".........Is Maria‐sama not with you...?"`
`"Nope?`
` Isn't she with Auntie Rosa?"`
`Rosa, lying on a sofa in the empty parlor, had fallen asleep at some point.`
`...She was bearing a burden on her shoulders that the children could never even imagine.`
`Therefore, when she let herself relax, that exhaustion quickly led her into the world of sleep.`
`Realizing this, Genji brought a blanket over to her.`
`{n}When he tried to spread it over her, her eyes snapped open as though she had received an electric shock.`
`"..................ah...!`
`.........`
` ......Oh, it's you, Genji‐san......thank you."`
`When she realized that the thing that had touched her was just a blanket, and that Genji had been considerately giving it to her, she let out a sigh of relief.`
`"......Did I wake you?`
` My sincere apologies."`
`"No, it's okay.`
` I hadn't planned on sleeping in the first place.`
` ...What time is it now?"`
`Asked for the time, Genji checked a pocket watch that he took out of his chest pocket.`
`".........It is slightly after six o'clock."`
`Rosa gave her head a little shake as she realized that, even though it had felt like she had slept for a long time, not much time had actually passed.`
`...Even though she didn't feel rested at all, the drowsiness that wrapped around her felt very deep.`
`"Thank you, I'll be fine without the blanket...`
` I mustn't sleep at such a strange time.`
` My sense of time has been completely thrown off.`
` ..................The rain...`
`has finally come down, I see."`
`Rosa finally realized that the peaceful sound that had put her to sleep was actually the rain that had started falling.`
`"The wind is blowing hard, too.`
` ...Perhaps the typhoon is finally upon us?"`
`"......That is what they are saying on television.`
` The typhoon is moving slowly, and they expect it to be like this all throughout tomorrow."`
`"I see...`
` .........That wonderful rose garden, that must have been my last chance to see it."`
`From the window, what she could see of the rose garden was completely blurred by the wind and the rain.`
`"...Maria...`
` ......That's right, where's Maria?!"`
`"............I have not seen her.`
` I would think she has returned to the guesthouse."`
`Rosa knew her daughter's nature well.`
`{n}And a chill ran up her back.`
`Maria was stupidly straightforward, to the point that "stupidly" could be repeated seven times,`
` ......and if she was ordered to find something that didn't exist, she would look forever and ever.`
`......Even if rain was pouring down...!!`
`"......No.`
` The cousins left earlier, so Maria was alone...!`
` Unless someone told her to stop, she would stay there even if spears fell down from the skies!`
` Without even opening an umbrella!!`
` .........Aaaah, what have I done, losing control of my emotions!!"`
`As her mother, she had known about Maria's foolish straightforwardness better than anyone, yet she had once again lost control of her emotions, and done such a horrible thing...!!`
`"Mariaaaaaaa!!"`
`Rosa pushed Genji away and ran down the hallway.`
`The outside really looked like a typhoon, and was pouring down magnificently.`
`Maybe because of some figure of the terrain, the winds were not as strong as a typhoon, so an umbrella wouldn't be torn out of one's hands.`
`Even so, it was enough to call it a storm.`
`{n}There was no time to admire the roses being soaked by the rain.`
`"Anyway, I'm getting pretty worried about Maria.`
` .........You don't think she's still rebelliously searching for that rose alone, do you?"`
`"...I wonder.`
` Surely not with this much rain...`
`...is what I'd like to think, but Maria‐chan is sometimes really stubborn and foolishly simple."`
`We hadn't worried much, thinking that Auntie Rosa had taken her back to the mansion.`
`...However, it was concerning that Kanon‐kun had thought that Maria was here when he came from the mansion to call us.`
`".........I did not see her in the mansion, so I had assumed that she was here.`
` Since Rosa‐sama was taking a nap..."`
`"You didn't see her on your way over here?"`
`".........My apologies.`
` I opened my umbrella and ran as fast as I could, so I did not pay much attention."`
`If he had cut through the rose garden on the shortest line between the mansion and the guesthouse, then he would have missed the place where Maria had been looking for her rose by a little.`
`And it was raining this hard, too.`
`{n}There was a good chance that Kanon‐kun had failed to notice her.`
`"Enough debating around here, it'd be faster to just check it out directly.`
` ......Aniki, you up for a little race?"`
`"So you think that you can beat me now that you've had six years to grow?`
` Alright, let's find out.`
` ............Let's go!!"`
`George‐aniki and I flew out into the rain.`
`{n}Jessica and Kanon‐kun followed us.`
`"Mariaaaa!!`
` If you're there, answer me!!`
` Mariaaaaa!!"`
`"It's Auntie Rosa.`
` Auntie!!"`
`When George‐aniki called back, Auntie Rosa flew at him in what almost amounted to a tackle.`
`"Where's Maria?!`
` Isn't she with you?!"`
`"No, we haven't seen Maria‐chan since then."`
`"............Mariaaaaa!!!"`
`............Six years ago, Maria had been three years old.`
`{n}She had been a cute and pure kid who would just accept whatever anyone said.`
`...But six years had passed since then!`
`{n}She was nine now, and experiencing the good and bad parts of life should have taught her something.`
`......And yet, she's still just as innocent and pure as she used to be...?!`
`"Mariaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`As I circled the rose bed, something white unexpectedly turned to face me.`
`......It was a white umbrella.`
`Maria, holding a white umbrella, was crouching, still searching for that rose...`
`"............Uu."`
`Her face, which had turned bright red from her crying her eyes out, was dirtied with water and mud. It was a truly pitiful sight.`
`"You idiot,`
` ......are you still looking?!"`
`"......Uu......`
` Can't find it...`
` My rose...`
` ...Can't find it......`
` ...Uu......"`
`Maria had probably been here since the rain had started pouring down.`
`{n}It looked like her shoulders were freezing.`
`She looked tired to the bone, but fortunately, since she was holding an umbrella, she was not completely soaked.`
`...It was probably an umbrella from the handbag that Maria was always walking around with.`
`.........Thank goodness.`
` Seriously, thank goodness.`
`"Battler‐kun!`
` Thank goodness, you found her!"`
`"Mariaaaaaaaaa!!`
` I'm sorry, I'm so sorry...!!"`
`Auntie Rosa threw her own umbrella away and hugged Maria.`
`"......Uu.........`
` It's not here.`
` ...My rose isn't here...`
` ......Uu......"`
`"Mama will look for it with you later...`
` Okay?`
` So just let it go for today.`
` ......Okay?"`
`"............Uu...`
` Let it go for today........."`
`It looked like Maria still wasn't able to accept it, but she no longer had enough energy left to resist.`
`Jessica and Kanon‐kun caught up with us.`
`"......I'll have a towel ready in the mansion immediately."`
`"Maria......`
` Were you here the whole time......?"`
`"I'm sorry......`
` I'm sorry for being such a bad mother........."`
`"......Auntie Rosa, why don't we head back to the mansion for the time being.`
` Maria‐chan will catch a cold like this."`
`".........You're right.`
` Maria, let's go.`
` If we don't get you cleaned up, Grandfather will get mad at you."`
`"Uu...`
` I'm hungry."`
`"It's already time to eat.`
` You did a good job searching.`
` Once the weather gets better, we'll all go search together."`
`We couldn't stay in the rain forever.`
`{n}We took Maria with us as we headed back to the mansion.`
`Maria apparently wasn't as weak as I had thought.`
`When she remembered that dinner was calf steak, she started chanting "I'm hungry, hungry, uu‐uu!", and returned to her usual healthy self.`
`......Auntie Rosa didn't chide Maria on her "uu‐uu".`
`"So that's it.`
` You had an umbrella.`
` You sure are good at packing the right stuff."`
`"......Uu.`
` I didn't bring an umbrella.`
` Uu."`
`"What? Then how did you get that white umbrella you're holding?"`
`"Uu!`
` Borrowed it!"`
`It seemed that some caring person had brought her an umbrella.`
`{n}A normal girl would look for shelter once it started raining, but there was no way Maria's stubbornness would be broken by something like that.`
`...So maybe that person gave up recommending that she find shelter, and at least brought an umbrella for her.`
`"Really?`
` I will have to thank them.`
` Who was it?"`
`"Uu!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}~!"`
`The name that Maria mentioned very happily was that of the island's witch.`
`Rosa took a deep breath and asked again, trying to avoid hurting Maria's feelings now that she was happy.`
`"Really? That's nice.`
` So, who was it...?`
` The person who brought you that umbrella?"`
`"Uu.`
` {f:5:Bea}—`
`{f:5:trice}~!`
` Uu‐uu!"`
`Maria, who quickly picked up that her mother didn't believe her, made an angry face once again.`
`So Rosa stopped pursuing the subject.`
`{n}It looked like it would be faster to ask the person who had lent Maria the umbrella during dinner rather than ask Maria herself...`
`"Father.`
` Please at least join us for dinner.`
` It won't be a family conference like this."`
`Along with a dull pounding on the door, the sound of Krauss's entreaty could be heard.`
`However, that voice seemed to harbor a sense of resignation, that its sound would not reach its intended ears.`
`".........Kinzo‐san.`
` Won't you at least go out for dinner?`
` Haven't all of your children gathered here to see your face?"`
`"Silence, Nanjo.`
` ............So the bishop won't work.`
` ..................One move short......"`
`Apparently, Kinzo was completely focused on the final battle of his long‐lasting chess match with Nanjo.`
`His brow wrinkled, he continued to glare at the game board through his spectacles; Krauss's voice didn't reach his ears.`
`"............Kinzo‐san.`
` I am also hungry.`
` Won't you go down and eat?"`
`"In that case, you can go by yourself.`
` Let me consider this next move for a little longer.`
` ...We are going to finish it tonight."`
`"............Otherwise, it looks like this match will never in eternity be settled."`
`Nanjo stood from his seat, hoping this would prompt Kinzo to do the same, but Kinzo's eyes never left the chessboard.`
`He knew well that Kinzo always displayed a blind concentration when it came to chess,`
` but he had never seen Kinzo as focused as he was now.`
`...He was acting almost as though—just as he had said—if the game wasn't finished tonight, there would never be another chance for them to continue their contest...`
`Further attempts to persistently call him would surely not reach his heart.`
`Nanjo gave up and headed to the door that Krauss was still banging on...`
`The door to the study opened.`
`Krauss took a step back—surely Kinzo hadn't actually come out?!`
`But it was Nanjo who stood at the door; Krauss breathed a sigh of relief...`
`"......Doctor Nanjo.`
` Is Father..."`
`"...............I am sorry I couldn't be of service...`
` ...Kinzo‐san's world is nothing but this room now."`
`Nanjo shook his head with a completely defeated expression.`
`{n}Krauss raised his fist once more and banged on the door, shouting.`
`"......Father, can you hear me?!`
` We are heading down now, but any time you feel like it, please join us.`
` All of your children are waiting for you...!"`
`The voice was very loud, and the door was being noisily pounded on.`
`{n}There was no way that it wouldn't reach Kinzo's ears.`
`............It was reaching him.`
`{n}However, he was ignoring it anyway.`
`However, unlike the time he was being called down for lunch, he did not get into a rage.`
`{n}......Kinzo was now simply calm at heart, ...and it was almost as though he had attained peace by turning himself over to fate.`
`"......I am not interested in dinner, nor in my sons' faces.`
` ............I will only leave here when {f:5:Beatrice} is resurrected or when I am chosen as a sacrifice for the key...`
` The Demons' Roulette has already started spinning.`
` What meaning does dinner have at this point........."`
`As though the painfully loud banging on the door had completely failed to enter his hearing,`
`{n}Kinzo, in a state of total peace, silently thought about his next chess move...`
`Just as always, Kinzo was the only one missing from the dining hall.`
`{n}Krauss, wearing a bitter smile, returned with Nanjo.`
`"Just as always, Father is not feeling well.`
` He truly regrets missing this once‐a‐year opportunity to sit together with his gathered relatives."`
`Eva and Rudolf snickered.`
`Judging by Kinzo's character, he didn't regret it at all,`
` ...and none of his relatives regretted that he hadn't appeared either.`
`"Then why don't we start dinner.`
` Gohda, get it started."`
`"Certainly.`
` Well then, ladies and gentlemen, we shall begin."`
`Upon finally being told to begin the family conference dinner, his highlight scene for the whole year, Gohda nodded, grinning broadly.`
`"......Umm, I was wondering, who was it that lent Maria an umbrella?"`
`When Rosa timidly cut through the silence of the dining hall, everyone there turned their attention to her at once.`
`"...Umbrella?`
` What's this about?"`
`"Umm......`
` It started raining while Maria was in the rose garden a short while back...`
` It seems she borrowed a white umbrella from someone, and I wanted to thank them..."`
`"It wasn't one of us.`
` After you went out, Rosa, we changed rooms and continued our "friendly" chat the whole rest of the time."`
`"Haha, ...that's right.`
` Even after that, us siblings kept on with our friendly chat."`
`The word friendly fell awkwardly from Hideyoshi's lips,`
` so that even those that hadn't been there realized that it hadn't been a pleasant conversation.`
`"At the very least, it certainly couldn't have been me, Eva, Rudolf, or even Hideyoshi‐san or Kyrie‐san."`
`"We were together the whole time, even after Natsuhi nee‐san and Rosa‐san left.`
` The whole time until the meal started."`
`"Nii‐san went up to the study with Genji‐san to call Father.`
` At that time, the rest of us went straight to the dining hall.`
` So it wasn't one of us.`
` ...For a consideration like lending an umbrella, wouldn't it be one of the servants?"`
`"So, Gohda‐san?"`
`"......I have been in the kitchen the whole time preparing.`
` My sincere apologies..."`
`Gohda looked slightly disappointed about missing this chance to show off.`
`At that time, Shannon and Kumasawa appeared, pushing a serving cart loaded with hors d'oeuvres.`
`"Then perhaps it was Kumasawa‐san or Shannon‐chan?"`
`"...I'm sorry?`
` Ha‐have I made some mistake...?"`
`Shannon shrunk, mistakenly thinking that she was being accused of making some error, having come in partway.`
`"No, you haven't.`
` When Maria‐chan was alone in the rose garden, it started to rain.`
` Someone gave her an umbrella.`
` Auntie Rosa said that she wanted to thank that person."`
`"......Uu.`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice}..."`
`Maria, her mouth a thin line, said the witch's name in a small voice.`
`Auntie Rosa explained the situation one more time.`
`{n}As she did, Kumasawa‐san cackled.`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` It wasn't us.`
` Shannon‐san and I were preparing the rooms together, so we did not go outside."`
`"...Yes.`
` ......I apologize for not being able to help......"`
`"Preparing the rooms?`
` What do you mean by that...?"`
`"..................Because of this rain,`
` I thought that it would be difficult for all of the guests to return to the guesthouse,`
` so I ordered the servants to prepare the guest rooms inside the mansion."`
`"...Reeally? How thoughtful!`
` That's right, it would be rude to chase us outside in all this rain, wouldn't it?"`
`"Could you give it a rest..."`
`"Yes.`
` We received the order from Madam, and I, Kumasawa‐san, and Kanon‐kun were preparing the rooms.`
` ...Then it became time for dinner, and since we had received an order from Genji‐sama to go to the guesthouse and call the children,`
` Kanon‐kun left on our behalf."`
`"Yes.`
` In that case, did Kanon‐san find Maria on the way to the guesthouse and hand her the umbrella?"`
`"......Uu.`
` That's—not—it!!"`
`The person who had actually received the umbrella denied it.`
`{n}Rosa was troubled.`
`All she wanted to do was give a word of thanks to the person who had lent the umbrella, but she couldn't find them.`
`And she had thought that asking like this with everyone gathered for dinner would work immediately...`
`"...Then, Natsuhi nee‐san?"`
`"I'm sorry.`
` After my "friendly" conversation with everyone, my headache was so bad that I have been resting in my room.`
` Therefore, I did not go outside."`
`".........Then who?`
` George‐kun and the kids?`
` ......That can't be right."`
`"No, it wasn't us.`
` We were watching television in the guesthouse the whole time."`
`"Actually, we thought that Maria had just gone back to the mansion with you..."`
`"Then Kanon‐kun came, and he asked whether Maria was with us. That was when we first realized that she wasn't in the mansion.`
` In the first place, if it were me, before lending her an umbrella, I'd have grabbed her hand and pulled her under a roof."`
`Rosa was completely baffled.`
`{n}One by one, the relatives and the servants were claiming that it wasn't them.`
`{n}...Even though it really wasn't something anyone would need to hide.`
`With that, by process of elimination, the number of people it could have been wasn't large.`
`"Of course, it wasn't me.`
` Right after it began raining, I visited Kinzo‐san's room, and have been playing chess with him until just now."`
`"......Which means that it also wasn't Grandfather."`
`"Wait a sec...`
` Isn't this starting to get a bit weird?`
` Who's left?"`
`"Then, ...who?`
` ...Genji‐san?`
` Huh?"`
`"Um, wait a second, don't get me wrong.`
` It's not like I'm searching for some culprit or anything.`
` All I want to do is, as a mother, thank that person who gave Maria an umbrella in the middle of the rain......!"`
`...Giving an umbrella to a girl loitering in the rain was something to be praised, not hidden.`
`...Despite that, no one raised their hand.`
`......Why?`
`Everyone started whispering about how strange this had gotten...`
`"......Calm down, Rosa.`
` Why don't we just ask the person who borrowed the umbrella?"`
`An idea that everyone would agree makes sense.`
`{n}They were all scratching their heads at why she didn't just ask Maria, who had been given the umbrella.`
`However, Rosa bit her lower lip.`
`{n}After all, she already knew how Maria would answer if asked.`
`"Of course!`
` Rudolf‐kun here's got it right.`
` Maria‐chan, tell your uncle!`
` Who lent you the umbrella?"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}!"`
`The dining hall was wrapped in silence for an instant, but that soon broke and it was wrapped in laughter.`
`"Hahahaha.`
` I see, {f:5:Beatrice}, the witch of the forest, felt pity and lent her an umbrella.`
` What a nice story.`
` Rosa, there you go."`
`"......nn...`
`.........nnnn."`
`Rosa didn't seem satisfied.`
`{n}...She just wanted to say thanks for the umbrella; why did everything have to be so clouded in smoke...`
`"Uu!`
` Just like Uncle Krauss said.`
` {f:5:Beatrice} lent it to me!`
` Uu‐uu!"`
`"Hahahahaha...`
` Isn't that wonderful.`
` Oh, innocence, such an enviable thing.`
` Don't you all agree?`
` Hahahaha..."`
`Krauss was laughing with a face that was clearly mocking her,`
` but Maria, apparently feeling that her claim was being believed, was overjoyed.`
`"......What's going on?`
` Don't tell me a witch really appeared and lent her an umbrella?"`
`Jessica asked me in a small voice that wouldn't carry over to Maria, who was sitting across from me.`
`"Has Maria ever been the type to joke?"`
`If we had heard that kind of story pop out of that old bastard's mouth, we'd have just taken it as another joke.`
`......However, coming from Maria's mouth, it became somewhat inexplicable, strangely unsettling...`
`"No way.`
` She's always been frank and serious.`
` Hasn't she always just swallowed up jokes that were supposed to be obvious lies?`
` I've never even heard of her cracking a joke."`
`Auntie Rosa probably knew that better than anyone.`
`{n}It appeared that because of this weird situation, she had no idea what was going on anymore.`
`"So, if Maria says that she borrowed an umbrella from {f:5:Beatrice}, that definitely was {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`".........We're talking about Maria here, so I can't imagine it was some kind of metaphor or joke.`
` ...It might be best to take what she says at face value."`
`"Then what's going on?`
` Are you saying that Genji‐san or someone put on that fancy dress from the portrait and gave Maria the umbrella?"`
`"...I have no idea...`
` Actually, that's what I want to know."`
`Jessica shrugged jokingly, but her expression wasn't completely joking.`
`Once the hors d'oeuvres were set out and Gohda showed off his vast store of knowledge, the meal began.`
`A couple casual chats broke out here and there, but they seemed somehow distant; it was a quiet dinner, granting no respite from the intrusive sound of rain that was creeping into the dining hall.`
`Kumasawa and Shannon, pushing the serving cart, ran into Genji and Kanon on their way to the kitchen.`
`"...Genji‐san, were you the one who lent Maria‐sama an umbrella?"`
`".........Umbrella?`
` What are you talking about?"`
`"Right.`
` ......I heard that when it started raining, Maria‐sama was alone in the rose garden.`
` ...And it seems that she borrowed an umbrella from someone there,`
` but we don't know who it was."`
`"......It wasn't me.`
` After all, I thought that Maria‐sama was in the guesthouse.`
` When Battler‐sama first found her, she was already holding a white umbrella."`
`"My apologies, but it was not me either..."`
`".........Then, you don't think it was...`
`...the Master,`
` possibly?"`
`Everyone in both the dining hall and the place where they were standing now had stated that it wasn't them.`
`...Which meant that only Kinzo was left, but...`
`"Maybe he went walking down the corridor for some reason, when, by coincidence, he saw Maria‐sama in the rose garden without even an umbrella..."`
`"...............The Master...`
`does not particularly like Maria‐sama."`
`"I agree.`
` ............I can't imagine that, just for Maria‐sama, he would trouble himself to go all the way down the stairs to carry an umbrella to her directly."`
`"Oh, my......how troublesome.`
` So that means that the one who lent Maria‐sama an umbrella really was {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama?`
` Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho..."`
`Kumasawa laughed, just like the relatives in the dining hall had laughed it off.`
`{n}......She couldn't think of any other way to break through the smoke veiling the current situation.`
`Just then, the crisp sound of hands clapping twice rang through the hallway.`
`They all turned around at once to see that it was Gohda, who was coming out of the dining hall.`
`"Chop‐chop, everyone.`
` When serving a dinner, it is essential to make sure the dishes are served with the proper timing.`
` Please immediately see to setting out the soup.`
` Genji‐san, the women are in the middle of an important job, so please don't get in their way."`
`"........................"`
`Kanon glared at Gohda for being rude to Genji, a person Kanon respected.`
`Genji, realizing this, patted Kanon once on the shoulder as if to warn him.`
`Kanon reluctantly turned away, and returned his expression to normal.`
`"......Obey Gohda's order.`
` Let us now hurry to prepare the dinner table."`
`"Come on, we have no time.`
` Don't just dawdle around!`
` Hurry...!"`
`Gohda grabbed the serving cart from Shannon and drove it past her, heading towards the kitchen at pace.`
`"...Then please allow us to return to the kitchen.`
` ...After all, Gohda‐san's patience is very short, ...hoh‐hoh‐ho."`
`"Ple‐please excuse me as well..."`
`Kumasawa and Shannon left.`
`{n}Only Genji and Kanon remained.`
`{n}Through the window, the darkness of the rainy night could be seen, along with the occasional thunderbolt.`
`"............Genji‐sama.`
` Has {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama really...`
`......returned?"`
`"...........................I don't know."`
`"......Should we inform the Master?"`
`"There's no need.`
` .........If she has truly returned, she will eventually appear before the Master of her own accord.`
` .........Furthermore, she is a fickle person.`
` It would be pointless to report to the Master only to find that she does not appear..."`
`"..................I wonder if this means that the Master's ritual has already begun."`
`"...Probably.`
` However, that has nothing to do with furniture like us.`
` ......We must return the favor that we received from the Master...until our final moments."`
`".........Yes.`
` ...As furniture, that is our...`
`............duty."`
`The thunder crashed once more.`
`Except for that instant when the lightning lit up the sky, all that could be seen out of the window was the darkness of night.`
`Just as humans rule when the sun is up, the time when the sun is down is ruled by those that are not human.`
`The darkness of night that now surrounded Rokkenjima was ruled not by the Ushiromiya family, but by another master.`
`Did this master take pity on Maria when she was alone and pummeled by the rain in the rose garden, and lend her an umbrella...?`
`Kanon looked at the rose garden's lights, dimly visible beyond the window.`
`{n}The dim lights were not enough to illuminate the surrounding area.`
`Looking at those lights felt like making eye contact with the witch, and Kanon forcibly averted his gaze.`
`...If he didn't, it felt like his eyes would be absorbed by that light......`
`Perhaps the weather was also a factor.`
`{n}You often hear stories about how things like atmospheric pressure can influence people's moods and physical health.`
`For some time now, everyone had been making periodic attempts to clear the gloomy atmosphere,`
` but any conversation was quickly cut off, and in the end the dining hall was simply buried by the sound of the rain.`
`Dessert was some kind of chocolate cake accompanied by pear sherbet.`
`Gohda‐san enthusiastically explained the recipe as if delivering the coup de grace, but I quickly forgot the details.`
`The guest of honor, Grandfather, was absent; the weather was horrible; and the person who had lent Maria the umbrella was still a mystery.`
`When dinner ended, no one felt even one bit refreshed.`
`...It was too late now, but I realized painfully that taste wasn't the only important part of a meal. The whole atmosphere was also critical.`
`Gohda‐san, the supposed conductor of this performance called dinner, did his best to enliven the place,`
` dropping little jokes left and right, but it seemed they didn't quite get there.`
`After taking orders for after‐dinner coffee, tea, and orange juice, he left for the kitchen.`
`As soon as he disappeared, Uncle Krauss spoke.`
`"......My, my.`
` How truly irksome that this dinner, which Gohda worked so hard to create, has been so poorly received."`
`".........Yes, seriously.`
` It feels like nothing would taste good today. It's just that kind of mood."`
`"Hoh.`
` I would love to hear why you feel that way.`
` Sometime later, allow me, as your older brother, to help cheer you up."`
`Auntie Eva grimaced slightly.`
`{n}...I had already heard that she was not on good terms with Uncle Krauss, but now I could clearly feel it.`
`When I looked around, I noticed that my dad and Auntie Rosa were also grimacing.`
`Anyhow, it looked like there was something besides the weather that was troubling all of them...`
`"......Auntie Eva and my dad,`
` ...they both look like they're in a bad mood."`
`"Really?`
` I don't think so."`
`I asked Aunt Natsuhi, who was sitting on my right, ...but it looked like she was also in a bad mood.`
`She snapped back as though she was absolutely not interested.`
`"Well, our adult conversation got a little complicated.`
` It's not somethin' kids like you need to worry about, Battler‐kun.`
` Hahahahaha,`
` right? Natsuhi‐san? Kyrie‐san?"`
`Uncle Hideyoshi laughed as he spoke, but without his usual brightness,`
` so I could vaguely imagine just how complicated their adult conversation had actually become.`
`On top of that, even Aunt Natsuhi and Kyrie‐san, the people he had directed his comment to, ignored him as though they hadn't heard anything.`
`...I didn't know what kind of conversation they had been having while we kids were away,`
` but it reminded me of how Dad had said he had stomach cramps when we had arrived at the mansion.`
`The family conference might have been a playful reunion to us kids, but it was definitely different for the adults...`
`After Uncle Hideyoshi was ignored by the other adults, an awkward silence fell over the room; Kyrie‐san spoke up.`
`"......We were talking about how the kids' careers would turn out.`
` What will you do in the future, Battler‐kun?`
` Just drift on to college?`
` Wouldn't that be a little disheartening as a starting line for the long race of life?"`
`"Hey! Wait a sec...`
` Kyrie‐san, if you start talking about something like that in the middle of a meal, it won't digest well and we'll all get constipated, ri~ght?"`
`"Wahahaha...!`
` That's right, that's right! We were talking about Battler‐kun and Jessica‐chan's careers!`
` You can't take the future too seriously!`
` Wahahaha..."`
`Hideyoshi heartily agreed as if they really had been talking about that, but they probably hadn't.`
`Kyrie‐san had obviously been trying to avoid talking about something.`
`{n}However, if Kyrie‐san had determined that this was the best course of action for now, then she was probably right.`
`Taking this into account, I decided to cast aside my suspicions as to the cause behind Auntie Eva and Dad's bad moods...`
`At long last, the serving cart returned, filled with coffee and tea.`
`Kumasawa‐san and Shannon‐chan served it to everyone.`
`{n}Gohda‐san then explained that, with this, tonight's dinner was over.`
`If I had been able to eat in a more cheerful mood, it might have been the best dinner of my life.`
`It was a shame that this greatest of dinners couldn't have been had under the greatest of conditions.`
`"Uu!`
` George onii‐chan, is dinner over now?`
` Over?"`
`"Yes.`
` We're all done now."`
`"That's not ladylike.`
` Stay in your seat, and calmly drink up."`
`"...Uu."`
`Maria looked like she was really excited about the occasionally crashing thunder.`
`{n}Maybe she wanted to quickly finish eating and run over to the window.`
`{n}She had been fidgeting for a while, waiting for the meal to end.`
`......Some people are afraid of thunder, while others find it interesting, and Maria was apparently one of the latter.`
`So, when she heard from George‐aniki that dinner was over, a huge smile broke across her face.`
`She then stood from her seat, took out her handbag—which she had set under her seat, never having left it even while she was eating—and began fishing around inside of it.`
`No one seemed particularly concerned with this behavior...`
`".........What's...`
`that?`
` Where did you get it?"`
`George was the first to notice it.`
`{n}As he spoke, Battler also noticed.`
`When they looked, they noticed that Maria was now holding a beautiful Western‐style envelope.`
`On the front of the envelope, the Ushiromiya family crest—the One‐winged Eagle—was done in gold leaf.`
`Furthermore, it was sealed with dark red wax, imbuing a level of class upon it that made it clear that this was not something that Maria should be carrying around for fun.`
`"......Maria‐chan, what is that?"`
`It seemed that Natsuhi had also noticed the strangeness of the envelope that Maria was holding.`
`{n}Because her voice sounded too serious to be admonishing a small child, the other relatives around her finally noticed.`
`"What's up, Natsuhi nee‐san?"`
`"............What is...`
`that?"`
`"Maria...`
`where did you pick that up...?"`
`"That envelope has...`
`...Kinzo‐san's......"`
`As Nanjo muttered that, even us kids could understand why everyone seemed to be frozen solid.`
`The envelope that Maria held was one of the Ushiromiya family head's custom‐made envelopes for private use.`
`......In other words, it could only mean one thing.`
`{n}This envelope contained a message from Kinzo.`
`"Hoh.........`
` ...What is an envelope like that doing here...?"`
`"......It, ......it looks like something interesting has jumped out at us."`
`".........J‐just let me have a peek...!"`
`"Uu!!`
` No, I'm reading it!`
` I was told to read it to everyone!!"`
`Uncle Hideyoshi tried to snatch the envelope out from Maria's hands, but she protected it as though hugging it, and didn't let go.`
`"Hideyoshi nii‐san, you shouldn't take something from a child by brute force.`
` .........Maria‐chan, where did you get this envelope?"`
`"Uu!`
` Got it from {f:5:Beatrice} when she gave me the umbrella.`
` She told me to read it to everyone after the meal was over!`
` I'm the witch's mes—`
` mess—`
` "messenger"!`
` Uu!"`
`"Messenger...?`
` Ihihihi, the witch of the island sure likes to mess around."`
`Battler tried to joke about it, but no one went along with him.`
`"..................I, I wonder what's written inside of it. Maria‐chan...?"`
`"Uu.`
` Reading!`
` Uu!"`
`Maria casually opened the envelope.`
`...It was sealed only with wax, so she just had to remove the sealing wax to open it.`
`...That sealing wax fell onto the desk.`
`{n}Hideyoshi hastily picked it up and stared fixedly at it.`
`He then set it in the center of the table, where Natsuhi, Kyrie, and Nanjo glared at it.`
`Imprinted there in the sealing wax was the One‐winged Eagle—which was the Ushiromiya family crest, and also Kinzo's personal crest.`
`"............This is the family head's personal crest..."`
`".........I know because I have received letters from Kinzo‐san before.`
` Without a doubt, this is Kinzo‐san's wax seal."`
`"But, in this mansion, couldn't there be several identical seals?`
` For example, if there was some kind of stamp for wax seals, couldn't someone other than Kinzo‐san have sealed it?"`
`"No, Kinzo‐san would always use a ring on his finger, his "Proof of the Ushiromiya Family Headship", when he sealed the wax.`
` This shape and complex design is definitely Kinzo‐san's seal..."`
`"That is not necessarily so.`
` Anyone in the family must have received a letter from Dad at least once.`
` We can't eliminate the possibility that someone, using that wax as a model, created a fake seal to pass themselves off as Father."`
`"I agree with Aniki.`
` No matter how the seal resembles Dad's, we can't prove that it is the real thing.`
` Therefore, it doesn't prove that this envelope came from Dad."`
`"I feel the same way.`
` I cannot approve of arbitrarily deciding that this is Father's letter only by the seal in the wax.`
` Doctor Nanjo, would you mind refraining from speaking such vague words...?!"`
`"............I apologize...`
` I said too much..."`
`One after another, all of the siblings, from Krauss on downwards, rejected Nanjo's statement, saying that the envelope that Maria was holding had not necessarily been sent by Kinzo.`
`They were afraid.`
`Kinzo's intentions were written in there,`
` and they feared from the bottoms of their hearts that it might be some decidedly unfavorable announcement regarding the inheritance.`
`"...Maria...`
` The person who gave you that envelope was the same person who lent you that umbrella, right...?"`
`"Uu!"`
`"I don't know what "uu" means!`
` Is it true?!"`
`"Uu...`
` ......Yes.`
` Uu."`
`"So, in other words,`
` ...the witch,`
` {f:5:Beatrice}, gave you that envelope along with the umbrella...?"`
`"Uu!"`
`Maria nodded forcefully.`
`"...I, I agree with my husband.`
` It's a dubious letter handed over by some suspicious person.`
` It's not even worth reading."`
`"Oh, go on, what's the worst that could happen, right?"`
`Battler said it to Jessica in a small voice, pretending to stir things up, but Natsuhi heard him clearly and glared at him with threatening eyes.`
`"A‐and then,`
` err,`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice} told you to read it after the meal was over, right?"`
`"Uu!"`
`".........Why not, everyone.`
` This isn't Grandfather's envelope, it's {f:5:Beatrice}'s.`
` Who cares who wrote it, why can't we just hear what's inside before passing judgment?"`
`"Th‐...that's right.`
` Even if Father didn't necessarily write it, I'm still concerned about its contents.`
` ......Maria‐chan, I'm sorry I tried to take it from you by force earlier!`
` I apologize, so will you read it aloud in front of everyone?"`
`"............Maria.`
` Read it."`
`"Uu."`
`As all of the relatives stared fiercely at Maria, she spread the letter open with a rustle...`
`"......Do you think it really is Dad's letter?"`
`"Impossible.`
` Whenever Father has announced something to us in the past, if he didn't do it directly, he would always send Genji‐san, right?`
` ......I can't believe that he would use such a joke‐like approach."`
`"That's right.`
` Maria, a messenger?`
` That's seriously not his style...`
` Rosa, this must be Maria‐chan trying to surprise us with some kind of hidden talent, right...?"`
`"I..................M‐Maria's not a kid capable of something so clever."`
`"Reading.`
` Uu."`
`The words came out of Maria's mouth, but for some reason it felt like her voice was different than usual.`
`Everyone went suddenly silent...`
`"Welcome to Rokkenjima, ladies and gentlemen of the Ushiromiya family.`
` I am {f:5:Beatrice}, the alchemist for this family, under the employ of Kinzo‐sama."`
`".........How absurd...!"`
`"Quiet!"`
`"I have served him for many years in accordance with our contract, but today, Kinzo‐sama has announced the termination of that contract.`
` Therefore, I ask that you acknowledge my resignation from the position of family alchemist as of today."`
`"......How foolish... What nonsense...!"`
`"I, I can't stand to listen to it...!"`
`"And now, there is one part of the contract that I must explain to you all.`
` I, {f:5:Beatrice}, lent Kinzo‐sama a vast quantity of gold under certain terms.`
` One of these terms specifies that all the gold is to be returned to me upon the termination of the contract.`
` Furthermore, I am to receive everything of the Ushiromiya family as interest."`
`"R‐ridiculous!!"`
`"...I‐it's been ridiculous from the very beginning..."`
`"So it's basically one of those things, right?`
` Just like one of those contracts with the devil you always hear about?`
` And, the contract has expired, so she's come to collect the interest.`
` Is she trying to grab some retirement money for her old age or something?`
` What a cheeky witch."`
`"Battler‐kun, now is not the time to joke around..."`
`Battler made a face as if to ask, "If I can't make fun of this, what can I make fun of?"`
`At the same time, some of the adults' faces were pale, while others looked completely shocked.`
`"After hearing this, you may feel as though Kinzo‐sama has been savagely ruthless.`
` However, Kinzo‐sama did append a special clause to the contract so that you would have a chance to preserve your wealth and honor.`
` If and only if that special clause is fulfilled, I will lose my rights to the gold and the interest for all eternity."`
`"......A special clause...?"`
`"Wh‐what is it...?!"`
`{e:070:Special Clause.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} has the right to collect the gold and accumulated interest upon the termination of the contract.`
`However, if someone is able to discover the hidden gold of this contract,`
` {f:5:Beatrice} must abandon these rights for all time.}`
`{e:070:......The collection of the interest will proceed shortly, but if any one of you fulfills the terms of this special clause,`
` I shall return everything, including the portion that has already been collected.`
`Furthermore, as the first step in this collection of Kinzo‐sama's debt, I have taken possession of the "Ushiromiya Family Head's Ring", which signifies the passage of the Ushiromiya family headship from one individual to another.`
`I ask that you confirm this for yourselves by examining the imprint on the wax seal.}`
`".........You want me to accept this as real...?!`
` That Dad would relinquish his ring is unthinkable...!"`
`Krauss was staring at the sealing wax as though he was trying to burn a hole through it.`
`{n}Eva and Rudolf were doing the same over his shoulder!`
`"I, I did have the odd feeling that something was missing from Kinzo‐san's finger when we were playing chess........."`
`"Doctor Nanjo!`
` Don't say something so careless just because of a vague memory!"`
`"We can't prove its authenticity here.`
` The questions of whether Father really has handed over his ring, and whether this letter tells the truth, we can determine simply by asking him directly."`
`"Th‐that's right.`
` It's just as Kyrie‐san says..."`
`".........Well now, I wonder.`
` Will Kinzo‐san answer you...?`
` After all, that person's thoughts are sometimes impossible to predict using common sense..."`
`"In any event, this does not leave the realm of nonsense...!`
` In the first place, the fiction of the gold is itself a deception by Father.`
` If you want to talk about nonexistent gold, leave me out of it!"`
`"But, you heard what the witch is saying, right?`
` About how the headship and all of the assets would be handed over to the one who finds the gold?`
` So, could this mean that {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is Father's legal advisor, or maybe in charge of his funds...?"`
`"W‐we can't possibly trust the kind of strange person who would entrust such a suspicious paper to a child!"`
`"Aniki... Time for you to open up.`
` Is it possible that someone you don't know is actually handling Dad's assets?!"`
`"N‐no, that's impossible!`
` As the agent to the head, I have total knowledge of all Father's assets!`
` There shouldn't be anyone who can manipulate them without me knowing it!"`
`"Then, there must be some assets that you do not have full knowledge of, mustn't there, Krauss nii‐san?"`
`"Absurd, there's no such thing!"`
`"..................Oh yes, there is.`
` One asset of Father's that you know nothing about."`
`"There is no way that something like that exists!!"`
`"No, it does.`
` ............That'd be Father's, no, {f:5:Beatrice}'s hidden gold!!"`
`"Let's put things in order.`
` In short, Dad has some trusted confidante that not even Aniki knows about.`
` Furthermore, this person has always been in charge of watching and managing the gold.`
` It's possible that this person is a dilettante of a very rich family who provided his financing in the first place through a mock devil's contract."`
`".........Could it be that this confidante, this {f:5:Beatrice}‐san, is trying to test which of the sons and daughters is most fitting to be financed by her gold?"`
`What Kyrie said was something that all of the siblings wanted clarified.`
`Upon reflection, they realized that during the time Kinzo's strange epitaph had been displayed in the hall beneath the portrait of the witch,`
` they had always whispered that the one who solved the puzzle would receive everything, ......yet no one had ever clearly stated it.`
`It was just something that everyone had hoped might be true.`
`{n}That had, right here, right now, been clearly expressed by {f:5:Beatrice}'s letter!`
`It clearly specified that everything of the Ushiromiya family would be given to the one who found the gold.`
`"Kinzo‐sama has already publicly displayed the location of the hidden gold within the epitaph under my portrait.`
` The rules apply equally to all who can read the epitaph.`
` If you discover the gold, I shall return everything to you."`
`"Tonight, I ask that you enjoy your battle of wits with Kinzo‐sama to the fullest.`
` I sincerely pray that this night will be both intellectual and elegant.`
` {nobreak:—{f:5:Beatrice} the Golden}."`
`"......Father, I know you can hear me!`
` Please respond!"`
`The door to Kinzo's study was being violently, violently beaten against over and over again like a percussion instrument.`
`The screams coming from the other side were Krauss's, Rudolf's, and sometimes Eva's voices.`
`It was the siblings, who were trying to intrude upon Kinzo's study to question him about the truth behind that mysterious letter.`
`Kinzo was eating.`
`An elegant tablecloth was set over the desk, and the fabulous dinner that had colored the table down in the dining hall was once again laid out.`
`Kinzo continued his meal in silence.`
`{n}...Shannon, taking away an empty plate, looked uncomfortably between the door being beaten on and Kinzo's face.`
`"...............Everyone is calling for you, but...`
`...what would you like me to do...?"`
`"...Leave it.`
` God values silence, and so do I during dinner."`
`"............Should I silence them?"`
`"There's no need.`
` It does not even reach my ears."`
`Kinzo coolly tasted his food.`
`Genji quietly lowered his head and took a single step back.`
`{n}...As he did, Kanon, who stood in reserve like a shadow behind and to the side of Genji, opened his mouth.`
`".........Maria‐sama seems to have received a letter from {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, so I assume they want to verify its authenticity."`
`"...Hahahaha...`
` .........That daredevil, she has started already?"`
`"............Come, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` There's nothing lacking in the coins that have been wagered.`
` Shall we enjoy this night to the fullest?`
` ......I have no intention of losing.`
` Your smile is mine for all eternity.`
` If I could see it one more time, I wouldn't regret losing my wealth, my honor, or even my life."`
`".........Well then, the roulette has begun to spin.`
` Which pocket will the ball fall into?`
` Noir? Rouge?`
` Or house takes all?`
` Come, you may begin, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I'll show you the power of miracles once more...!"`
`The strange letter that the witch had entrusted Maria with had wiped all memories of dinner from our minds.`
`Maria had been repeatedly barraged with questions by Auntie Rosa and the other parents,`
` and was now in the worst of tempers because no one would believe her.`
` Even when we kids tried to talk to her, she would just ignore us.`
`Our parents were all stirred up over the gold, firing back and forth about the distribution of the assets, and completely forgetting that we children were even there.`
`...Even though I'd already figured that they had been talking about this in the shadows,`
` I never thought they'd be this blunt about it, and at least to us kids it was a considerable shock.`
`...From what we could overhear, all of our parents wanted as much money as possible, as soon as possible.`
`Back and forth about Grandfather's inheritance.`
`{n}Back and forth about the distribution of the gold if it was found.`
`{n}About advance payments and cash.`
`......It was so despicable, I couldn't bear to watch, even though one of them was my dad.`
`...It looked like Jessica felt the same way.`
`We left our seats, although no one had asked us to leave, and went to hang out somewhere apart from the parents...`
`".........I see.`
` Now I really understand why Grandfather didn't want to show his face during meals."`
`"I am so disillusioned with our parents now!`
` The money, the inheritance!`
` How could they act like that right out in the open!"`
`"Well I'm already completely disillusioned with that old bastard.`
` There's no way I could think any worse of him.`
` Ihihi!"`
`"A‐and you think I'm not?!`
` But even so......that freakin' shocked me.`
` Shocked me to the bottom of my heart..."`
`Jessica looked down at the floor, irritated.`
`...She was always talking about how bad her parents were, but maybe she hadn't really felt that way deep inside.`
`I could realize that from the depths of Jessica's shock.`
`"......You are both minors and still being brought up by your parents, so you might not understand,`
` ......but getting money is neither a simple nor a pretty thing.`
` You are still minors, so I won't try to force you to understand right now.`
` ......But still, I'd like you to realize that your parents are just doing their best in their own way."`
`".........Oh great,`
` George‐aniki's gotten all mature."`
`"I know that you're working hard as a full‐fledged member of society.`
` ......But does that mean that when the conversation turns to money and assets and stuff, you're capable of turning into a shameless, greedy vulture, like our dads...?"`
`".....................If it would just be about me, then no, I wouldn't want to do that.`
` However, when your family and your employees, your subordinates and their families are all counting on you, ...there are some times when you must fight."`
`".........I hate that kind of fight.`
` That back and forth about Grandfather's inheritance, it just makes me wanna puke."`
`Jessica pretended to spit violently.`
`{n}...That harsh reaction made the depths of her pain very clear.`
`"...Let's stop talking about this.`
` All of this about Grandfather's hidden gold, about property and inheritance, is our parents' problem, not ours."`
`"I agree.`
` ......At the very least, I think that being considerate and staying out of the parents' way when they're talking is the duty of their children."`
`"......Hmph.`
` ...Where's the fun in that..."`
`Everyone knows the phrase "Adults are filthy",`
` ...but we had now seen that for ourselves, and that really did give us a shock.`
`George‐aniki was now pretty much an adult, and I had already been disillusioned with my dad in the first place, so the shock wasn't that big for us,`
` ......but it looked like it was different for Jessica.`
`It looked like the shock that Jessica had received was even bigger than I had thought.`
`.........This girl, she was always talking badly about her parents, but it looked like she hadn't changed at all on the inside since long ago.`
`...Even now, she was still a pure‐hearted and delicate person who couldn't doubt others.`
`I'm sure she respected her parents as much as anyone else does.`
`......And then her parents started joining in with all the other parents, right in front of us children,`
` going "money money inheritance inheritance, my money!", so it was no surprise that the shock of hearing that was so big...`
`"...Jessica‐chan.`
` Please don't start hating your mother and father.`
` ......I won't ask you to understand them, but at least don't hate them."`
`"I get it, just leave me alone a bit...!!"`
`Six years ago, I would have further taunted the dejected Jessica,`
` ......but even I have grown up over the past six years.`
`I realized that it would be better to leave Jessica as she was right now...`
`Jessica suddenly looked away sulkily and left the parlor.`
`...She probably wanted to be left alone for now.`
`{n}I could do nothing but wordlessly watch her back as she left...`
`"......Come to think of it, I wonder where Maria‐chan went."`
`"She's probably still huddled up on the floor in front of the portrait."`
`Maria, who truly looked up to witches, had expected that coming in direct contact with {f:5:Beatrice}, and receiving the letter as proof,`
` would be an event that would surprise everyone and make them happy.`
`However, the adults had doubted its authenticity, had not taken Maria's story at face value, and had thoroughly bombarded her with questions.`
`...Even I didn't find it hard to imagine how much that must have hurt Maria.`
`We couldn't speak to either Maria or Jessica.`
`...In the end, George‐aniki and I just abandoned ourselves to the sound of the falling rain in the dark night...`
`"I wonder what's happening with that typhoon.`
` ......Maybe there's some news."`
`George‐aniki walked over to the corner of the parlor where the television was.`
`He hadn't called me over, and I really couldn't have cared less where the typhoon was on the sea now.`
` So I didn't go over to the television, but instead loitered around the window.`
`"......The wind hasn't picked up that much here, but I wonder if it's horrible over the sea.`
` I did hear from the weather report that there was a severe storm warning."`
`"Ah, Kyrie‐san.`
` ...How's it going with you adults, lots to talk about?"`
`It looked like she caught the sarcasm.`
`{n}Kyrie‐san shrugged.`
`"...That stomachache of a discussion could continue all night.`
` It's very tiring."`
`"Well, all I can say is, I hope you enjoy playing vultures to Grandfather's property to your heart's content.`
` ...It's disgusting."`
`"I'll agree with you on that.`
` If I could just slip away like you, I would do it.`
` ...Unfortunately, I can't.`
` Even if I'm not allowed to speak.`
` It's not easy being a partner, you know?"`
`Kyrie‐san sighed, smiling bitterly.`
`Well, yeah.`
`{n}They probably won't let Kyrie‐san, who married into the family, speak.`
`Still, as Dad's partner, she has no choice but to stay by his side and support him.`
`......Being in the line of fire, she must be having to bear far greater mental pressure than me.`
`I wasn't going to apologize, but, realizing that I had spoken too harshly, I cut the sarcasm for the time being...`
`"So how does it look?`
` Are they still stuck on the topic of the mysterious witch, {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"......More or less.`
` They'd been piling up secret agreements for some time, hoping for some kind of agreement between the four of them on the distribution of Grandfather's inheritance after his death."`
`"...And now some unknown fifth person has appeared to make things even more complicated, so there's no way that'll make for a peaceful conversation.`
` One moment they're snarling at each other, the next they'll set up a common front.`
` ......Natsuhi nee‐san's not the only one getting headaches."`
`On the one hand, they all wanted a larger portion than the other siblings, so they were all rivals,`
` but on the other hand, they didn't want one yen to be snatched up by anyone other than the siblings, so they were also all allies.`
`I couldn't get her to tell me the details, but they were apparently arguing on and on about their ceasefire agreement and rules to prevent anyone from getting ahead,`
` the situations under which their portions would be protected, and what legal measures would be taken in a worst case scenario.`
`......By this point, my emotions had shot straight past disgust, and now I perceived them as a force to be reckoned with...`
`"So, basically,`
` {f:5:Beatrice} is like a saboteur sent by Grandfather.`
` ...He probably wanted to scare the hell out of his children for just talking about the distribution of the inheritance without him.`
` Ihihi!"`
`"Who is this {f:5:Beatrice}, I wonder?`
` If she is who she says she is, then she's a mystery that no one knew about until today, and she also knows about the existence of Grandfather's hidden gold.`
` Furthermore, she was even entrusted with the Head's Ring.`
` ...She must truly have been trusted by him."`
`"Well, obviously I don't think she's a witch riding around on a broom.`
` ......But she's surely a person mysterious enough to merit being called a witch."`
`"I just hope Maria‐chan will go into more detail about that.`
` ......Even though she's just a little girl, everyone has been just chewing her up over this.`
` They really scared her, and now we can't even ask her things she might have answered.`
` I wonder if those people have ever even read "The North Wind and the Sun"."`
`"What is for certain is that Maria received a letter from a person who took the name {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......Entrusting Maria with a letter and hiding away even now, when she could have just appeared and talked to us directly...she sure is shy for a mystery person.`
` Hahahahaha..."`
`"......Hey, Battler‐kun.`
` Do you think that someone called {f:5:Beatrice} actually exists?"`
`"Who knows?`
` It's probably just a false name, right?`
` Like she's Grandfather's representative, so she was permitted to take the name of the witch from his delusions?"`
`"No, that's not what I meant.`
` Right now, there are a total of 18 people here on Rokkenjima.`
` ......Do you think that there is a 19th person?"`
`Are there really a whole 18 people on this island?`
`{n}Wondering about that, I began counting on my fingers, and it really did come out to 18 people.`
`"Do I think that a 19th person exists, you say.`
` ......What exactly do you mean?"`
`"Just what I said.`
` ......It looks like the person who lent Maria that umbrella was not one of us 18.`
` Therefore, isn't it reasonable to think that a 19th person exists, and that this was the person who lent Maria the umbrella?"`
`"............Well, ......yes, I suppose."`
`"Then, where exactly is this person now?`
` At the very least, she must have been on this island when it started raining.`
` And since that time, the weather has become progressively worse, so taking a boat out would be pretty much impossible.`
` In that case, that person must still be on the island hiding from the rain somewhere.`
` ......And without being spotted by any of us."`
`".........Certainly, all of us have been randomly prowling around all over the mansion and the guesthouse, but no one has bumped into a 19th person."`
`"...Even so, this island is huge.`
` There might be other places to hide from the rain outside the mansion and the guesthouse."`
`At about this time, I began to realize what direction Kyrie‐san's doubts were taking us in.`
`Kyrie‐san was denying that a 19th person existed.`
`{n}......{f:5:Beatrice} was one of us 18.`
`...In other words, she thought that someone we knew well was using her name.`
`"If {f:5:Beatrice} really was as she described herself, this person would definitely be the most honored of guests.`
` The most honored of confidants, trusted by Grandfather.`
` ...There's no way that Grandfather wouldn't give that kind of person a warm reception.`
` She would surely have been ushered into the mansion.`
` However, we haven't seen anyone."`
`"Wait a second, isn't this line of reasoning a little too hasty?`
` Yes, no one spotted them, but that doesn't mean that you can deny the possibility that a 19th person exists, right?"`
`"Maybe, for some reason, they landed on the island stealthily and have been hiding ever since.`
` ......It's what they call the Devil's Proof.`
` It's easy to prove that something exists.`
` If this {f:5:Beatrice} appears in front of us all and says hi, then everything is resolved.`
` But it's impossible to prove that there is no 19th person."`
`"......Yes.`
` Battler‐kun, your way of reasoning isn't bad.`
` In the current situation, there's not enough information to either accept that a 19th person exists or deny it.`
` ......But if you flip over the chessboard and think of it that way, we can be nearly sure that the existence of a 19th person is impossible."`
`"Flip over the chessboard" was one of Kyrie‐san's favorite phrases.`
`{n}...I had also been influenced by those words, and used them myself from time to time.`
`When you get stuck trying to find a move in chess or shogi, by flipping the board over and looking at everything from your opponent's standpoint, you can often see a strategy that would give you the upper hand.`
`Derived from this, it means to think by putting yourself in your opponent's shoes.`
`"......Okay.`
` Let's say that that a 19th person called {f:5:Beatrice} actually exists.`
` That person must have managed, without being seen by anyone, to stealthily arrive on this island and remain hidden since then.`
` They had some reason for this, yes?`
` In that case, why did they then deliberately appear before Maria and hand her the letter?"`
`It really was a contradiction.`
`If they had some reason for hiding themselves,`
` then they should have stayed hidden the whole time, but they had appeared openly in front of Maria.`
`"Well......`
`...wait, Maria even said it.`
` Didn't she say that she had been made a messenger?`
` Since Maria was the youngest and looked the most innocent..."`
`"Why would they need a messenger?`
` If they just wanted a letter delivered to the family conference, they could have mailed it.`
` If they mailed it to each of the four siblings, they would be unable to ignore it.`
` There was no need for them to carry it themselves and secretly hand it over."`
`".....................That really...`
`......does sound pretty weird."`
`"In the first place, if {f:5:Beatrice} existed, and she wanted to make her presence known to everyone, then she could have just openly presented herself to all of us.`
` Despite that, she chose the vague method of appearing through a little girl called Maria‐chan, and only gave us an indistinct impression of who she was.`
` Contradiction.`
` Let's go a little deeper, shall we?"`
`"............She appeared in front of Maria, trying to give us the impression that a 19th person existed, and yet,`
` she still hasn't appeared before us and is hiding somewhere at this very moment.`
` The contradiction between these.`
` ......Keep it in mind, and flip over the chessboard."`
`"In other words, the question is: why would a person want to give the impression that {f:5:Beatrice} exists as a 19th person?"`
`"......If this person wanted to hide, then they wouldn't have made their presence known.`
` And if they wanted to show themselves, they wouldn't have used the roundabout approach of entrusting someone with a letter.`
` ......Which means...?"`
`"It's simple.`
` {f:5:Beatrice} is one of the 18.`
` That is why they are creating the illusion that there is someone outside of the 18.`
` ...A powerful suggestion of a 19th person."`
`"The only person who could profit from this would not be some 19th person in hiding.`
` It would be one of the original 18 people.`
` ......Of course, this reasoning is full of holes.`
` If you turn over even a few of its premises, it will simply fall apart.`
` But I think it is almost certainly correct."`
`...This was quickly starting to sound pretty creepy.`
`Who had lent Maria the umbrella and handed her the letter?`
`{n}All of the 18 had been ruled out.`
`{n}And yet, {f:5:Beatrice} was hidden amongst those 18.`
`What was that person planning, hiding their true form and pretending to be {f:5:Beatrice}...?`
`"I also suspected that it might have been Maria‐chan playacting, but the contents of the message were extremely complicated, so it's hard to think that Maria‐chan prepared it herself.`
` ......However, I can't deny the possibility that Maria‐chan is working together with someone."`
`"W‐wait a sec...Maria's a nine year old kid!`
` What on Earth could you suspect her of planning, and with who?!`
` And what about her serious, too honest, and obedient character?!"`
`"Yes, I also understand what kind of a person Maria‐chan is.`
` ......But I think that's exactly why it's possible.`
` That girl's a dreamer who looks up to and blindly accepts the existence of witches.`
` So if a person appeared in front of her and said they were the witch {f:5:Beatrice}, Maria‐chan would be so happy that she would just swallow it up, I think."`
`".........So you're saying that if someone disguised themselves by wearing that fancy dress from the portrait, tricking Maria wouldn't be that hard?"`
`"Of course, with that reasoning, all of us women would become the primary suspects.`
` ......Anyway, who did Maria‐chan encounter...`
` Asking her the details of that would be our best and closest key to solving this riddle."`
`"...But that key has been obstinately closed up inside her heart.`
` Everyone denied the existence of the witch without listening to her, and barraged her with too many questions about who {f:5:Beatrice} actually was.`
` ......Maria‐chan probably won't open her heart to the adults now."`
`In the dim hall, in front of the portrait of {f:5:Beatrice}, ......Maria was sobbing.`
`"......Uu...`
` Uu.`
` ...No one believes I met you!`
` ......Uu......`
`uu......`
` I showed them the letter you gave me, but they still don't believe...!`
` .........Uu......u...`
`u...`
`...hic...`
`hic!"`
`"Anyway, Maria‐chan's holding the key.`
` The key to whether {f:5:Beatrice} is one of the 18 people or a 19th person."`
`"...Maria is stubborn, you know?`
` That girl, when she gets angry, it's pretty hard to make her feel better."`
`"Battler‐kun, I think there's a higher probability of a kid like you cheering her up than an adult like me.`
` ...After she feels better, try asking her."`
`"......I know you don't care about all this back and forth on the distribution of the inheritance,`
` but don't you think this classic Western mansion mystery situation is exciting?`
` Who in the world is this person who gave Maria‐chan the letter?`
` ......It makes my intellectual curiosity tingle."`
`"Even while being made to sit through those boring money talks, you can call this exciting? You really are tough...`
` Adults are something else."`
`I shrugged, exasperated.`
`{n}...But I had realized.`
`She had noticed the dejection I was feeling because I had overheard our parents' turbulent discussion,`
` and was probably trying to turn my mood around.`
`...She had at least managed to make me feel good enough to hurl abuse.`
`......She wasn't my real mother, so I never felt like calling her Mom.`
`...But it did make me think "she's a real adult".`
`"Hey, brats, so this is where you were?`
` Kyrie, you really took your time fixing your makeup, didn't you?`
` From now on, I'll start wearing it too."`
`"I'm sorry.`
` A woman's makeup takes a long time.`
` ............So?`
` How has the discussion been without me?"`
`"Hehehe, I'm sure everything was all peaceful and harmonious."`
`Kyrie‐san poked the weak spot under my arm with her elbow.`
`"...We decided to take a break to cool our heads a little.`
` It looks like it'll last all night.`
` I could cry."`
`His way of talking hadn't changed, but he couldn't completely hide his fatigue.`
`...I couldn't say I was sympathetic, but he looked pitiful compared to his normal, energetic self.`
`"Still, that rain's just awful.`
` I really don't want to go back to the guesthouse.`
` It looks like Natsuhi nee‐san made preparations for us to spend the night here in the mansion.`
` What'll we do?"`
`"......We don't need to think about that until you're done, right?`
` If you run out of enough energy to head back to our room, then we can let them take care of us."`
`"You're right.`
` We can think about it later.`
` ......What about you, Battler?"`
`"If I stayed, I'd just get in the way.`
` I'll be nice and go back over there."`
`".........OK.`
` Will you go back soon?"`
`"I dunno.`
` It'd be lonely to head back by myself.`
` I'll head back with the rest of the kids as a group."`
`"Yeah.`
` That'd be good.`
` ...............So, Battler.`
` You won't just be going to sleep that easily, right?"`
`"Yeah, I'll probably be up talking with the cousins.`
` It feels like we might be up all night.`
` Is there a problem with that?"`
`"......OK.`
` If, when the adults' discussion is over, you are still awake, I want to have a little talk as a family."`
`"...A what?`
` That doesn't sound like you."`
`Apparently, Kyrie‐san was thinking the same thing.`
`{n}"What are you talking about?",`
` she asked him in a small voice.`
`...It looked like Kyrie‐san didn't have a clue what Dad was talking about either.`
`"......I want to talk to you about it as well.`
` ......I'll tell you later, so don't ask now.`
` Please."`
`".....................?"`
`I don't think there's anyone who ignores their family as much as this old bastard.`
`...And this was the guy that was asking us to have a talk as a family.`
`{n}......Both Kyrie‐san and I couldn't help but get wide‐eyed.`
`"Don't make that scared looking face.`
` I'm the one that should be scared.`
` ............I mean, ......"`
`At that point, he swallowed his words for an instant.`
`...I don't remember Dad being the kind of person to artificially drum up suspense.`
`"...You're freaking me out, Dad.`
` You've got your family all here right now.`
` Quit beating around the bush and spit it out."`
`"..................I'm probably...`
`......gonna get...`
`murdered tonight."`
`There was a huge crash of thunder.`
`{n}It must have been really close.`
`Dad's expression, brightly illuminated by the lightning, was burned into my eyes.`
`......Dad's face, which always looked so sure of itself and which always wore a taunting expression,`
` ......was, for some reason that I couldn't explain, strangely frail.`
` ............It was so worn out that he looked like a different person.`
`"Wh‐what...?!`
` ...What are you talking about, that doesn't sound like you!"`
`"*giggle*.`
` I agree.`
` What happened? You look so timid all of a sudden.`
` It's not like you."`
`".........I'm going to go fix my makeup.`
` Don't follow me."`
`Dad turned away, weakly.`
`...After that, only Kyrie‐san and I were left, still wide‐eyed.`
`"What the hell was that.........?`
` He's gonna get {i:murdered} tonight?"`
`"You don't think that mysterious letter scared him?`
` Hasn't he been watching too many serial murder movies?"`
`"..................Hmmm."`
`Kyrie‐san didn't answer my lighthearted words, and continued to stare at my dad's disappearing back...`
`"......Battler‐kun, when you told Rudolf‐san to talk about it, he left without telling us anything.`
` Even though he said that he had something to say to everyone, he didn't answer you.`
` Why?`
` ......Flip over the chessboard.`
` ............And when you do?"`
`"There's the contradiction that he said he wanted to talk but then couldn't.`
` ...What, can you see anything by looking from Dad's perspective?"`
`"......*giggle*.`
` Yes, I can see something.`
` He wants to talk about something.`
` However, he doesn't have the courage to bring it up.`
` So he actually means "In that case, chase after me, talk to me, and question it out of me".`
` He also means the opposite when he says "Don't follow me".`
` He actually means "Follow me and force me to answer."`
` ......Honestly, what a spoiled little child."`
`"Whaaaa?!`
` Are you sure that theory's OK?!`
` Th‐that's ridiculous."`
`"Heheheh, can great detectives deduce the emotions and feelings between men and women?`
` They can't, right?`
` Figuring out the feelings of the opposite sex is an even more advanced art than exposing the tricks in difficult crime cases.`
` If you ask me, romance novels have much deeper mysteries than masterpiece mystery novels."`
`"I, ...I see.`
` Is that how it is......"`
`"I'll be with that spoiled little child.`
` ......He normally loves to act tough, but tonight he's completely tired out from that heated discussion.`
` He probably wants someone to lean on at the moment.`
` And responding to that need is the duty of his partner."`
`"Hahh.`
` Sounds passionate.`
` Then I'll leave the old bastard in your hands."`
`"Yes, leave it to me."`
`As Kyrie‐san departed, I called out to her.`
`"......Huh?`
` What?"`
`"Um, I wanted to say thanks.`
` Thanks to you, my gloomy mood has cleared up a lot."`
`"That's good.`
` Communication is important."`
`After answering with a wink, Kyrie‐san followed after Dad...`
`Natsuhi could be found in the dimly lit hallway.`
`{n}Now and then, the thunder would crash, but this had no effect on Natsuhi's expression.`
`......Her expression was completely worn out.`
`The discussion that had just taken place between the relatives in the dining hall was repeating itself inside Natsuhi's mind...`
`{f:5:Beatrice} had proclaimed that in addition to the gold, the headship and all of the assets of the Ushiromiya family would be given to the person who could solve the riddle.`
`...In other words, she planned to undermine the absolute guarantee that Krauss, as the oldest brother, had to succeed the family head.`
`Originally, the other siblings had absolutely no chance to succeed the head.`
`To them, this "proposal" by {f:5:Beatrice} was extremely desirable.`
`It was obvious that they would accept {f:5:Beatrice}'s proposal.`
`...Even without playing clumsy detective games, she knew that this so called 19th person, {f:5:Beatrice}, couldn't exist.`
`This was a message employing a fictional character called {f:5:Beatrice} as a messenger; it may as well have been written in Kinzo's own handwriting.`
`The proof was that Kinzo remained stubbornly neutral as to that letter's authenticity.`
`......He was completely ignoring these reckless claims that he shouldn't be able to ignore: that he had given up the Head's Ring.`
`............In short, Kinzo had wordlessly admitted that the letter held his own message.`
`Most likely, one of the servants had given Maria the letter.`
`Kinzo had probably worked out an elaborate plan where the dress from the portrait would be prepared,`
` ......and someone, probably Shannon, would be made to wear it and deliver the letter and the umbrella.`
`By doing that, he could make it seem like the witch from the portrait actually existed.`
`...No, if anything, that is why you could be certain that Kinzo was behind all of this.`
`In that case, ......it was just as if Kinzo had butted in on the siblings' private discussion.`
`And, by announcing that he would give everything to the person who could solve the riddle, Kinzo had weakened Krauss's overwhelming advantage.`
`.........Now it was certain.`
`{n}Kinzo had listened in on the siblings' discussion in the parlor earlier that day.`
`So he had known how Krauss had staved off the attack by the other three,`
` and to make the scales of the battle go back into balance, he had sent out this strange letter which benefited the other three.`
`Eva and Rudolf had dragged Rosa in, who had a weak position among the siblings because of her age,`
` and they were trying once again to overwhelm Krauss three‐on‐one, and push through their crazy reasoning.`
`......And so, they had resumed what had once been a nearly decided conflict, and were repeatedly pressing Krauss to pay them a large amount of money...`
`Talk about the advance payment, which had been denied once already, was being brought up again under the terms that all of the siblings would guarantee Krauss the succession to the family head.`
`Of course, even without the story about the hidden gold, the Ushiromiya family's store of wealth was vast.`
`Just that store was worth more than enough by itself.`
`{n}Even if the hidden gold was buried forever along with Kinzo's death, there would be more than enough to satisfy.`
`Therefore, even if they had no interest in the gold itself,`
` there would be the lifelong fear that, on the off‐chance that someone found the gold, that person would be granted the position of family head.`
`And this kind of Achilles' heel would definitely be taken advantage of by someone sooner or later.`
`The only person with this fatal weakness was the successor to the head, Krauss.`
`{n}......The other siblings had found,`
` ...no, they had been told, by Kinzo, about something that only Krauss could lose, and they had thoroughly taken advantage of that.`
`...Natsuhi, as Krauss's only ally in his painful position, and as his wife, had believed she was fighting alongside him.`
`She kept trying to point out to him that the existence of the gold itself was a farce and that there was no need for him to compromise.`
`Krauss had always told Natsuhi.`
` He had told all of the siblings.`
`{n}He had always, always said that the hidden gold was nothing more than a fiction created by Kinzo.`
`Therefore, Natsuhi had believed that as his wife, and on that foundation had supported her husband.`
`Yet her words would not reach him.`
`...Even though she was fighting so hard and lending all of her strength, he continued to fight by himself, and was trying to compromise with the other three siblings...`
`Wondering why she could not be of use to him, Natsuhi felt sorrow, shame, and then anger.`
`It had happened when everyone decided to take a short break to cool their heads.`
`Natsuhi had flared up against Krauss.`
`Enraged, she had asked why she could not be useful to him.`
`......He had told her that he wanted to talk about something, and had invited her into one of his private rooms, which she was normally not allowed to enter.`
`That room had been sealed with a heavy‐looking padlock, and just looking at it had given her an uncomfortable feeling...`
`"There's no reason for you to worry about what those three or even this suspicious person who calls themselves {f:5:Beatrice} says!!`
` After all, the gold is just a ruse created by Father.`
` There's no way something like that could be found!!`
` It is set in stone that you will be the successor to the family.`
` What are you afraid of?!"`
`Krauss removed the padlock on the door.`
`{n}He then motioned for Natsuhi to enter.`
`"Enter."`
`"Wha‐......what is this?"`
`"There's something I want to show you.`
` ......I have never shown it to you before."`
`Natsuhi timidly opened the door with a dubious expression on her face...`
`It was pitch black.`
`She searched for a switch to turn on the lights, but since this was her first time in the room, she didn't know where it was.`
`Krauss entered behind her, pushing her in, and closed the door before making any attempt to turn on the lights; the two were swallowed up by the darkness.`
`Only the sound of Krauss locking the door rang out through the dark.`
`"Wh‐what are you doing...?`
` The, the lights..."`
`"I am turning it on now.`
` Wait."`
`True to his word, Krauss pushed a switch on the wall, and a flickering light turned on and lit up the room.`
`"...........................Wh‐`
`what is......?"`
`Natsuhi had her breath taken away.`
`The room had no windows, and at a glance, it appeared to be empty.`
`In the middle of the room, a small, round table had been set,`
` and the lights brightened only that table, as if it were the leading part in a play.`
`Laid out on top of the table was a red tablecloth of elaborate design, covered with dust,`
` ......and on top of that, "something" about the size of a grown man's arm had been set down.`
`......That something took Natsuhi's breath away.`
`"It's a gold ingot of incredible purity.`
` Without this, no one would have believed in the Legend of the Gold."`
`It was an ingot of solid gold.`
`Even in the faint light, it sparkled with a noble and dignified gold glint...`
`"This is not a proper ingot.`
` I don't even know whether it was cast inside or outside the country."`
`It takes a high level of skill to make the purest of solid gold ingots.`
`{n}And in order to verify that purity, it is standard to have the original foundry and the name of the bank that guaranteed it imprinted on the gold.`
`...However, this ingot did not have that kind of seal.`
`{n}.........This mysterious gold bar had come from an unknown foundry.`
`"Look here.`
` ............There's nothing to be afraid of.`
` It's just a bar of gold."`
`Natsuhi, following Krauss's words, timidly approached the ingot......`
`"Right there."`
`Krauss pointed at the surface of the ingot.`
`{n}...Natsuhi concentrated on that section...`
`".....................!!"`
`Right there was the thin imprint of the One‐winged Eagle crest!`
` Natsuhi's breath was taken away once again.`
`"That's right.`
` This is the legendary ingot that Dad said he received from the witch, that the president of Marusoo witnessed and was allowed to select at random to take back with him,`
` that gained the trust of the fixers in the business world.`
` I had to use all possible means to find it.`
` ......Before the other siblings could."`
`".........How could............`
` ......Then,`
` .........the legend of Father's gold is........."`
`"It actually exists.`
` ......The gold that Ushiromiya Kinzo received from {f:5:Beatrice} actually exists."`
`"How could...............!`
` H‐......how could it really exist............"`
`Natsuhi was shocked......`
`Krauss had always said that Kinzo's gold was just a fabrication.`
`{n}So she had believed it as his wife.`
`However, the reality was different.`
`{n}He had held definite proof, and had been more certain than any of the other siblings that the Legend of the Gold was true.`
`Because of this, Krauss was deeply frightened at the possibility that someone other than himself would find the gold that he had failed to find, costing him everything.`
`......But to Natsuhi, this truth was more than enough to split open her heart.`
`She had thought that, as Krauss's wife, she should be his closest confidant, which was why she had been selflessly supporting him.`
`...And yet, he had hidden this fact from her until today.`
` .........Why?`
`"......Ha‐`
`.........have I been...`
`.........so undeserving of your trust............?"`
`".........I didn't mean it like that.`
` It was only that there was no need to mention it."`
`"Is,`
` ......is that all a,`
` ............a wife...`
`means to you............?!"`
`"Calm down...`
` Becoming passionate easily is one of your bad habits."`
`"You're the one who's making me like that, aren't you!!!`
` I have been supporting you as a wife ever since I married into this family...!`
` For your sake, I threw away the family I was born into,`
` I've been offering up my heart and my body to serve you...!!"`
`"And in return,`
` .........I get this.........?!!`
` How could......`
` ............How could you............!!"`
`Krauss grimaced, looking annoyed...`
`{n}His expression effectively communicated how much he disliked this part of Natsuhi...`
`"......I.........`
` I don't think I can be of any use to you anymore............"`
`"Mm, and that is fine.`
` .........I can resolve problems between the siblings by myself.`
` I don't need your help."`
`"That's wrong!!`
` This is the Ushiromiya family's problem!`
` It's true that I am not permitted to have the family crest imprinted on my body!`
` But I am still your wife!!"`
`"Even so, ......are you saying I'm not qualified to help you...?!`
` Are you.........?!!!"`
`".....................I deliberately chose not to involve you, out of consideration for you.`
` Let's not talk any further; it will likely only worsen your headaches.`
` Take a rest for today.`
` The siblings will deal with the siblings' problems.`
` It has nothing to do with you.`
` That is all."`
`A dull headache tormented Natsuhi...`
`{n}No matter what medicine she took, no matter what scents she burned, it wouldn't heal.`
`......On the other hand, by standing here alone in a dimly lit corridor, her head filled with the sound of the rain, she felt like the pain had softened a little...`
`.........I may have been Natsuhi,`
` ...but I was not Ushiromiya Natsuhi.`
`Denigrated as being a sorry excuse for a wife, ...verbally abused for not even being able to take care of that,`
` .........even so, I tried to properly perform the duties of a wife,`
` ......but have been rejected even by my husband.`
`I did my best raising my daughter as though it was the last job left to me.`
`{n}...However, my anger and sadness, having no place to go, caused me to subconsciously strain that relationship too...`
`Because I have been excessively strict in Jessica's education, I am thoroughly disliked by her.`
`Jessica despises me for not being interested in anything but grades.`
`......There is no longer...`
`......anything I can do for the Ushiromiya family.........`
`No,`
` ......that's no good.`
`Even so, I must help my husband dislodge the schemes of the other greedy siblings.`
`The head won't be around much longer.`
` Eventually, Krauss will succeed the head.`
`{n}And the next successor will be Jessica.`
`.........Strictly speaking, the man who enters the family by marrying Jessica will become the next head, but it all comes to the same thing.`
`......I have to make Jessica an excellent successor who everyone will accept as worthy to take over the Ushiromiya family.`
`In the years to come, that greedy Ushiromiya Eva will surely be continually plotting to find some fault with the main family,`
` so that if all goes as she plans, Jessica will be dragged down from the succession, with George in her place.`
`......It is regrettable, but George is a man, and even more, has matured as a person.`
`...If you compare him to Jessica, who is right in the middle of her rebellious period and whose grades are below average, you can see at a glance who is more fit to succeed the head.`
`So in order to secure Jessica's position, I need to turn her into an excellent person.`
`After doing that, .........I want to find her an excellent husband worthy of the excellent person she will have become.`
`.........A wonderful man who will truly accept Jessica, and stay with her through all of life's joys and sorrows.`
`Was that...............Natsuhi trying to entrust her daughter with fulfilling some desire of her own?`
`Natsuhi thought back to the days when she'd had no choice but to marry into the Ushiromiya family, because of that unavoidable fate...`
`She had tried to block that from her memory.`
`.........She had consciously forgotten that, and had actively attended to the life she had been given as Ushiromiya Natsuhi...`
`And this was the new life she had built.`
`.........But, ...it felt like,`
` ......just now, all of that had been casually rejected.`
`"..............................`
` How should I think as I live my life?`
` ...............I don't know."`
`Natsuhi helplessly rested her head against the glass of the window...`
`The glass, cooled by the raindrops beating against it, was somehow refreshing, and even though it had no emotions, ...right then it seemed to be the only thing that could understand Natsuhi...`
`Even if someone showed up there and saw her like this, Natsuhi had no intention of caring in the least.`
`.........But she found herself caring.`
` .........Because it was her beloved daughter.`
`".........Oh,`
` ......it's you, Mom.`
` What the heck are you doing here?`
` Thought you were a ghost..."`
`Just like always, her words were rough and not at all like a girl's.`
`...Instinctively, words of rebuke rose to Natsuhi's throat.`
`{n}.........However, they did so only weakly, and so she was able to prevent them from escaping her lips.`
`"........................Jessica.`
` I'm sorry, your mother has an awful headache.`
` Please leave me be."`
`"..................Oh......"`
`Jessica was more than slightly disconcerted by this first ever sight of feebleness from her mother.`
`Until just now, she had been filled with contempt for all of the parents, including her mother.`
`...But now, not the slightest bit of that feeling remained.`
`......All of it had been wiped out by her mother's completely exhausted face.`
`In its place, the words that George had told her floated back up in her mind.`
`{n}The parents are doing their best in their own way.`
`...They are supporting their family, so they can't afford to keep everything pleasant, and have a heavy responsibility to fight.`
`......Couldn't her mother have been standing around in this dimly lit hallway because no one had tried to understand that...?`
`Jessica didn't like her mother.`
`{n}......So she had no instinct to give her mother words of kindness just because she looked a little frail...`
`Therefore, in order to give those words regardless, she had to clench both her fists, and wrench the words out from the depths of her heart.`
`"It, .........it looks like you really have your hands full with that discussion..."`
`".....................It has nothing to do with you.`
` Please go somewhere else."`
`".........Is your headache bad?`
` Should, should I go get some medicine...?"`
`"...............You don't have to trouble yourself.`
` ...Please, leave me by myself."`
`Natsuhi was not being cold to her.`
`{n}...She just wanted to get her daughter far away from her, so that she could avoid subjecting her to her short temper.`
`......But there was no chance that her intentions would reach Jessica.`
`".....................o......okay."`
`Jessica hung her head, looking sad.`
`...Looking at that expression, Natsuhi realized that Jessica was trying to muster up the strength to be kind to her mother.`
`She gave her head a small shake to drive away her own unkind feelings...`
`"Then I'll......leave.`
` ......I'll be with the other cousins so I don't get in the way of the adults.`
` ............See you..."`
`".........Wait."`
`She called Jessica, about to make her desolate exit, to a stop.`
`"......What...?"`
`"............Thank you for being considerate.`
` .........It isn't good of me to go to sleep and leave you alone."`
`"D‐don't talk like that, you'll bring bad luck..."`
`"...I apologize for worrying you.`
` I'm alright now.`
` .........I will go."`
`Staying here any longer with such a feeble expression would actually make her daughter feel more uncomfortable.`
`...Thinking this, Natsuhi left Jessica with words of gratitude and made to depart.`
`......This time, it was Jessica who called out to her mother's back.`
`{n}Natsuhi stopped, turned around, and asked what she wanted.`
`But Jessica herself didn't know why she had stopped her mother,`
` ...and for a while, she muttered to herself with a slightly forced smile as she hesitated over what to say.`
`She was poking around in her pocket when her hand touched something, and she took it out.`
`"Um, hey, Mom!`
` I, uh, was given a charm today.`
` What was it, a charm against magic?"`
`"Umm, err...... I'm pretty sure that...you were supposed to hang it from your doorknob, was it?`
` Ahahaha... I forget...`
` There's no reason for me to have it, so......`
`I'm giving it to you."`
`It was the scorpion charm that Maria had given her by the beach that day.`
`Although she had heard of its various effects from Maria, right now, Jessica's mind was blank, and it was all she could do to say even that much.`
`Thinking that her mother probably wouldn't accept the charm anyway, Jessica had immediately drawn back the hand offering it to her.`
`......So when Natsuhi came back and took hold of that hand, she was extremely surprised...`
`"......................What is this?`
` Some kind of giveaway...?"`
`"W‐well, it's, I think it's something like that...`
` I guess you can't expect any benefits from a charm that looks like a toy......"`
`But her mother took the scorpion charm from her grip.`
`"Thank you.`
` I'll take good care of it.`
` ............Sometime soon, in exchange, I'll give you a charm that was important to me when I was a child."`
`"...It, it's not like that's why I gave it to you.`
` ......But, well,`
` ......if you really say so..."`
`"Then I will rest for now.`
` My headache is awful.`
` .........Try not to stay up too late."`
`"Sure..."`
`Natsuhi put the charm in her pocket and turned away.`
`{n}......She then disappeared into the dark hall...`
`"...It looks like the weather will be like this all day tomorrow after all."`
`"Damn... It's hard to believe it was dry out earlier."`
`George‐aniki and I were killing time in front of the parlor television.`
`At that point, Jessica returned.`
`{n}Her face was still blank, but it looked like she had calmed down a little since she had left.`
`"......Is Maria still in front of the portrait?"`
`"Nope.`
` She just came back, and she's sleeping over there on the sofa.`
` It is getting pretty late for her."`
`Looking at the clock, it was a little past 10 p.m.`
`{n}...Even if we were going to stay up all night, it was about time to head back to our room.`
`"My mom did prepare a room for us in the mansion, but...`
`...what d'you wanna do?"`
`"I think I'd rather head back to the guesthouse.`
` ......Judging by our parents' appearance, I think it would be better if we weren't in the mansion."`
`"Second that.`
` Feels like they're telling us kids to mind our own business and stay out of their way.`
` Let's do that, like good little boys and girls."`
`After we discussed that, Auntie Rosa came into the parlor.`
`She was looking all over restlessly, probably trying to find Maria.`
`"Auntie Rosa, if you're looking for Maria, she's over there on the sofa."`
`"Thank you.`
` My, she's out cold.`
` ......We must move her to a bed."`
`"If you would like me to, I can carry her to a bed."`
`"Thank you, that would be wonderful.`
` .........Will all of you return to the guesthouse?`
` Or will you stay in the room Natsuhi nee‐san had prepared?"`
`"We were just talking about that.`
` We just decided to head over to the guesthouse."`
`"Really.`
` Then I wonder if you wouldn't mind taking Maria with you.`
` ...I think it will be much more comforting for her if she's with all of her cousins."`
`It seemed that, in the shadow behind those words, there was some regret that the adults, herself included, had deeply hurt Maria's feelings...`
`"Leave it to us, Auntie.`
` After all, we do have an expert at comforting Maria with us!"`
`"A‐are you talking about me?`
` I couldn't do it by myself.`
` We'll need everyone together."`
`"That's right.`
` Battler, weren't you the one who hit it off with Maria when you were messing around earlier?"`
`As we said this, Auntie Rosa smiled, looking truly happy.`
`"Thank you, everyone.`
` ......It looks like our meeting will last until very late.`
` So, I'm sorry for the burden, but I'll have to leave Maria in your hands."`
`"Hey, Maria, are you awake...?`
` We're going back to the guesthouse~."`
`Maria muttered something indistinct as if answering, but then rolled over and fell back asleep.`
`......It looked like she was sleeping deeply.`
`"She's really out cold.`
` It'd be bad to wake her."`
`"Right, I'll carry her."`
`Maria's body was much lighter than it looked.`
`{n}George‐aniki picked her up and pulled her over his back.`
`It was raining hard outside, and Aniki couldn't hold an umbrella and carry Maria at the same time.`
`It looked like Auntie Rosa would come with us as far as the guesthouse to help out.`
`However, when she heard Uncle Krauss's voice call out to her, she had no choice but to return.`
`"......Oh dear.`
` I have to go back."`
`".........Is everyone returning to the guesthouse?"`
`After we left the hall on the way to the entrance, the door to the servant room opened and Shannon‐chan stepped out.`
`"It has become very dark, so allow me to guide you."`
`"Perfect timing, Shannon‐chan.`
` George‐kun is going to carry Maria there.`
` Could you hold an umbrella for him?"`
`"Yes, certainly."`
`Shannon‐chan brought umbrellas for each of us and a flashlight to guide the way.`
`As we opened the front door, the downpour was quite terrific.`
`It looked like we wouldn't have any spare time to take a pleasant walk and enjoy the nighttime rose garden...`
`"Aniki, is she too heavy?`
` Want me to carry her?"`
`"It's alright.`
` I can at least carry Maria‐chan."`
`"......I'm truly grateful.`
` Please take care of Maria."`
`"Right, we understand.`
` In that case, goodnight, Auntie."`
`"Then I will see them over there and return here."`
`"Yes, please..."`
`Auntie Rosa saw us off.`
`".........Maria.`
` ......I'm sorry for everything..."`
`Rosa's mumbling voice didn't reach the person in question, nor anyone else, but disappeared beneath the sound of the rain...`
`After cutting through the rainy rose garden, we arrived at the guesthouse.`
`"Ahh, if only I'd applied for the position of Maria‐carrier!`
` Then I'd have gotten to rub Shannon‐chan's huge chest all over with my arm as she held the umbrella over me!"`
`"Th‐th‐th‐that's not on purpose, it's a misunderstanding...!"`
`"I, I thought that if I didn't, George‐sama would get all wet........."`
`"C'mon, quit babbling and go in!"`
`After being nudged by Jessica, Shannon folded up her umbrella and went into the guesthouse.`
`"Has anyone gotten their clothes wet?`
` I can bring some towels if you would like..."`
`"You don't need to worry about us that much.`
` Thanks, Shannon‐chan."`
`"Oh, yes.`
` We were saying earlier that we would play some cards, do you want to stay with us for a while?"`
`"Huh?`
` Who had the night shift on today's schedule?"`
`"I believe there is a special schedule for the duration of the family conference.`
` I think there were a few changes, so I will go and check......"`
`"Wait, if you have to go all the way back to the mansion to find out, you don't have to force yourself—"`
`"Ah, it's alright.`
` I can find out from the servant room in the guesthouse.`
` ......Please excuse me for a short while."`
`Shannon‐chan gave a quick bow and went into the guesthouse servant room.`
`The rest of us headed for the cousins' room and put Maria in the bed for the time being.`
`Maria was sleeping very deeply, and there was absolutely no sign of her eyes opening...`
`We got some drinks out of the room's refrigerator, and spent some time playing cards while drinking...`
`"......Oh?`
` Kanon‐kun?`
` Even Genji‐sama is here.`
` ...What is happening with tonight's shift...?"`
`"............Krauss‐sama has given an order.`
` There have been modifications made to most of the schedule."`
`"......Indeed.`
` Gohda has been changed to the night shift at the mansion.`
` You and Kanon have the night shift in the guesthouse.`
` Kumasawa‐san and I have been ordered to spend the night in the guesthouse...`
` We just now had a phone call stating that you are to remain here as well."`
`"Huh...?`
` Th‐that's quite a large modification...`
` The shifts at the guesthouse and the mansion have been completely reversed, haven't they...?"`
`Originally, Shannon and Kanon had been given the night shift in the mansion, while the night shift in the guesthouse, where all of the relatives were staying, had been assigned to Gohda, who had an abundance of experience in entertaining.`
`Kumasawa had been scheduled to stay in the guesthouse, while Genji had been scheduled to stay in the mansion.`
`However, it seemed that Krauss had suddenly ordered that the schedule be modified.`
`......The shifts at the guesthouse and the mansion had all been reversed, and Genji was spending the night in the guesthouse.`
`"............It's probably because of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's letter."`
`"Probably? ......Why?"`
`".........When such a mysterious letter appeared, it was only natural that Krauss‐sama would suspect one of us.`
` .........We serve directly under the Master, so Krauss‐sama probably wanted to keep us as far away from the family conference as possible."`
`Genji, Shannon, and Kanon were all permitted to wear the Ushiromiya family crest, the "One‐winged Eagle", as the servants who served directly under Kinzo.`
`Of course, since they were working for the Ushiromiya family, they had to obey anyone's orders, but their only boss was Kinzo.`
`Since only Kinzo held the right to employ them, even Krauss could not have them dismissed of his own accord.`
`Because of this, they were often viewed by Krauss and the others as Kinzo's underlings, and shunned.`
`And in reality, Kinzo would seldom let anyone other than them enter his study.`
`You could probably call this sudden shift change a clear expression of that sense of distrust.`
`Considering the time Kinzo had left to live, this would definitely be the last family conference before the problem of the inheritance would come up.`
`On top of that, the mysterious letter that claimed to be from {f:5:Beatrice} had dropped in out of the blue.`
`Krauss definitely wanted to keep Kinzo's loyal subjects away from the table of such a delicate and important discussion...`
`"......If you would excuse me, I will go rest.`
` ...If anything happens, call me immediately."`
`"Our company tonight is...{i:special}."`
`""Yes, certainly, Genji‐sama.""`
`Genji nodded back, went behind a screen, took off his jacket, and slowly began to relax after a day's worth of tension...`
`".........The ones who just returned now, were they the children...?"`
`"Yes.`
` The other relatives are having a conference in the mansion.`
` It looked like it would drag on until much later..."`
`"......That would be comfortable.`
` It's already this late, and there's this weather.`
` Probably, the rest of the relatives will spend the night in their rooms in the mansion."`
`"Yes, probably...`
` I'm only saying this because Genji‐sama isn't around, but...`
`...I'm a little happy I was sent to the guesthouse......I think..."`
`"Oh...?`
` Why's that?`
` Because you were able to distance yourself from the bullying of Madam and Eva‐sama?`
` ...Or do you have another reason?"`
`"I, ......I don't have any...`
`...o‐other reasons...!"`
`".........I see.`
` Then, let's do our best together with our midnight shift.`
` I'm counting on you, Nee‐san."`
`"Ah, ......umm.........`
` Just now, I was asked to go to the children's room and play with them..."`
`Shannon hung her head apologetically, ...and made uncertain glances toward Kanon's eyes.`
`Kanon didn't try to meet her gaze, and spoke curtly as he sighed.`
`It looked like he didn't plan on indulging his "sister".`
`"............You can't.`
` You were assigned the night shift.`
` ...And besides that, it is not necessary for furniture like us to respond to an invitation to play.`
` ...You understand, right?"`
`"Y‐...yes, I do understand.`
` ..................nn."`
`Shannon dropped her shoulders slightly.`
`...She had already expected that Kanon, who considered rules to be very important, would probably say something like that, but even so, she was a little discouraged.`
`As Kanon turned the pages of a logbook, he spoke without facing Shannon.`
`"............In that case, you must be keeping the children waiting.`
` You will have to apologize and tell them that you have the night shift and won't be able to stay with them.`
` ......Off you go, then."`
`"Huh.........ah, yes!`
` I'll just go apologize..."`
`Shannon hurriedly stood from her seat before her brother's mood could change, gave a quick bow, and flew out of the servant room...`
`As he watched her disappear, Kanon took a single deep breath...`
`Genji's voice came from beyond the screen.`
`"......Kanon.`
` ......I will be here, so you should go too."`
`"Genji‐sama...`
` ......Shannon was the only one called.`
` It's not like I was invited..."`
`"That is only because you were not there at the time.`
` If you had been, you would have been invited as well.`
` ......It is good to play as a child from time to time."`
`".......................................`
` ......No, that's not something that I need to do.`
` ......A human child may have a need to play.`
` ......But we......are furniture."`
`".....................Is that so."`
`".........Nee‐san is also...`
`furniture.`
` .........Even if she pretends to be a person,`
` ...it will only hurt her later.`
` ...I understand that, so I try not to get too close to people."`
`Genji did not say anything after that.`
`......A few moments passed, and then he stood up, used a pot of hot water to make some hot chocolate from powder, and served it to Kanon as well.`
`"Holy crap, seriously?!?!`
` I did not know that...!!"`
`"Keep it down, dumbass!`
` You'll wake Maria up!"`
`Battler was so surprised that he yelled obnoxiously and scattered his cards everywhere.`
`His voice caused Maria to turn over once, but she soon fell back into a deep sleep...`
`Jessica gave him a jab, and he lowered his voice.`
`"No, but, yeah...now that you've said that...they really did have that kind of atmosphere, didn't they...`
` ......Haa, now I see, that George‐aniki..."`
`George could not be seen anywhere in the room.`
`{n}A short while ago, when Shannon had come into the room, George had suddenly said that he had forgotten something in the mansion and needed to go back and get it.`
`Shannon had said she would guide him, just like she had on the way to the guesthouse, and the two of them had departed together.`
`"......They've been showing signs of it for a long time, you know?`
` Asking what the other person liked, asking what their hobbies were.`
` I always knew it was too much to just be a passing interest!"`
`"Come to think of it, I get the feeling that George‐aniki has always been overly nice to Shannon‐chan......`
` Nowww I get it..."`
`"According to the weather report, it looks like it will be at its worst tonight.`
` It also seems that it won't stop all tomorrow, but it should get a little better."`
`"...Really?`
` Then, the boat may not arrive until the day after tomorrow......`
` ...I'm concerned that it might interfere with your work on Monday..."`
`"Hahaha, I already knew that the typhoon would be coming beforehand.`
` Just in case, I made sure that I didn't have any plans for Monday, so it's alright.`
` ...I may not look like it, but I really am the type who can plan ahead in his schedule."`
`George puffed out his chest, acting proud.`
`Compared to the normally composed appearance that George always had as the oldest cousin, he now looked amusingly like a little kid.`
`Shannon chuckled at this gap.`
`"It's no surprise that someone who will soon make his company prosperous is so well prepared."`
`"...Well, making a company prosperous really is a tough job.`
` Money isn't the only thing that's important.`
` I learned that well by studying from my father.`
` Making a company prosperous is like having a castle and leading your subordinates."`
`"My father, true to his name of Hideyoshi, really loves reading about the great leaders of the {ruby:Warring States:Sengoku} period.`
` Most of his philosophical speeches on business management start with one of them.`
` ...Did you know?`
` Takeda Shingen, who was feared as the leader of the strongest cavalry corps in the Sengoku period, started out with his troops in complete disarray, and didn't have the kind of strong leadership necessary to utilize them well."`
`"Is that true?`
` That's a little unexpected."`
`"In order to unite his troops, Shingen utilized several strategies.`
` For example, when a soldier succeeded well in battle, he would immediately honor them with a medal.`
` Normally, that kind of thing was put off until after the war and they were all awarded at once."`
`"By doing that regularly on the field of battle,`
` he immediately showed his appreciation for his troops' military exploits, which motivated them in an extremely significant fashion.`
` Furthermore, whenever one of his troops was brought down by an illness, he would be the first to rush up to them and care for them, things like that."`
`"...Takeda Shingen wasn't just the man who led the strongest calvary corps in the Sengoku period.`
` He was the person who cared the most for his troops throughout the Sengoku period."`
`"......That must be why all of his troops followed him."`
`The truth was, Shannon had already heard this story several years ago.`
`{n}...But when George started to tie his father in with one of these stories, he would always be beaming, looking like he was having a great time.`
`So Shannon did not interrupt, but merely smiled, to encourage him to continue.`
`"Of course, in a capitalist world, money is power, and it is also the height of your castle wall.`
` But you can't build up a castle or succeed in war by yourself.`
` That kind of thing can only be created with the support of many subordinates, by borrowing their strength."`
`"......After understanding this, when I look at my father's back, I realize how immature I am,`
` I see how much my father has cultivated his character by working hard, and understand well how he was able to build up all that he has until today."`
`"George‐sama, you truly look up to your father...`
` I'm jealous."`
`"A‐ah, sorry...that's not exactly the way I meant to say it."`
`"I, I am sorry... I also didn't mean it that way......"`
`The two of them awkwardly looked at their feet.`
`Shannon had no parents.`
`{n}She had been brought up in a welfare institute owned by Kinzo called the Gospel House.`
`Under the guidance of the honorary director, Kinzo, the Gospel House offered excellent students a chance to live a life of service.`
`If they were accepted, they would be able to leave the institute and work as servants for the Ushiromiya family.`
`...This was considered to be the highest honor for a student.`
`Servants from the Gospel ({ruby:Fukuin:{p:0:福音}}) House all took names with the character "{ruby:in/on/non:{p:0:音}}" in them while they served.`
`So "Shannon" ({p:0:紗音}) wasn't her real name.`
`{n}The same goes for "Kanon" ({p:0:嘉音}).`
`All of the students of the Gospel House were orphans.`
`{n}Or, failing that, people who had been disowned by their parents through some special circumstances.`
`......Because of this, the students had been taught to think of each other as their only family.`
`That's why it seemed so natural to Kanon to call Shannon his sister.`
`And while only Shannon and Kanon were working today in the mansion,`
` there were other servants who worked in the shift rotation, named Manon ({p:0:眞音}) and Lenon ({p:0:恋音}), who also inherited the "{p:0:音}" character in their names.`
`...However, there were not many servants who stayed with the Ushiromiya family for long.`
`It was standard for them to quit after three years.`
`So you could probably say that Shannon, who had been working for over ten years, was a very rare exception to the rule.`
`Working as a servant for the Ushiromiya family was a heavy burden to bear, but the pay wasn't bad at all.`
`Working for a full three years would earn more than what was needed to enter mainstream society.`
`That was why, even though the students realized what a harsh task working for the Ushiromiya family was, they still hoped to be accepted.`
`But in Shannon's case, maybe the fact that she had managed to continue for more than ten years should not be viewed as her having more willpower than any of the other servants.`
`Maybe it was a lack of courage to say that she wanted to quit, that forced her to continue working for those ten years.`
`To Kinzo, who could not even trust his own blood relatives, those "excellent" servants sent from the Gospel House were the only ones he could trust.`
`Because of that, Kinzo would sometimes allow them to wear the family crest as servants under his direct control, and have them work close to him...`
`"......Err, ......um, you've already been working here about ten years, was it?`
` You must have saved up a lot of money by now, right?"`
`"I don't know, really...`
` It's not like there's anything in particular I'd like to buy...`
` And just because you have a few million yen doesn't mean you have enough to live the rest of your life with..."`
`"So you haven't been working here trying to reach a target sum?"`
`".........N‐...no, I haven't.`
` ......I have nowhere to go outside of this mansion.`
` ......I have been getting along well with Milady and the other young servants, too...`
` ......I am sometimes scolded by Madam, but, ......caring for the rose garden and cleaning the mansion is fun..."`
`"But that isn't {i:your} life,`
` ......Sayo ({p:0:紗代})‐chan."`
`".........Umm..."`
`Shannon cast her eyes downwards when she heard her real name...`
`{n}She understood what George was trying to say and closed her mouth.`
`"Even after becoming an adult and a full‐fledged member of society, I've been studying and I've learned something.`
` ......A human's life is not as monotonous or as short as we thought when we were kids."`
`That horrifying thought that everyone has in their student years.`
`......Will the rest of my life be like a monotonous, boring, sleep‐inducing after‐school class,`
` where I endlessly, lazily while away the time, until finally, it ends, without anything interesting ever happening...`
`However, these thoughts only arise while a person is still an underage student.`
`Compared to a human's life, the time they spend as a student is nothing more than a blink of the eye—just the period before they break out of their shells, and cast off their immaturity.`
`The inside of the shell might be a hot, suffocating and boring world,`
` but the world beyond that shell is vast and filled with limitless possibilities.`
`"So far, your life has been spent only within a shell called Shannon.`
` Aren't you making the mistake of thinking that your life will always continue like this?"`
`"That is...... ...`
` ....................."`
`Shannon couldn't deny those words.`
`...She hadn't been able to find any concrete issues with her way of life,`
` and since she'd never had any desire or goal to change herself in any particular way, she had continued her life idly.`
`...And if she were asked whether her life was already fulfilled,`
` ...she wouldn't necessarily have been able to nod......`
`That may have been a truth she was deliberately averting her eyes from.`
`...As long as George did not realize that truth, she would have continued pretending not to notice, as her real life slipped away, neglected, bit by bit...`
`"......George‐sama.`
` ............Is it wrong for me to...`
`......continue...living this way?"`
`"It's wrong.`
` Ah, and by the way, didn't you break one of the rules just now?"`
`George immediately gave a strict answer, and then broke out into a mischievous smile.`
`Shannon already knew what she was being chided for, ...and it seemed that it embarrassed her, as she hung her head.`
`"Didn't you promise not to use "sama" when the two of us are alone...?"`
`".........I, ......I can't obey that as a promise.`
` .........But, if it was an order, I would have to obey it...`
` Because I'm............furniture."`
`"Then it's an order."`
`"Err,`
` ...............yes.`
` ......Certainly,`
` ...George‐san."`
`As Shannon hung her head, her face red, she said George's name again, this time using "san"...`
`"Yes, that's better, Sayo‐chan."`
`A smile rose to George's face praising Shannon's, no, Sayo's small act of bravery.`
`The way they talked with each other gave off the sense that their relationship had already been ongoing for some time...`
`For a long while, as if the weather raging around them didn't even enter their consciousness,`
` the two of them talked about the many memories they'd built during their relationship that no one else knew about.`
`Every once in a while, a flash of lightning would attempt to dampen the mood, but it could not sully these moments, which seemed to flush even the roses outside a deeper shade of red...`
`"...............Oh, ...oh yes.`
` ...I have...something I wanted to show you."`
`"......Wh‐......what could it be?"`
`George, who had been speaking eloquently, suddenly started to stutter.`
`{n}From his manner, Shannon too understood something.`
`George timidly searched through his pocket for it.`
`{n}It got caught deep in his pocket somehow, and came out somewhat slowly and awkwardly, in the same manner as his speech.`
`It was a very small box.`
` A small box covered in a deep blue velvet.`
`...Its characteristic shape was enough to make anyone realize what was resting inside.`
`Shannon had been preparing her heart a little, sure of what it must be.`
`But even so, when she actually saw it, she couldn't avoid blushing once more...`
`George opened the small box, took it out...and held it out for Shannon to take.`
`"I want you to accept this."`
`"I, .........I can't accept something so valuable...!"`
`"......You can't accept it...?"`
`"Tha‐...that's not...`
` I meant...`
` .........Something like that...`
`...is too...`
`......goo‐good...for me........."`
`"Sayo.`
` This is not a request.`
` ......It's an order, okay?`
` Accept this ring.`
` ...Okay?"`
`"Ha......u...`
` I, ......I can't...`
`......disobey an order..."`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` ...Good girl."`
`Shannon, not wanting to show her bright red face, timidly accepted the ring from George's hand while still staring at the ground...`
`That ring wasn't a simple accessory.`
`......It was a noble object, which since ancient times was meant to be offered to a special woman, with a special meaning.`
`...So, while George could order her to take it, he could not order anything beyond that.`
`Anything beyond that would depend, not on an order, but on Shannon's, no, Sayo's own will.`
`"So, from here on it's no longer an order.`
` .........Sayo.`
` I want you to answer me tomorrow, without using words.`
` ...............Do you understand?"`
`"...Err, ............h‐...how........."`
`"I won't order you any more, so this isn't an order.`
` ......But a ring is something you put on your finger.`
` ......If you like it, you can just put it on any finger that you choose."`
`Shannon had only pretended not to know.`
`{n}She had already understood what he wanted her to do.`
`{n}...But she was standing at a huge crossroads of her life...`
`"......Look how late it's gotten.`
` Let's call it a night."`
`George faced away from Shannon, seeming slightly uncomfortable.`
`"It might be possible for me to order you to put it onto a finger of your left hand.`
` You, too, might be timid and dependent enough to actually obey that kind of an order.`
` ......But I want you to do this very last part of your own will, ...Sayo.`
` ...You understand, right?"`
`"............Y‐`
`.........yes."`
`"So, ...that's my order.`
` .........I want you to think about it well tonight and show me your answer tomorrow."`
`"....................."`
`Shannon nodded back.`
`......Today was the culmination of their long relationship.`
`{n}...This moment had not come as any surprise to Shannon...`
`".........We should be getting back to the guesthouse soon.`
` If we take any longer, we'll make everyone worry about us."`
`"......Ah,`
` ......err...`
` ...I'm sorry, I...!`
` Um, I just remembered something I had to do in the mansion, so,`
` ...um,`
` ......I have to go back to the mansion..."`
`"Something this late?`
` .........Really?"`
`George stared into Shannon's face as he laughed mischievously.`
`{n}He had seen through that obvious lie of Shannon's.`
`......But, imagining how she felt, it wasn't as if he couldn't understand her embarrassment and why she might ask to be alone.`
`And so George, having understood Shannon's lie and all that was behind it, allowed her to leave.`
`Shannon entered the entrance hall to the mansion with a tottering gait.`
`Her chest was filled almost to bursting point with a mixture of exaltation and uncertainty that she couldn't easily describe.`
`After stopping for a second in front of the servant room to take a deep breath and calm her heart, she opened the door.`
`Inside, Gohda, who had been ordered to take the midnight shift at the mansion tonight, was absorbed in an old worn‐out crossword puzzle magazine.`
`He looked up for an instant to see whether one of the family had come, but when he realized that it was a fellow servant, he returned to his puzzle as if nothing had happened.`
`"......Umm,`
` ...I was told by Genji‐sama to help you."`
`"Ah, really... That will be useful.`
` I was just about to go make the rounds to close up the mansion, but I was in two minds whether I should leave this place empty.`
` After all, the meeting Krauss‐sama and the others are conducting appears as though it will continue for quite some time.`
` They might order some tea at any time."`
`"That's true...`
` Then, what shall we do...? Should I remain here while—"`
`"In that case, Shannon‐san, sorry, but would you please make the rounds around the mansion?`
` I will stay here, awaiting the family's orders."`
`"Ye‐......yes..."`
`...Shannon felt a twinge of annoyance.`
`Despite the fact that she had come here to help out as a favor, she was being forced to do the job of the person actually on duty as though it were natural.`
`Furthermore, after one‐sidedly forcing that task on her, Gohda had once again gone back to his magazine and had become immersed in his crossword puzzle.`
`For the time being, as a sign of respect for her elder, Shannon bowed her head, and she left the room to make the rounds.`
`Getting a little angry had enabled her to bring the airy sensation she had been feeling until now under control a bit.`
`Besides, she couldn't show this kind of face to Genji and Kanon.`
`{n}Until her heart was able to calm down, she wanted a little time to herself, and maybe going around the mansion wasn't such a bad way to do that...`
`From the dining hall, she began to hear the tumultuous voices of the family's discussion.`
`Someone would speak at great length, and would then be opposed by someone else.`
` That rebuttal would continue in a very long, drawn‐out fashion, until opposed by yet another person.`
`That kept on repeating.`
`{n}It was as though their displeasure was seeping out through their voices.`
`She had been told to go to the guesthouse, so it would be bad if she was discovered by Krauss.`
`Thinking that, Shannon quick‐footedly slipped by the entrance to the dining hall.`
`Then, inside the mansion controlled by darkness, she began to check that the house was all closed up, following a prearranged route.`
`She walked down the hall, checking that each window was closed.`
`On Rokkenjima, there were no humans other than the family, so in actuality, closing up wasn't that terribly meaningful of a task.`
`Until Natsuhi had scolded them that this attitude was careless, closing up had not been customary in the Ushiromiya family.`
`The metal fixtures on the completely chilled windows were freezing, and every time she went to check on them, one‐by‐one, it felt like the glow in her heart seemed to cool down.`
`".....................?"`
`Just then, she thought she saw something flickering across the hall.`
`......Flickering?`
`{n}Something like that shouldn't be visible beyond the darkness of the hall...`
`Although she thought it was probably her eyes playing tricks on her, she killed her breathing for a brief moment,`
` and, grasping a curtain, she fearfully gazed into the center of the hall......`
`However, other than the occasional crack of thunder brightening the hallway, she was unable to glimpse any flicker again.`
`......It must have been her imagination after all.`
`{n}Maybe because she couldn't calm her heart, she saw something that didn't even exist.`
`Shannon resumed checking the windows...`
`{n}However, in the back of her mind, a certain unnerving possibility had been resurrected.`
`...It was that which had been passed down amongst the servants who served the Ushiromiya main family—that ghost story.`
`In which the mansion had different masters of the day and the night.`
` ...In which the master of the night, {f:5:Beatrice}, would sometimes fly around the mansion in the form of sparkling butterflies.`
`......Come to think of it, hadn't Kanon‐kun said that he had once seen it for himself......?`
`He got sulky when I didn't believe him and told him he was just seeing things...`
`.........Could it possibly...really...............?`
`{n}The roar of the thunder gave no answer...`
`Genji once again tightened his bow tie, and looked outside through a crack in the curtains.`
`Maybe the rain had died down a tiny bit since the previous night.`
`{n}...But it didn't look like the thick rain‐clouds were planning to let any trace of the morning sun get by.`
`The morning was dim, and far from refreshing.`
`".........As expected, it doesn't seem that it will stop today..."`
`"My apologies for keeping you waiting, Genji‐sama."`
`Kanon finished checking his appearance, and exited the washroom.`
`{n}In a normal schedule, it was rare for anyone to have to suffer going straight from a midnight shift to a morning shift.`
`It was a special system, for just the two days of the family conference.`
`But then, as long as the typhoon didn't leave today, the relatives' stay on this island would last until tomorrow.`
`Kanon thought that it was best to be prepared for the special schedule to be extended one more day.`
`The two of them left the guesthouse, opening their umbrellas.`
`{n}The rose garden had been devastated by the wind and rain last night.`
`Even though they had spent several days making it beautiful to welcome the guests, it had only taken one stormy night to ruin it.`
`Kanon sighed.`
`The two headed for the mansion.`
`{n}They were supposed to meet up with Gohda and prepare breakfast.`
`Gohda was such a perfectionist that he would undoubtedly have been up for some time already, and now be in the middle of preparing a breakfast both exquisite and as elegant as glasswork.`
`They reached the overhang by the entrance to the mansion, and folded up their umbrellas.`
`Genji took from his pocket a bundle of several keys, and used it to unlock the front door.`
`There was nothing on Rokkenjima outside the Ushiromiya family mansion, so there never used to be a custom of locking up.`
`However, Natsuhi had ordered that it be part of their duties to lock up the mansion from around midnight to early morning.`
`And unlocking in the early morning was to be done by the servants who had the morning shift.`
`Since Gohda would begin the preparations for breakfast as soon as he woke up, this task was to be undertaken by Genji and Kanon.`
`Silence had fallen in the mansion, giving the impression that the mansion itself was still asleep.`
`".........Well then, let us begin the morning chores."`
`"Yes."`
`The two of them split up and began opening the curtains throughout the mansion.`
`...If the curtains remained closed, the inside of the mansion would be unable to shake off its gloom, as if it hadn't yet managed to escape the previous night.`
`Kanon, following a well versed procedure, went around the mansion opening one window after another without having to retrace his steps once.`
`Even with this horrible weather, by opening the curtains, it began to feel just a little bit like morning.`
`While doing that, he passed in front of the kitchen.`
`...Even though he hadn't yet smelled anything, his empty stomach started aching in anticipation of the scent of Gohda's much bragged‐about cooking.`
`".........Good morning.`
` ..................?"`
`He tried to greet Gohda, who he had thought would be preparing the meal inside the kitchen, but Gohda was nowhere to be seen.`
`The kitchen was darkly lit, and never mind the curtains, the ventilation fan wasn't even spinning.`
`It was still cold in the room, without a hint of a flame, and of course no preparations for breakfast were taking place.`
`...Although it must not be allowed to happen, maybe Gohda had overslept.`
`Servants are humans too.`
`{n}They can sometimes fail to wake up or something, and be late as a result.`
`...In the rare case of that happening, it was the virtue of a servant to casually smooth the situation over so as not to cause an unsightly scene,`
` and to make sure that their masters never even notice that such a mistake happened in the first place.`
`Kanon took up the receiver of the phone fitted to the wall, and dialed the extension number for the room where the servants slept.`
`"........................?"`
`......He couldn't hear that characteristic sound of a dial tone.`
`Kanon tried picking up the receiver again, but even so, he couldn't hear the usual dial tone.`
`He tried dialing again, but it had no apparent effect.`
`......Could it be that the lightning last night had caused a mechanical fault and broken the internal telephone lines?`
`The equipment in this mansion was all worn out.`
`{n}Kanon fully understood that even the smallest thing could have caused it to break down.`
`Kanon gave up trying to wake him with the phone, and dashed off to the room where the servants slept.`
`...How long had she slept until? How long had it been since she had awoken and started lazily staring up at the ceiling?`
`......That vague sense of awakening was Natsuhi's usual morning experience.`
`Her sleep was always light, and she wouldn't even have been able to sleep at all without medicine.`
`{n}...To Natsuhi, sleeping was definitely not a happy thing.`
`When she looked outside, she saw that it was still pouring.`
`{n}If she hadn't sensed a tiny amount of light, she might have mistakenly thought that it was still last night.`
`...She herself was one of the hosts, so she mustn't wake up later than her guests.`
`Urging herself on, she raised up her body, which still hadn't completely recovered from yesterday's weariness.`
`While she was inside this room, no one would torment her.`
`{n}Her headache wouldn't get any worse than it already was.`
`{n}......This room was her only peaceful space.`
`So when she left, it meant returning to the world of her husbands' siblings probing each others' minds.`
`...Then wouldn't it be better to just stay locked up in this room forever...?`
`Natsuhi smiled bitterly at this fantasy.`
`{n}...She was starting to sound like Kinzo.`
`...Even though most of the time she would call Kinzo names for staying locked up in his own room and taking no notice of anyone, the truth was that she actually longed to do so herself.`
`......Natsuhi gave her head a small shake, and her fantasy was replaced by the reawakening of her usual headache.`
`When she reached for the doorknob, trying to leave the room, her hand touched the scorpion charm that she had hung from it before going to sleep the previous night.`
`......It was Maria's charm, that Jessica had given Natsuhi.`
`If she remembered correctly, Jessica had said something about it having the power to repel magic, and that she should hang it from her doorknob.`
`...Maybe it was thanks to the charm that at least this room had been protected from her husband's siblings' malice.`
`......As she thought this, her mood began to get a little more cheerful.`
`"...............So perhaps it was thanks to Jessica...that I was able to get a little peaceful sleep..."`
`Then Natsuhi remembered.`
`{n}That's right, last night, I promised Jessica that I would give her a charm of my own in exchange for this one, didn't I?`
`Natsuhi opened a drawer of her dresser, and took out an antique accessory case that she had treasured ever since she was a child.`
`Inside, there were many small objects that Natsuhi had thought were valuable at the time.`
`From amidst those, she pulled out a red pouch.`
`{n}...Inside was a small, round mirror about ten centimeters across.`
`It looked quite old, but the design on the back of the mirror was very ornate, and it felt like something with historical value.`
`At the very least, it looked much more effective when compared to the other charm, which looked like a plastic scorpion key‐holder.`
`She had heard that this mirror was a spiritual mirror to ward off evil spirits, and she had been given it specially by her grandmother when her grandfather's mementos had been distributed.`
`It has been believed since ancient times that strange powers dwell within mirrors.`
`{n}Most likely, the way they reflect light created a belief that they also deflect misfortune and malice in the same way.`
`Natsuhi returned the mirror to its pouch.`
`{n}...It would probably be a fitting object to hand over to Jessica.`
`Just as she was placing it in her pocket, the sound of someone knocking on the door suddenly echoed throughout the room.`
`".........Yes?"`
`"Good morning, Madam. It is Genji.`
` My apologies for waking you so early."`
`"......I am coming now.`
` What is it?"`
`No servant had ever come to her this early in the morning, and especially not directly.`
`...Maybe something bad had happened.`
`{n}For example, maybe some fatal oversight had been made during the preparations for breakfast, and the household would be put to shame in front of the guests, or something.`
`...Natsuhi breathed out slowly, as if getting a headstart on the troubles she was surely about to be told of...`
`When she opened the door, Genji once again said a morning greeting to her while bowing deeply.`
`{n}Natsuhi tentatively responded.`
`".........Good morning.`
` Did something happen?"`
`"My apologies.`
` .........It seems that the telephones are out of order due to last night's lightning.`
` ...The internal lines have gone dead, so please forgive my coming to see you directly."`
`"The internal lines have gone dead?`
` That will be troublesome.`
` Will it be possible to repair it?"`
`"......I am afraid that we don't know the location of the damage.`
` I would like to call an expert and have him repair it."`
`"Which means that we will be unable to repair it until the typhoon has passed?`
` ...In other words, the lines will be out of order for the remainder of our guests' stay.`
` ...Will there be issues with providing them proper service?"`
`"............We will do all we can to make sure there are none."`
`"Very well.`
` ...I will be counting on you to ensure that everything goes smoothly."`
`Natsuhi let out a small sigh of relief.`
`She had been prepared for the worst,`
` but a telephone breakdown wasn't the kind of trouble she was worried about.`
`...But then, even this would probably be enough to spark sarcasm from Eva.`
`Natsuhi gave her head a light shake.`
`"Are the preparations for breakfast proceeding well?"`
`"......About that, ...we haven't been able to find Gohda.`
` The arrangements for breakfast have yet to be carried out..."`
`"What did you say?"`
`Natsuhi was indignant.`
`...To her, this was a much bigger problem than the phones not working.`
`And despite that, this piece of information was the part that had been postponed.`
`Why did everything go well most of the time, and then come to something like this when the relatives were visiting...`
`Natsuhi placed a hand to her forehead, and shook her head sharply.`
`"Most likely he is oversleeping.`
` Anyway, it doesn't matter who does it, just hurry with preparing breakfast.`
` ...............Wha—"`
` Natsuhi had exited into the hall and turned around for a second to close the door to her room.`
`The unpleasant "thing" that she saw there silenced her completely.`
`...It was an unsettling sight, as if someone had dipped their fingers in a dark red liquid and clawed at the area around the doorknob.`
`As though someone had soaked both of their hands in blood and groped at the door and the knob—`
`like someone had wanted to stage something like that and left this mark as an awful prank.`
`"Wh‐`
`......what wicked mischief is this.........?`
` How awful...!"`
`".........I also just noticed it as I came to call you.`
` I will clean it later."`
`"...M‐...most likely,`
` a vulgar joke by one of the guests.`
` ......Disgusting, truly disgusting...!"`
`Who in the world would pull such a childish and disgusting prank!`
`Natsuhi had a pretty good idea, but of course there was no proof,`
` so even if she pushed the issue, it would just seem as though she was making a fuss about nothing.`
`On the contrary, it would definitely be better for her to say she hadn't even noticed that such a prank had been played in the first place.`
`Natsuhi gave the order to have it cleaned, and headed off to the parlor with clacking heels.`
`When Natsuhi and Genji arrived in the parlor, Eva and Hideyoshi were already there.`
`".........Good morning, everyone."`
`"Mornin', Natsuhi‐san.`
` I heard Gohda‐san would be makin' us breakfast too, isn't that right?`
` My stomach's been gettin' all excited since I woke up.`
` Wahahaha."`
`"Yes, food is about the only thing worth looking forward to here, isn't it?`
` *giggle* *giggle*."`
`".........You too, Eva‐san, I'm pleased to hear that you are well this morning."`
`Natsuhi returned Eva's gaze, which was fiercely competitive even though it was early in the morning, with a weary expression.`
`Then Kanon jogged in.`
`After bowing in apology to the relatives for running inside the mansion, he approached Genji and told him something in a small voice.`
`"......Kanon.`
` Have you still not found Gohda?"`
`".........My apologies, Madam.`
` I went all around the inside of the mansion and the guesthouse,`
` ...but, still..."`
`"Where in the world has he gone?`
` ......For now, breakfast is a higher priority than finding Gohda.`
` Quickly, take care of it."`
`".........Yes."`
`Kanon glanced at Genji.`
`{n}...It looked like he had something else to report, but needed to ask Genji whether he was the right person to say it.`
`...Genji nodded, and decided to give the report himself.`
`"............Madam.`
` It is not only Gohda.`
` ...Your husband is also nowhere to be found."`
`"My husband?"`
`"Yes.`
` I thought I would report to him before you about the lack of preparation for breakfast, and visited his room, but I did not find him there.`
` Furthermore, it was not only he who was missing.`
` ......Rudolf‐sama and his wife, as well as Rosa‐sama, are nowhere to be found."`
`"Not even in the guesthouse?`
` And not in the mansion?"`
`".........Yes.`
` Nor are they in their rooms in the guesthouse."`
`When she had heard that Gohda alone was missing, she had thought that he might have slept in or was loafing around somewhere,`
` but once she heard that several of the relatives were also missing, she began to start thinking a little more optimistically.`
`Last night's family conference might have continued all night, and in fact might still be going on.`
`It would then be imaginable that they had wanted to cool off their heads after being in that stuffy room,`
` and had all gone off on a group walk through the rain.`
`...The part about "cooling off their heads" really sounded like something Krauss would like to say.`
`Probably, Gohda had been called to go with them to aid them with something.`
`Gohda was not a man who lost track of time.`
`{n}He had to have understood that, if he did not return, the preparations for breakfast would be hindered.`
`So perhaps, as much as he'd like to leave, the atmosphere would not permit him to,`
` and the conference was continuing in that manner even this very moment.`
`......Yes, Natsuhi thought this to be an extremely persuasive theory.`
`Natsuhi remembered the illusion that she had felt that morning of being sucked into a continuation of the previous night,`
` ...and upon learning that the feeling wasn't just an illusion, she once again let out a deep, weary breath.`
`Because the banquet of the filthy vultures circling around Kinzo's property was still continuing.`
`"......Most likely, they are still repeating that same discussion about the inheritance somewhere in the garden, or maybe the beach.`
` ...In any case, we must call Gohda back, or we will never be able to complete the preparations for breakfast."`
`"So what're you sayin'?`
` ...Are Nii‐san and the rest still continuin' their discussion...?!"`
`She had thought she'd spoken in a small voice, but Hideyoshi had overheard her, and managed to grasp the situation.`
`"Nii‐san and Rudolf sure are tough.`
` And maybe it's just youth in Rosa's case?`
` ......The two of us were so tired that we had to go back to bed just after midnight.`
` I do remember that Nii‐san and the rest were still having a heated discussion at that point.`
` ......Men sure are nasty when they get excited."`
`Natsuhi snorted, her face still blank.`
`"Kanon, search outside.`
` If you find Gohda, tell him to return immediately and begin preparations for breakfast."`
`"......Certainly."`
`"Natsuhi nee‐san, they aren't necessarily outside, right?`
` Couldn't they also be inside Father's study?"`
`"...Ah, sure, I could see that.`
` I don't know what they've been discussin',`
` but there's also a decent chance that they've moved to Father's study and included him in the discussion."`
`"......I cannot imagine that Father would willingly invite that detestable topic into his study."`
`"You really think so?`
` Well, then there's nothing we can do.`
` I'm sorry, Genji‐san, Kanon‐kun, but could you search outside?`
` I'm sure it wouldn't be odd for Nii‐san to propose that they go outside for a walk to cool their heads.`
` Even in this weather."`
`"I will go to Father's study.`
` After all, there's still some chance they'll be there, isn't there?"`
`"..................Eva‐san, a guest such as you mustn't trouble herself.`
` I will go.`
` I can also tell him good morning."`
`"Really, then I'm counting on you, alright?`
` But I somehow doubt whether he will return your greeting.`
` Natsuhi nee‐san, were you on good terms with Father?"`
`".........I don't know whether it could be called good terms,`
` but I am certain that I have gained his trust as the wife of the successor to the Ushiromiya family."`
`"Then I'm sure that he will at least answer you, won't he?`
` I want to at least eat breakfast with Father.`
` I wonder if you could convince him to come down and join us?"`
`"......It seems that he thoroughly despises the rest of us, but I'm sure if his {i:trusted} Natsuhi asks, he will surely listen."`
`"...If you can't convince Father after speaking to me so sharply, and have to come down by yourself.........`
`I doubt you'll ever again be able to say that you have gained his trust, will you...?`
` *giggle*giggle*!"`
`"............I am not confident, but I will try."`
`Natsuhi responded, discouraged.`
`{n}However, knowing Kinzo's temperament, she had absolutely no confidence in her ability to bring him out.`
`...Eva herself was treating it like a joke, expecting that it couldn't be done.`
`But even so, Natsuhi would lose face if she gave up, said it was impossible for her, and let Eva go instead...`
`Eva's mean‐spirited and unreasonable demand caused Natsuhi's tightly clenched fist to shake.`
`...When Genji realized this, he softly spoke to her over her shoulder.`
`"......Madam.`
` If you would, please take this."`
`"Is that...?"`
`Genji handed Natsuhi a sparkling gold key of ornate design.`
`{n}It was the key to Kinzo's study.`
`The study would always lock itself, and couldn't be unlocked as long as Kinzo forbade entrance.`
`However, since Genji was especially trusted by Kinzo, he was allowed to carry a key to that door...`
`"But, if this key is used, won't you also receive the blame...?"`
`"......When the Master is sleeping deeply, simple knocking on the door may not reach his ears."`
`"...And when persuading the Master to leave his room, it would be more difficult if you must talk through the door.`
` Please use it..."`
`"......Genji..."`
`Until now, Natsuhi had thought of Genji as a cold servant who worked directly under Kinzo, and would never work for her.`
`But it looked like she would have to alter her understanding of him...`
`She wanted to communicate her feelings of thanks, but by then, Genji had already turned his back on her, and was walking down the corridor with Kanon.`
`...But as Natsuhi watched them go, the words that reached her from behind were sneering.`
`"Be sure you bring Father with you, then, okay?`
` After all, it's his son's darling wife who's asking. I'm sure he'll listen to you.`
` *giggle*giggle*.`
` We are guests, so let us leisurely relax here."`
`"Quit it, Eva, you're talkin' too much.`
` Sorry, but Natsuhi nee‐san, we'll leave Father to you..."`
`Natsuhi left without replying, at a swift pace, her heels clacking loudly with every step.`
`After all that excitement the previous night, there was no way anyone was going to wake up soon.`
`George‐aniki, Jessica and I were snoring loudly on the bed in the cousins' room.`
`But Maria, who didn't join in, and who had gone straight to bed the previous night, suddenly and completely opened her eyes.`
`"......................................."`
`As she rubbed her sleepy eyes and looked around, the loud snoring coming from the three cousins continued.`
`...For a while, Maria had to think about what had happened.`
`After that, she realized that her mother was not with her, and quickly got lonely.`
`Maria left the cousins' room, trying to head to the room that had been arranged for her and her mother.`
`Paying no heed to the three who were sleeping soundly, she made a loud slamming sound on the way out.`
`In response, Battler mumbled and rolled over in his sleep, but it wasn't enough to wake him up.`
`After a while, Maria returned, once again opening the door with a lively bang.`
`"..................Uu."`
`When she had left the room, her face had been sleepy, but after returning, she now looked discontent.`
`After that, she climbed up on Battler's bed, which happened to be the closest, and started yelling and jumping on it like it was a trampoline.`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Waaake uuup!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Waaa, what, what?!`
` Is it a raid?!`
` Surround themmmm!!"`
`After making sure that I was awake, Maria jumped over onto George‐aniki's bed and started bouncing on that too.`
`...In that manner, the three of us were all greeted with an extremely pleasant awakening.`
`"Thanks, Maria‐chan, for waking us up.`
` You stopped us from sleeping in after that late night..."`
`"...But it would have been perfect if you could have just been a little more gentle..."`
`"...George nii‐san, you really are an adult, I respect that..."`
`"It's almost seven...`
` Well, not really a bad time to wake up.`
` *yaaawn*."`
`"Uu!`
` Mama's not heeere!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!"`
`"Auntie Rosa?`
` She wasn't in her room?`
` I wonder if she has already woken up and gone to the mansion."`
`"She's—not—heeere!!`
` Uu‐uu!`
` Uu!`
` Mammaa!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`Maria kept groaning "uu‐uu" and looking unhappy.`
`{n}It seemed like she wasn't simply lonely because she couldn't find her mother, but actually unhappy because her mother wasn't in the place she thought she was, and this made her feel like she'd been tricked.`
`If we could have just told her where her mother was, that might have been enough to satisfy her,`
` but unfortunately, as long as we were here, we had no way of finding that out.`
`"It's time to go for breakfast anyway, so let's head over to the mansion."`
`"Good idea.`
` Maria, let's go to the mansion together, okay?`
` I'm sure Auntie Rosa will be over there too."`
`"Uu?`
` Mama's in the mansion?`
` Then I'll go.`
` Uu."`
`"That's right, let's go to the mansion.`
` Our parents have probably already gone there."`
`Maria regained her usual composure, as though her earlier temper had never happened.`
`We got dressed, left the room, and headed for the mansion.`
`The door to the study was once again knocked upon.`
` But there was no answer.`
`...He was still sleeping, and she couldn't wake him.`
` ...If she returned downstairs saying something like that, Eva would be very amused and triumphant.`
`And even aside from the whole Eva issue, there was the problem that yesterday, during this once‐a‐year family conference, he had stayed locked up all day, and had still not come out to greet the guests.`
`...Even though he was the head—no, especially because he was the head—he couldn't fail to make an appearance.`
`...Could she convince him?`
`{n}Natsuhi readied herself, and, using the key that she had borrowed from Genji, opened the door...`
`A sweet stench that seemed to eat into her brain poured from the narrow opening she had created, and though she was prepared for it, she couldn't help but grimace.`
`Thinking that he might still be sleeping, Natsuhi entered the room quietly...`
`When she did, Kinzo, already awake, was looking down out of the window.`
`"S‐......so you're awake...`
` Good morning..."`
`"..................How did you get in?"`
`Kinzo spoke with his back still facing her.`
`His voice was not harsh, but calm, and Natsuhi was slightly reassured.`
`...However, he was at least in a bad enough mood that he had ignored the sound of all of that knocking even though he had been awake.`
`Natsuhi wasn't able to break the tension.`
`"......My sincere apologies.`
` I asked Genji‐san, and he allowed me to borrow the key to the study..."`
`"Hoh...`
` Genji did?`
` .........If my friend thought it was that important, then I have no choice but to listen.`
` Tell me, ...what business do you have?"`
`"Y‐yes...`
` .........Breakfast will soon be prepared, and I would greatly appreciate it if you would join us..."`
`"I will eat here.`
` Have it brought here like always."`
`"But Father...`
` This is the annual family conference.`
` Please, at least let them see your face."`
`".........You ask me to go downstairs,`
` and join in on the discussion of how my inheritance is to be chewed apart after I die?`
` How foolish."`
`".........They can keep talking about that kind of thing as much as they like without me.`
` And if that's what you call a family conference, it's nothing so important that I should leave my room for it.`
` I am busy.`
` Do not bother me."`
`With his last words came the threat that any further questions would be useless.`
`...Natsuhi realized that adding any further pleas would finally bring his wrath down upon her.`
`It would be annoying to hear Eva sarcastically say that she hadn't been able to convince him after all, but there was nothing more Natsuhi could do...`
`".........Is that so......?`
` ...Understood......`
` I am sure that everyone will be sorry to hear it, but I will tell them."`
`Natsuhi decided to give up.`
`{n}Bowing silently, she made to leave the room before Kinzo's spasmodic temper could fire up.`
`As she did, Kinzo called out to her.`
`......Compared to the usual Kinzo, this voice was calm and gentle, like it came from another person.`
`"......Natsuhi.`
` ...It has been quite some time since you married into the Ushiromiya family."`
`"Y‐......yes.`
` ...It has been a while since I was first permitted to bear the name Ushiromiya."`
`"......Do you sometimes long for your previous family?"`
`"...............No.`
` ...Marriage means throwing away your parents' family.`
` I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi.`
` If I have a family to return to, or to reminisce over, it is only the Ushiromiya family."`
`It was definitely not an exaggeration.`
`{n}Such was the level of Natsuhi's resolve in calling herself an Ushiromiya.`
`......That was why she was so sorrowful that, despite all of her effort, it had been fruitless and she was not even accepted by her husband.`
`".........If Krauss had been a woman,`
` ...and you had been the husband...`
` ............No, ...I won't say that."`
`"Wh‐......what do you mean by that,`
` ...Father?"`
`Natsuhi was shocked.`
`{n}......If Kinzo's words just now had been meant literally...`
`.........They would have been more than enough to make up for all she had suffered up to that point.`
`"...............Forget it.`
` It's just the nonsense of an old man."`
`Kinzo once again faced away from her.`
`{n}...He had told her to forget it, but Natsuhi couldn't help feeling a warmth in her heart...`
`"...Father.`
` ............Even though I am not connected to you by blood, I am still your daughter.`
` .........The honor and glory of the Ushiromiya family,`
` ...and everything that you have left,`
` ......I guarantee you, I will see it protected myself......!"`
`"..................You do not have the qualifications to wear the One‐winged Eagle.`
` ...However, the One‐winged Eagle is surely engraved in your heart.`
` .........In that case, you are unmistakably my blood relative, and one who will inherit the glory of the Ushiromiya family."`
`"............Some will sneer that there is no eagle on your clothes.`
` However, that is nothing to lend an ear to.`
` ...Only those who hold the eagle in their hearts are my true blood relatives.`
` ............I now believe it an honor that I was able to welcome you into the Ushiromiya family..."`
`Without saying anything more, Kinzo remained with his back to Natsuhi.`
`However, Natsuhi couldn't help but feel something warm well up inside her that she hadn't felt since long ago, when she had been just a child...`
`Natsuhi bowed silently to his back and left the room...`
`"...Ah, what perfect timing.`
` How is Father?`
` You were taking so long, I came to check, you see?"`
`When Natsuhi left the study, she saw Eva climbing the stairs, and their eyes met.`
`Eva was smirking unpleasantly, thinking that Natsuhi had just left the room trudgingly after failing to convince Kinzo.`
`However, the way Natsuhi was now, such a frivolous laugh would not disturb her.`
`......She was not permitted to wear the family crest on her clothing.`
`{n}.........But she was permitted to wear it in her heart.`
`So she spoke calmly, clearly, ...and confidently, with the dignity of the one who would protect the glory of the Ushiromiya family.`
`"Father said that he would not join in on the family conference.`
` He says that he has no interest in such an obscene topic."`
`"...Yes, yes, excuses, excuses.`
` If you weren't able to persuade Father, say so frankly."`
`"......How pitiful.`
` I'm beginning to understand Father's feelings of regret."`
`"Wha‐......what do you mean by that...?"`
`Natsuhi did not answer.`
`Just as Kinzo had done earlier, she showed Eva her back as she headed down the stairs.`
`Struggling to gather what had happened, Eva could only determine that she had been made fun of, and that something had happened to quickly bolster Natsuhi's confidence.`
`Even so, she didn't have the courage to risk Kinzo's wrath.`
`Unable to even knock on the door, she could only scratch at the air in front of it, cluck her tongue, and follow after Natsuhi.`
`"S‐so, were Nii‐san and the rest there?`
` Did Father tell you about them?"`
`"......I didn't get the chance to ask, but they were not inside the study.`
` ...Father would never let them into his room to discuss such a lowly topic, so it is unlikely that he knows where they went.`
` Let us go downstairs and wait for the servants to return from their search."`
`"...Breakfast may be late, but how about some tea, Eva‐san?"`
`"......I, ...I will be fine."`
`Eva couldn't hide her confusion over the complete difference in Natsuhi's demeanor.`
`...She was acting so boldly, and while Eva hated to admit it, she even had a sense of dignity about her.`
`Unable to find fault with anything, she could only follow Natsuhi back to the parlor.`
`When the two of them returned to the parlor, not only Hideyoshi, but the four children and Nanjo as well had gathered there.`
`Genji, who had been talking with Hideyoshi, reported the current situation when he noticed that Natsuhi had returned.`
`"You still have not found my husband and the rest?"`
`"......Yes, my apologies.`
` ......Also, Kumasawa has begun the preparations for breakfast.`
` She said that she will need just a little longer."`
`The clock read a little past 8 a.m.`
`Eight o'clock was the time that breakfast was supposed to have started.`
`{n}The mere fact that the hosts had gone over that time limit was a disgrace under normal circumstances.`
`"......Kanon is now searching outside.`
` ...Furthermore, no one has seen Shannon."`
`"Even Shannon?`
` .........Honestly, how many people has my husband taken on this walk of his?"`
`How many people couldn't be found?`
`With the number of people having grown so large, it was starting to feel truly unpleasant, as though they were the only ones being left out on something interesting.`
`At the very least it looked like the children, no, Maria especially felt the same way.`
`She was indignant, her stomach grumbling, almost as though her mother and the others had left her alone to go off and eat something delicious without her.`
`Trying to fix her bad mood, the other children were flipping through the channels on the television, trying to find a program that might interest Maria.`
`Nanjo was sitting on the sofa, gazing blissfully at the children while reading a book.`
` No doubt it was a book about chess.`
`The sound of footsteps came rushing towards them with a pitter‐patter.`
`{n}There was only one set, so they realized before they saw the source that it was not Krauss and the rest, but probably Kanon.`
`"............Madam, excuse me."`
`"Judging by your appearance, you still haven't been able to find them."`
`"...My apologies.`
` I still—"`
`"That will be enough.`
` You've worked hard."`
`She didn't know where they were, but they had to be somewhere on this island.`
`{n}They hadn't put anything in their mouths since last night, so their stomachs must be growling about now.`
`They would surely saunter in any time now.`
`...Natsuhi was already dumbfounded, and she had begun to think that there was no urgent need to find them right then.`
`"I will go to the kitchen to prepare some tea for all of the guests.`
` Thanks to both of you for all of your hard work so early in the morning."`
`Natsuhi, acting as though the release in tension had caused a new surge in her headache, left the parlor.`
`...Kanon tried to call her as she left, but Natsuhi departed swiftly.`
`"............What is it?`
` Was there something else?"`
`".........Yes.`
` ...I was unable to find her husband or anyone else, but,`
` .........ummm."`
`Kanon sounded evasive.`
`{n}He still didn't know where they were, but maybe he had found something with some relation to that.`
`When Eva and Hideyoshi noticed this exchange of words, they came over.`
`{n}They had probably noticed the slightly strange way Kanon was acting.`
`"What's goin' on, Kanon‐kun?`
` Did you find Krauss nii‐san and the others?"`
`"......Actually...`
` Something looked odd about the rose garden storehouse."`
`"............Something looked odd...?`
` What do you mean by that?"`
`"......It was, um,`
` .........how should I explain it..."`
`Kanon once again hesitated.`
`{n}...He wasn't speaking anything like you'd expect from the usually fearless Kanon.`
`Eva and Hideyoshi exchanged quizzical looks at this display...`
`"What do you mean?`
` You don't mean to say they're inside the storehouse?"`
`"No, ...I am going to inspect the inside now.`
` I was just returning to get the key, but...`
` ......Umm..."`
`"I don't really get it, but it sounds like we just gotta investigate inside, right?`
` Where's the key to that storehouse?"`
`".........It is in the servant room.`
` Let us check inside the storehouse immediately."`
`Kanon dashed off to the servant room and returned with the key.`
`Genji left the parlor, saying that he would go check, but Eva and Hideyoshi also followed.`
`...What was this "something odd about the storehouse" that had caused the usually fearless Kanon to hesitate?`
`It was still pouring outside, but their curiosity over this "something" that Kanon couldn't talk about won out.`
`While the children made a big fuss watching television, Kanon and the rest dashed off to the entrance...`
`The rose garden storehouse was a place that housed various tools used to manage the garden.`
`It was definitely not a pretty building.`
`{n}Because of its appearance, it had been built hidden in a corner of the rose garden.`
`Kanon, Genji, Eva, and Hideyoshi came cutting across the rose garden holding umbrellas.`
`They entered a small path just off the rose garden, which was not used by those simply appreciating the garden, but only by those maintaining it.`
`As they dashed further along it, the front of the storehouse came into view.`
`It was a very old shed of a storehouse, and compared to the flawlessly perfect beauty of the rose garden, it was pretty seedy‐looking.`
` It was easy to understand why it had been built in a hard‐to‐see place.`
`Eva and Hideyoshi arrived at the storehouse long after Kanon and Genji.`
`"Hah...`
`hah...`
` You two sure are fast...!`
` I thought my heart was gonna explode..."`
`"I guess they did build a storehouse over here.`
` .........bu—`
`wha‐`
`......what is that...?"`
`When Eva looked at where Kanon was pointing, she was at a loss for words.`
`{n}Noticing this, Hideyoshi also followed Kanon's finger and was likewise too shocked to speak.`
`The entrance to the storehouse was a kind of shutter.`
` ......And there, .........`
`......Everyone there now understood why Kanon had been unable to find words that could describe what he saw.`
`On the shutter, which was completely filthy from being exposed to wind and rain for so long,`
` ......plastered on it...`
` ......Something that looked like a strange dark red...liquid?`
` Mucus?`
` Or maybe it was some sticky paint...`
` ...Some kind of ghastly substance...had been used to draw an indescribably eerie shape.`
`The rain had caused it to drip down in several places, like fresh blood leaking from an open wound...`
`There was no longer any point in being choosy with words.`
`......A ghastly dark red substance meant to look like blood...`
`...had been used to draw some kind of figure or mark,`
` ...intended to suggest something ominous.`
`...Two concentric circles were drawn there, and inside them was a design that looked like a cross.`
`The four ends of the cross were widely exaggerated, and it looked like some kind of crest from somewhere around Europe.`
`And in the cracks between these shapes, written closely packed together, were some unfamiliar characters,`
` or possibly symbols......`
`".........What a vulgar bit of graffiti...`
` ......Could this be...one of those?`
` One of those magic circles used in demonic rituals?!"`
`With reference to this ghastly shape, drawn with a deep‐red, dripping substance, Hideyoshi's comparison was not unreasonable.`
`"When was this drawn...?!"`
`"......Last night, I came here before it started raining, but there was nothing drawn here at that time."`
`"............We must do something before anyone else sees this.`
` If they laid eyes upon it, it would cause them great discomfort......"`
`"That's right...`
` Even though it's just a shed, I don't want to leave such an unpleasant scribble untouched for even one second."`
`"There is some paint inside the storehouse.`
` Let us paint over it temporarily as an emergency measure,`
` then repaint it again someday when the weather is good.`
` .............................."`
`Genji remembered that he had just recently seen another piece of graffiti, and that it too had been made with a strange, dark red substance of the same color as this...`
`.........That must have been...`
` .........That's right, he had seen it on the door to Natsuhi's room...`
`"Kanon‐kun.`
` Let's remove this graffiti quickly and return, alright?`
` Even though it's just a storehouse, it's really irritating to have graffiti around the home I was brought up in."`
`"......Yes.`
` I will take care of it immediately..."`
`Kanon squatted in front of the shutter and unlocked it.`
`{n}He then lifted it up with all of his strength.`
`A boisterous noise resounded, and the eerie shape drawn on the shutter began to get sucked in through the top as the shutter was raised.`
`...At least for the time being, that ominous thing disappeared from their direct gaze, and they all breathed a sigh of relief...`
`Thanks to a kids' program that they had come across, Maria was feeling much better.`
`Battler and Jessica were making fun of the kids' program at every turn, cackling.`
`George was enjoying the program along with Maria.`
`Nanjo sat on a sofa by himself, passing the time by reading quietly.`
`They heard hurried footsteps coming from the hallway.`
`They were footsteps from a single person.`
`...Did that mean that it wasn't the group of four that had just left?`
`Genji was the one who had returned.`
`It was very rare for Genji, who considered being out of breath a violation of a servant's virtues,`
` to be gasping for air.`
`He had probably come dashing back from outside the mansion.`
`{n}His shoulders were soaking wet, and he didn't have his usual smart appearance.`
`When Genji noticed Nanjo looking at him, he gave a small, silent bow and quickly approached him.`
`".........Doctor Nanjo, my apologies.`
` Please, come with me, quickly."`
`"Wh‐`
`.........what has happened?"`
`As Genji whispered something into Nanjo's ear, Nanjo's face changed color.`
`He stood from the sofa, trying not to be noticed by the children who were still engrossed by the TV,`
` and the two of them rapidly left the parlor, muffling their footsteps.`
`Just as they were leaving the parlor, they came across Natsuhi, who was pushing a serving cart loaded with a tea set.`
`Genji whispered something into Natsuhi's ear, and Natsuhi's face too changed color, shocked.`
`...Then, leaving the serving cart where it was, the three of them started dashing towards the entrance...`
`George noticed them running down the rose garden through the window.`
`"......What's this?`
` Genji‐san and Doctor Nanjo and,`
` ......and that's Aunt Natsuhi, isn't it?"`
`"What's up, Aniki?"`
`".........Maybe something has happened.`
` They looked horribly flustered."`
`Jessica and Maria also realized that something had happened from the fact that Eva, Hideyoshi and Nanjo were no longer in their seats,`
` and because the serving cart had been abandoned at the entrance to the parlor.`
`"Could there have been some kind of accident...?"`
`"...Let's go check it out.`
` It's no fun if we're the only ones left out, right?`
` Ihihi!"`
`For some reason, what Battler said sounded extremely indiscreet.`
`...But they couldn't deny that they were a little insecure and concerned after seeing the adults run off into the rain disregarding their appearance.`
`"......Let's check it out, alright?`
` I need to know what's happened..."`
`Jessica's insecure words spoke for all of them.`
`"Hey Maria, are you coming too?`
` Or will you watch TV?"`
`"Uu!`
` I want TV!`
` Uuu."`
`"Then the rest of us will go by ourselves.`
` Maria‐chan, we'll be back soon.`
` Stay here watching TV."`
`"Uu!"`
`By the time the kids went outside, they had lost sight of the adults, who had left earlier.`
`But it looked like Jessica had a pretty good idea of where they had gone from the direction they had been running.`
`Following Jessica, they ran through the rain‐soaked rose garden...`
`It felt like the wind suddenly got stronger.`
`{n}...The malicious sound of thunder began to ring out like it had the previous night.`
`It felt like something eerie had surrounded the island, and was trying to stop them from moving forward.`
`"Jessica, what's over this way?!"`
`"I'm pretty sure there's a storehouse for gardening tools or something."`
`"What in the world could there be in a place like that..."`
`Just as Jessica had said, a storehouse came into view in front of them.`
`{n}They could also see the adults there.`
`The shutter to the storehouse was open, and several of the adults looked as though they were searching for something.`
`For some reason, only Natsuhi was outside the storehouse, not even holding an umbrella; she was facing away from them, and it looked like she was hanging her head...`
`The ones who had just left—Genji, Nanjo, Natsuhi—`
`and the ones who had left before them—Kanon, Eva, and Hideyoshi—made this a large gathering of people, but there was absolutely no bustle of activity.`
`When Natsuhi realized that the children had come, a terrible expression rose to her face, and she ran at them with her arms spread wide.`
`"Don't come over here!!!`
` Go back to the mansion!!"`
`......However,`
` ...no,`
` because of that,`
` the kids saw that scene which Natsuhi was trying to keep them away from.`
`Inside the storehouse with the shutter wide open, a flickering fluorescent light shone down.`
` And over there, ......`
`"KyaaaaaAAAAAAaaaaaAAaa!!!"`
`Jessica's piercing shriek rang out.`
`...But that was just because Jessica's scream was the loudest.`
` ...The same thing spilled out of Battler and George's mouths as well...`
`Eva, just like Natsuhi, spread her arms, and with a terrible expression roared at the kids.`
`"George, take everyone and return to the mansion!!!`
` Quickly!!`
` Right now!!"`
`When Natsuhi had spread her arms, one might have thought that she was trying to prevent them from advancing any further.`
`...However, right now, that wasn't why Eva was spreading her arms.`
`...She was trying to hide that terrible scene from the kids.`
`It was her mother's heart, trying to protect the eyes and hearts of us children by attempting to block our view of that terrible scene by at least the width of one of her arms!`
`"......Is this some kind of joke? Is it...?!"`
`...I had seen this kind of cheap scene all too often.`
`{n}In manga, TV, anime, and movies, I had seen it over and over again...`
`This was just, just seeing something appear in real life that I had seen plenty of times before in some of those more sensational movies, wasn't it...?!!`
`That alone shouldn't...`
` Aaaaah,`
` but that, that suit,`
` ...it's that old bastard's, isn't it...?`
` I get it, then that's Uncle Krauss...`
` And Kyrie‐san, and Auntie Rosa, uwooOOOOOOoooooOOo!!!`
`"Dad, DAD!!!"`
`"You mustn't, Jessica!!`
` You mustn't go in!!`
` You mustn't look!!!"`
`"Dad, Dad!!`
` HyyaaaaaAAAAAAa!!!"`
`".........Rigor mortis has set in across the entire body...`
` ......Probably,`
` at least six hours have passed since death...`
` As far as I can tell by looking at the damaged area, there is a high probability that they were damaged after their deaths..."`
`"......No, I must watch what I say...!`
` I'm a general practitioner...examining corpses is outside my area of expertise...!"`
`"......So what does that mean?`
` Just killin' them wasn't enough, ...so they went on to do somethin' like this?!!`
` The devil, this here's the work of the devil!!"`
`Aunt Natsuhi caught Jessica in her arms and Auntie Eva caught George‐aniki,`
` ......so I was the only one who could approach the entrance to the storehouse.`
`............Aah,`
` ...if only there had been someone here to catch me too,`
` ......I wouldn't have needed to have this horrible, evil scene burned into my eyes...`
`......No, that's not it.`
`...I'm standing here, not because the people who would catch me aren't here...`
` {i:but because the people who would catch me are right there!!}`
`...Just as Jessica had said, it did look like a storehouse used to keep gardening tools.`
`A lawn mower and its replacement blades,`
` a grass sickle and a hammer,`
` a saw and some construction tools...`
` Piled up potted plants and bags of fertilizer.`
`And treated just the same, the corpses of several people had been laid to rest there.`
` No, had been thrown in there!`
`I could tell them by their clothes.`
`......That old bastard and Kyrie‐san.`
` ...Uncle Krauss and Auntie Rosa.`
` ......Further back, ...Gohda‐san and...`
`there's still more of them?`
` How many people died...`
` ......Fucking hell, I can't even count them on one hand, god fucking dammit!!!!!!!`
`I didn't know whether it had been one of these gardening tools, which if used for something other than their intended purpose could definitely be wielded with a naked brutality,`
` or whether some horrible tool had been brought in here specifically for this.`
`......Whatever the case,`
` .........the bodies lying about here, each of them had been given an atrocious makeover.`
`...This isn't a damn makeover...this is more like...`
`"their faces have been plowed"...!`
` Their faces were smashed, forced into an expression that a normal person couldn't make even after death.`
` ...I couldn't tell where the eyes or the nose were, but I could find the mouth...because it was gaping wide, the ridges of the teeth exposed!`
`But the front teeth were missing, and even the cheek that should have covered that was all torn up and exposed!`
` The stylish makeup that he spent way too much time fussing over for a guy...is no help at all...!!`
`"...UwooooOOOOoooooooohh!!!`
` Daaaaaaaaaaad!!`
` Sure, I always thought you were going to hell!"`
`"But you weren't this bad, right?`
` You weren't such a son of a bitch to have this done to you!!`
` And Kyrie‐san,`
` ......didn't I tell you to stop going out with this guy...`
` ...There was no reason...`
`...for you to go through this as well......"`
`"...There's no face... There's no fucking face...`
` Shit shit shit shit, hiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!"`
`"......Battler‐san, you mustn't look any more...`
` There's no way that your mother and father would want you to see them like this...!`
` For your mother and your father's sakes, ...you mustn't look any more!!"`
`"Dead people are supposed to have faces that look like they're sleeping peacefully, aren't they?!`
` There's no face, my dad and Kyrie‐san have no faces!!`
` I don't even know what kind of faces they were wearing when they died!!"`
`"What the hell am I meant to do?!`
` Are you telling me I have to see these mangled monstrous faces every time I remember Dad and the rest?!`
` Well that's perfect,`
` 'cause I didn't even want to remember that old bastard's smug face anyway, this is perfect, perfect!!`
`"`
`"But you know, why Kyrie‐san's face as well...?`
` Kyrie‐san wasn't a bastard...`
` ...I sometimes got a little sick of her, but...`
`she was a little cool, just like a big sister to me......"`
`"......She didn't deserve this...`
` She didn't deserve this......!!`
` At least Uncle Krauss is better, isn't he?!!`
` It's not his whole face, just the side!!`
` He at least has half of his fucking face left!!`
` Better that than this, better that than this!!"`
`"NooooooooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooooOOOOOooooo!!!"`
`Trying to shut out my reckless words, Jessica tried to fill her ears with the sound of her own screaming.`
`"...Stop it, Battler‐kun...!`
` Just stop it...just stop it......!"`
`"Aniki, Aniki!!`
` UoooOoooOOOooooooooo!!!"`
`Disregarding age and appearance,`
` ......I fell to my knees, clinging to Aniki's waist and sobbing.`
`It was as if I was crying on behalf of everyone there...`
`Representing the feelings of everyone there, I screamed over and over......`
`"...............Father...`
` .........The ones who d—`
` .........who are lying over there are...`
`Uncle Krauss, Uncle Rudolf, Auntie Kyrie,`
` Auntie Rosa, Gohda‐san...`
` ...............Five people...?"`
`"............No.`
` ......Six.`
` ......There's...`
`one more here..."`
`The body that Hideyoshi was looking down on now...was hidden in the shadow of a mountain of random objects,`
` in a blind spot to George, who stood by the entrance.`
`...So George couldn't tell...whose body it was......`
`...Therefore, .........George cursed himself.`
`{n}He cursed that part of himself that imagines the worst......and is always right...!`
`"...So,`
` ......the one lying at your feet is...`
`.........Sha‐`
`...Shannon, isn't it.........?"`
`".........Yes.`
` ......It's Shannon‐chan."`
`"....................."`
`George was completely silent.`
` ......He shook slightly, his lower lip trembling...`
`He wanted to run up to his beloved, screaming and crying.`
`...But, .........before rashly running up to her,`
` ......he mustered up all of his strength, and asked his father.`
`"......Is Shannon also...`
`......the same as...`
`.........Uncle Krauss and the others?"`
`"................................."`
`Hideyoshi deeply understood the meaning of those words.`
`{n}...So he couldn't give George a quick answer.`
`......No, ......he thought that, to George right now, that was the only possible sincere and loving response.`
`When George had asked whether she was the same,`
` ...he had meant to ask whether her corpse was the same as the others.`
`......Since Hideyoshi hadn't denied it,`
` .........it meant that the body was just as horrible.`
`"............Can I...`
`...look at Shannon.........?"`
`".....................No,`
` .........you can't."`
`"......Why...?`
` After all, ......I won't be able to see Shannon's face again, right...?`
` So, ......why can't I see...`
`...her last face......?"`
`"......The last time you met Shannon‐chan was yesterday?"`
`".........Yes."`
`"I see...`
` .........When you left her,`
` what kind of face was she showin' you...?"`
`".................................`
`It was a wonderful smile."`
`After receiving the ring,`
` ......she was bewildered even though her heart should have been decided,`
` bashful,`
` ...and so embarrassed to show him that face that she ran away...`
` ...That expression was revived in George's mind...`
`"............I see.`
` ......Then, I'm sure Shannon‐chan......would also have wished to leave you with that smile."`
`...Hideyoshi looked down upon Shannon's body lying at his feet.`
`{n}.........Just like the other bodies, it was in such a horrible state that it would make anyone want to cover their eyes.`
`......Half of the face had been smashed off, and no more than half of her expression remained.`
`.........If that remaining half, soaked red with blood,`
` had been wiped clean, that graceful smiling face might have peeked out.`
` .........Only half of it......`
`Without thinking, Hideyoshi slapped his hand over his eyes.`
`{n}......How cruel...`
`If only all of it had been crushed, if they were going to crush it; then he might have been able to deceive George's heart for a while by saying that it was just someone else wearing Shannon's clothes.`
`Yet, they had left half of the face...!`
`It caused the body so much humiliation, ......and also made it clear that this body was none other than Shannon!`
` How inhuman, how monstrous...`
`There at Hideyoshi's feet, trying his best to burn the image of the remaining half of Shannon's expression into his eyes, was Kanon.`
`......Kanon was not crying.`
`{n}...Tears had risen to his eyes, but they did not drip down.`
`But that didn't mean that he wasn't feeling as much sadness as everyone else.`
`......Losing Shannon, who had lived with him in the Gospel House,`
` whom he had loved as a sister,`
` must have been just the same as losing a blood relative...`
`"............George.`
` ......I'm sure Shannon‐chan...`
`would be grateful...`
` She wouldn't want you to see her like this.`
` .........I'm sure...`
`...she'd be thankin' you for stayin' strong..."`
`"......I understand.`
` .........I understand, Father, ......I understand......"`
`George leaned against the outside wall of the storehouse, ...sinking down powerlessly.`
`".........Father.`
` ......I have a request."`
`"What is it......?"`
`"......I want you to look for me.`
` ...............On Shannon's finger,`
` .........is there a ring...?"`
`"...A ring......?`
` ......Let me see..."`
`Hideyoshi crouched down.`
`{n}...As he did, Kanon silently pointed to one of Shannon's hands.`
`"............Yeah,`
` ......there is.`
` It's a diamond ring.`
` And not a chip diamond.`
` ...Must have been pretty expensive..."`
`"And,`
` ...............which hand,`
` which finger is it on?"`
`"......Hmm,`
` the ring finger of her left hand.`
` ......I see...`
` ......So Shannon‐chan...`
`was engaged..."`
`"...............George...`
` ......You...couldn't have—"`
`"Eva!!`
` Right now that doesn't matter!!`
` A man made a lifelong promise to Shannon‐chan...!`
` A man promised her happiness for life...`
` It doesn't matter who it was!"`
`"Being told that by a man...`
` ......It's a woman's dream, isn't it...?`
` ...I don't know when she received this ring.`
` I also don't know who gave it to her!`
` But,`
` .........even so, Shannon‐chan took this ring."`
`"And, ...she accepted it, and put it on her left ring finger.`
` ...I'm sure the man who gave it to her...`
`was happy too."`
`To most of the people there, Hideyoshi was simply disturbed by this extraordinary situation and was blurting out strange things.`
`.........But...`
`...to those who really knew the truth...`
`about George and Shannon's relationship,`
` ......everything he said made sense.`
`"............I see.`
` .........Thank you,`
` ............Father."`
`George stood up.`
` The traces of tears still streaked his face, but his expression had returned to its usual calm...`
`"......Let's go.`
` Battler‐kun, Jessica‐chan.`
` ......If we stay here any longer, we'll get in the way of the adults."`
`"............*sniff*`
` .........You're right..."`
`Jessica sniffled once, and, trying to say that she was alright, she showed her face to her mother, who had been holding her the whole time.`
`...When she faced George again, she once again had on her usual face.`
`......Although she still couldn't recover her smile.`
`"......Battler...`
` Don't lose heart........."`
`Battler kept on crouching in front of his parents' bodies...`
`"........................I'm sorry.`
` ...It took this much crying to calm me down...`
` You bastard, Dad, ...I bet you're laughing at me, always talking shit about you,`
` then crying like a baby just 'cause you died."`
`"......It's not my fault...`
` It's wired into our genes to cry when our parents die...!"`
`Battler's face was still bright red from the tears, but even though it was forced,`
` ...he had at least recovered enough to fake a smile.`
`"......Kanon.`
` ...You mustn't remain here any longer either.`
` Take the children and return to the mansion."`
`Natsuhi, unable to take a step into the storehouse, had been standing under the rain the whole time.`
` ...Maybe she had her own way of grieving, different from Battler's.`
`She realized that she had to take on a sense of responsibility now that her husband was dead,`
` ......so she gave Kanon those orders.`
`"...............Yes.`
` Madam."`
`Kanon rose silently, and turned to face them.`
`......His face was pure white, almost as though his own heart had died along with Shannon;`
` ......there was no life in his expression.`
`If, during the course of a normal day, he had been instructed to do a tour of the beautiful rose garden,`
` Kanon may have led the way for them.`
`......But now, there was no distinction between Kanon and the children.`
`{n}...They were now just kids of about the same age...with the wounds of having lost someone close to them.`
`After seeing the children go back, Natsuhi gave orders to Genji.`
`".........Genji.`
` ...Contact the police immediately.`
` They probably won't be able to come until the typhoon passes, but they should be able to tell us what to do next."`
`"......Understood.`
` There is an emergency radio, so I will use that to contact them."`
`When she heard that, Natsuhi remembered.`
`{n}That's right, the telephones were out today, weren't they...`
`However, since it had been assumed that there could be trouble with the phones on this isolated island, a radio had been installed.`
`......Anyway, let's contact the police and seek their instructions.`
`{n}...Everything else can wait.`
`".........Doctor Nanjo.`
` .........Is there anything further you can do here?"`
`"Unfortunately...`
` .........I cannot do anything........."`
`"............Understood.`
` ...Genji, could you at least cover their faces with something?`
` Exposing them like this is humiliating to them as well..."`
`".........Yes."`
`Genji picked up several towels hanging inside the storehouse,`
` when Eva stopped him in a shrill voice.`
`"Wait a second!`
` Stop.`
` This is the scene of the crime, isn't it?`
` Then we can't disturb it.`
` In our confusion, we've tracked muddy footprints all over the scene, and I'm sure that will have caused trouble for the police's investigation!"`
`"........................"`
`Natsuhi glared at Eva testily.`
`{n}......Objectively speaking, Eva was right.`
`Even so, she glared at Eva as though accusing her of refusing to do those tragic corpses,`
` which had been humiliated even after death, the simple kindness of covering their faces.`
`......However, Eva had spoken both calmly and correctly.`
`This horrible state was definitely not an accident.`
`{n}It was a crime.`
` ......Someone had killed them.`
` It was a murder case.`
`In that case, they should be careful not to further disturb the site...`
`They had to aid the police as much as possible, so that they might hand over a clue that could be used to find the detestable culprit.`
`"............I agree with Eva‐san.`
` ...Until the police come, we should leave everything be..."`
`"......What do you say, Madam?"`
`"...............You're right.`
` ...Understood.`
` Close it up.`
` ...And, just in case, we should put a different lock on it."`
`"......A different lock?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......When we came here, the shutter was locked.`
` ...That means that the culprit used the key to the shutter to lock it."`
`"Th‐......that makes sense.`
` Then, does that mean that the key which opens this shutter will have the killer's fingerprints?!"`
`"......I am sure it will be worthwhile to submit it to the police as evidence,`
` but Kanon‐kun handled it just as normal, and used it to open this.`
` It will probably also have his fingerprints on it."`
`"Also, that key was handed to Genji just now, and he took it with his bare hands.`
` ...It doesn't look like it will be very useful as evidence."`
`".........That was careless of me.`
` ...My apologies..."`
`"Genji‐san.`
` Are there other keys to this storehouse?"`
`"......No.`
` Only this one."`
`"Which means that the killer walked out of the servant room with that key,`
` ...and then conscientiously returned the key to where they found it, right......?"`
`Hideyoshi's theory sounded plausible, but was actually very strange if you thought about it.`
`{n}Why would they go to all the trouble of returning a key they stole?`
`{n}......No, if you think about it even more deeply, there are some even more bizarre points.`
`Usually, when a criminal hides a body, they are trying to delay the point at which it will be found and use that time to escape.`
`The actual place where the six were killed wasn't necessarily here, but they had been killed somewhere on this island,`
` and it would be normal to think that the reason they had been carried to this storehouse was to hide the bodies and delay the discovery of the crime.`
`......But that graffiti drawn on the shutter that looked like an eerie magic circle...`
`had eloquently indicated that the corpses were hidden here.`
`......It didn't specifically say that they were here, but after six people had gone missing,`
` by making such an obvious scribble and even returning the key to open it,`
` ......it seemed almost as though someone had wanted the corpses to be discovered here.`
`"......In any case, a lock that the killer has opened once before will not be sufficiently trustworthy on its own.`
` If we want to protect this place from the killer's hand, I think we should put a new lock on."`
`"I think that is a good plan...`
` I agree."`
`Genji fished around inside the storehouse, and unsealed a brand‐new padlock which had been inside a small box.`
`"What would you have me do with the key...?"`
`"......I will take it.`
` I will take responsibility and hand it over to the police."`
`Natsuhi took the key to the padlock from Genji's hand.`
`After that, they all exited and lowered the shutter.`
`......Because of that, the corpses were once again sealed behind that shutter, covered with that gruesome magic circle.`
`Genji crouched down in front of the shutter to fasten the new padlock.`
`...In addition to the main lock on the shutter, there is sometimes a place where you can attach your own lock in front of it.`
` This was one of those types.`
`In the midst of the roar of thunder and the pouring rain, the storehouse stood there, ominously...`
`{n}On its closed shutter was the magic circle, drawn in a creepy blood‐like substance, and swallowing up the bodies of six whole people.`
`......To Natsuhi, putting the new lock on may not have been entirely to preserve the scene for the police,`
` ......but rather, she might have felt like she wanted to shut that mouth for all eternity,`
` to prevent any more victims from being swallowed by that eerie demon......`
`"......Come on, let's go, everyone.`
` ...Doctor Nanjo, thank you very much for your work.`
` ...Genji, quickly, contact the police."`
`"I will contact them as soon as I return..."`
`The adults left the storehouse.`
`...The ghastly magic circle drawn on the shutter,`
` still swallowing the six bodies, loomed eerily, occasionally lit up by the lightning......`
`All that could be heard was the sound of the rain, the voices from the kids' television program that Maria was watching,`
` and the engrossed Maria's cackling voice.`
`In other words,`
` ......what greeted them as they returned dumbfounded from that horrible, bizarre scene,`
` was the voice of Maria as she rolled around laughing at the television...`
`Not knowing how to explain to Maria that her mother, Rosa, was dead, those who returned to the room couldn't manage any more than a suffocating silence.`
`At first, Maria returned their stares with a dubious look,`
` but when she realized that they weren't trying to blame her for anything, she ignored them and again immersed herself in the television program...`
`The children wordlessly sat down on the sofa...`
`{n}Their minds were probably blank from their state of shock.`
`Though they had all cried and mourned so much...now they just vaguely sat there, their faces expressionless...`
`Only Kanon had returned to his usual calm expression.`
`{n}...However, that probably didn't mean he had been able to wipe out the shock.`
`...Nothing was reflected in his eyes as he stared into the emptiness...`
`Hideyoshi, fidgeting as he remembered that horrible scene, kept muttering.`
` Unbelievable—That can't be somethin' of this world—It's the work of the devil.`
`Every once in a while, he turned these into questions and bounced them off Nanjo,`
` but Nanjo, in a calm doctorly manner, kept repeating that nothing could be understood by only glancing at the scene,`
` and that until the police arrived, he wouldn't know anything.`
`However, Nanjo only appeared calm by comparison to Hideyoshi, who could not contain his agitation and fear.`
`In fact, Nanjo had also received a huge shock, and his face was deathly pale.`
`Maybe it was because of their attitudes that Natsuhi tried to rise to the challenge and take control.`
`Natsuhi was apparently unchanged from her normal attitude.`
`{n}And she briskly gave directions.`
`"......I will head to where Father is.`
` ...Genji, quickly contact the police."`
`"Certainly..."`
`"I wonder if you would allow me to tag along, Natsuhi nee‐san?`
` ......Since Krauss nii‐san is now gone, the task of aiding Father has been left to me.`
` It would be improper of me to relax here while relying entirely on you."`
`Natsuhi was struck speechless by Eva's aggressive actions in a situation like this.`
`It seemed that she was claiming that, with Krauss dead, the one to take responsibility should not be his wife,`
` but herself, the next highly ranked in the family.`
`...Possibly, she was not happy that Natsuhi was ignoring her and handling matters herself in this extreme situation.`
`Of course, even Eva's mind had been blank from the shock until just now.`
`...She only returned to herself after Natsuhi started giving orders.`
`"........................`
` ......You may do as you please."`
`Natsuhi walked out without saying anything more.`
`{n}Eva followed behind her.`
`...Mere moments after they left, Kumasawa ran into the parlor.`
`Since she wasn't the kind of person to run around, it would be normal to sense that something had happened,`
` ...but since everyone had been stricken by that earlier shock, none of them took any notice of this trivial difference.`
`"......U‐umm,`
` ...Madam,`
` ...Madam.........!"`
`"If you're lookin' for Natsuhi nee‐san, she went to see Father.`
` She'll probably be back soon.`
` ...What happened, Kumasawa‐san?"`
`"Th‐that is, .........in the dining hall, ......blood, .........blood...!"`
`Everyone in the parlor turned to listen.`
`Everyone thought the same thing.`
` ...“I hope I misheard that.”`
`......Just like how any container has a limit to how much you can put in it,`
` ...no one felt like they could accept any more tragedies beyond what had already happened.`
`So they all thought it.`
` I hope I misheard that......`
`"Wh‐......what?`
` ......In the dining hall...?"`
`"When I went to the dining hall...`
`to set up for breakfast...`
` ......Awawa{0}wa{0}wawa...wawa..."`
`The first to start running was George.`
`{n}His harsh footsteps jogged Hideyoshi and Nanjo to their senses, and they chased after him.`
` Battler and the others followed.`
`They flew into the dining hall one after another, but they didn't find any change that would have caused Kumasawa to go pale.`
`...To those who had viewed that gruesome scene in the storehouse, it was a bit of an anticlimax.`
`However, Kumasawa, who had followed them, pointed it out.`
`{n}......There really were some traces of blood on the floor.`
`...Compared to that terrible scene, it was not very dramatic.`
`{n}...However, if you calmly thought about it, this definitely indicated the loss of a lot of blood.`
`"......There's a puddle of blood here as well.`
` ......What in the world..."`
`"......It appears that a great deal of time has passed...`
` ......It's probably safe to say that they were killed here last night..."`
`"I‐it would seem to mean that...`
` ...We'd been talkin' together in the dinin' hall until late into the night...`
` After that, someone must've broken in..."`
`"Father, when did you two let yourselves out of the meeting and go to sleep......?"`
`"...Hmm...`
` It was a little past midnight...`
` ......So,`
` ...sometime after that...`
`is probably when it happened..."`
`".........Christ...`
` .........I can't take this........."`
`"Milady, ......stay strong......"`
`"...Heheheheh...`
` ...After seeing that hell on earth in the storehouse, I think I can handle this much..."`
`"......Really? Great for you...`
` I feel like my head's gonna friggin' explode...`
` ......This is the dining hall, you know?`
` This is where every day I would eat, complain about school, complain about homework,`
` ......talk to Dad about my grades,`
` ......that's what this place is to me......"`
`"............Milady.`
` It wouldn't be good to remain here any longer.`
` ...Let's return to the parlor."`
`"I agree...`
` .........Uncle Hideyoshi!`
` I think this room will be really important to the police.`
` Don't you think it would be bad if we trampled all over it?"`
`Battler proposed this in a slightly powerful voice as, together with Kanon, he grabbed the pale and shaking Jessica's shoulders.`
`".........Everything is just as Battler‐san has said.`
` There is nothing more to be gained from remaining in this room."`
`Nanjo spoke while looking at the pale faces all around.`
`......Even though that horrible scene in the storehouse had felt like something not of this world,`
` at least it was in a place far from here, a place we had been able to cut ourselves off and run away from, which had helped everyone to keep on going.`
`......However, this dining hall was different.`
`It was in the mansion's main wing,`
` ...and as Jessica had said, it was supposed to be one of the more relaxing places within the mansion.`
` It was the same place where all of the relatives had enjoyed lunch and dinner yesterday.`
`......The shock of seeing this place smeared with blood reminded us of that horrible spectacle in the storehouse,`
` and forced us to accept that we really hadn't been able to run away from the scene of that tragedy......`
`"...Yeah.`
` I agree too...`
` The killer might have left traces in this room!"`
`"Amateurs like us shouldn't stir the place up.`
` ...Let's leave quick.`
` Come on, come on!"`
`Hideyoshi also understood the meaning of what Battler had said, and pushed everyone to hurry out of the dining hall.`
`...The way we were then, looking at that blood any longer would have been too harsh.`
`Nobody went against his words.`
` Everyone raced each other out of the dining hall.`
` ............Almost as though the last person in the room would be trapped in there, all alone...`
`Once in the hallway, we lent a shoulder to Kumasawa, who was leaning against the wall still trembling, and we all headed back to the parlor together.`
`...Then, Genji returned.`
`"......Oh, Genji‐san.`
` Were you able to contact the police?"`
`"..................I can only offer my sincerest apologies.`
` ...Whether it was a failure of the radio or something else that caused it, I cannot tell, but—"`
`"What... You can't reach the police...?!!`
` You tried the phone and the radio and both failed?!"`
`"...My apologies.`
` A boat will be arriving on Monday morning, and I believe we will be able to borrow their communications equipment."`
`"Isn't there a boat on this island?!`
` Can't we just take a little trip out to the Niijima Police Department?!"`
`"...Hideyoshi‐san, that would be impossible with this weather...`
` At the very least, we can't do anything until the typhoon passes by us."`
`"Krauss‐sama's boat is being repaired and is not on the island...`
` Therefore, I am afraid we have no option but to wait for Monday's boat......"`
`"H‐how could this happen...?!`
` Six people are dead!!`
` The phones and radio aren't working, and there's no boat!`
` So until the typhoon passes and the boat comes—until tomorrow morning—we just have to stay here on this island, unable to even contact the police?!"`
`".........Which means that...`
`...not just us,`
` ...but the criminal who killed everyone is also confined to this island..."`
`"......That certainly follows.`
` ......The culprit who killed everyone is still here on the island."`
`"S‐......so the bastard who killed Dad and the others can't get off the island, and he's still hiding somewhere...`
` ......Damn it, dammit{0}dammit{0}dammit!!!`
` I'll find you, you bastard, you think I'll hand you over to the police?!!"`
`"I'll tear you to shreds myself...!!!`
` Uuuughh!!!"`
`"...................................."`
`Maria had finally realized that something was odd in the parlor.`
`...Or, rather than noticing something odd,`
` it was probably better to say that she felt unhappy and neglected since everyone was getting so excited about something only she didn't know about.`
`".........Uu.`
` ...Jessica onee‐chan.`
` Did someone die?"`
`The way she spoke was completely calm.`
` ...Just as though she was talking about characters in a TV drama—as though it didn't affect her at all.`
`...Jessica probably didn't like that.`
`......As though trying to say "can't you tell just by looking at me, overwhelmed with grief!", she flared up against Maria.`
`"They all died, everyone, everyone!!`
` My dad, Battler's mother and father!!`
` Gohda‐san and Shannon!!`
` And even your mother, too!!"`
`"Stop it, Jessica‐chan...!!`
` You aren't the only one who's sad...!"`
`"...Maria‐san...`
` I know this will come as a shock, but please listen.`
` ......Your mother...`
`......has died."`
`"............Mama is dead?`
` ......Uu...?"`
`"......Yes, someone killed her.`
` ...I know it's sad, but stay strong—"`
`"........................How many people...`
`died?"`
`"Six people!!`
` Six!`
` ......Shit, shit, shit!`
` How could you do something so cruel!!`
` There's a limit to how cruel you can be, if you're a human...!`
` I don't know who it is, but the killer's not human!!`
` There's no way their blood is red!!"`
`"............Uu.`
` Killer's not human.`
` Just the{0}{nobreak:{m:-5:——}—}{0}chosen by the{nobreak:{m:-5:——}—}."`
`"Huh?`
` ...............Hey, Maria,`
` did you say something just now?"`
`Maria had just said something,`
` but since the words were so remotely separated from the flow and context of the conversation, for a second, I couldn't understand them.`
`As I was about to ask her to repeat it,`
` I was shocked by the sudden sound of Aunt Natsuhi's loud voice coming from the entrance to the parlor.`
`It looked like Aunt Natsuhi and Auntie Eva had returned from their trip to see Grandfather.`
`"You can't contact them with the radio?!`
` .........If we can't use it at a time like this, why do we even have an emergency radio!"`
`"...............My apologies.`
` I believe it was having annual maintenance inspections, but..."`
`"Wait, what about one of those boat signaling devices where you can flicker the light on and off?`
` Couldn't you use something like that to contact the next island?"`
`"......We do not have such equipment...`
` ...My apologies..."`
`Just then, Kumasawa came pushing a serving cart loaded with breakfast.`
`{n}......Since there was no way we would be able to eat in the dining hall, Hideyoshi had ordered her to bring it to the parlor.`
`"Why are we eating breakfast here?"`
`"......Aaaahhh, Natsuhi‐san... I'll tell you later.`
` More importantly, Eva, how was Father?"`
`"Judging by the fact that he is not with you,`
` .........he won't even leave his room for a situation like this..."`
`"He isn't there.`
` ......The room was empty."`
`"What the...`
` Where could he have gone at a time like this...?!"`
`"............Did you say that the Master has left his study...?"`
`"...That's right. I am as surprised as you...`
` I wonder when he left his room......`
` Do either of you have an idea?"`
`Natsuhi looked at Genji and Kanon as she said this.`
`...She probably thought that the servants permitted the One‐winged Eagle, who served directly under him, would know of a place he might go.`
`.........However, it seemed to be the other way around.`
`{n}...Their faces made it clear that those who knew Kinzo best realized even more than everyone else how impossible it was for him to leave his room.`
`".........Even we have no idea."`
`"...As you all know, the Master had everything set up within that study, from a place to sleep to a bathroom.`
` I cannot imagine him leaving that room except under very exceptional circumstances."`
`"............In that case, ...what?`
` Isn't it natural to think that one of those "very exceptional circumstances" came up...?!"`
`"We still don't know whether that is the case!"`
`"Anyway, he is a fickle person, so it's possible that he went for a walk by himself without knowing the current situation.`
` ......If that is the case, we have to tell him what has happened and ask for instructions as fast as we can."`
`"......That's right.`
` .........Although I don't want to think about it, ...it's possible that something has happened to him, isn't it...?"`
`"I don't even want to think about something that ominous...!"`
`No one had seen Kinzo since the six horrible corpses had been found.`
`{n}On top of that, the phones were broken, the radio wouldn't reach anyone, and there was no way to contact the police.`
`...It looked like the typhoon would leave tomorrow and a boat would come,`
` ......but until then, no one could rely on anyone outside the island, nor could they escape the island.`
`Everyone had lost their composure at the extremely sudden tragedy.`
`...A heavy silence and a sense of impatience.`
`{n}...Even though they needed to do something, they couldn't think of anything;`
` some of them became irritated, while others merely held their heads in their hands.`
`.........But not one of them...could explain what was occurring on this island of Rokkenjima......`
`After that, we sat in the parlor and wordlessly chewed through the breakfast that Kumasawa‐san had made.`
`Of course, this was right after something like that had happened.`
`{n}No one had any appetite.`
`...However, we realized that not eating would weaken our bodies.`
` ...It would also be rude to Kumasawa‐san, who had made the breakfast.`
`Kumasawa‐san had taken the tasteful western vegetables, ones that Gohda‐san had probably special ordered for the purpose of some extravagantly fancy dish, and cooked them in a Japanese style,`
` making them turn an unpleasant color.`
`As to what Gohda‐san had been planning to cook with those ingredients...`
`right then I couldn't even imagine it.`
`If I did think about it, I would be reminded of the way Gohda‐san had died, and the inside of my mouth would be filled with a sour taste...`
`For the time being, everyone pretended to eat, but there was no hope of anyone making any headway into the meal.`
`Then, everyone was brought up to speed on the current situation.`
`First off, ......that Uncle Krauss,`
` my dad,`
` Kyrie‐san,`
` Auntie Rosa,`
` Gohda‐san and Shannon‐chan...`
`had been found in the rose garden storehouse as cruelly mutilated corpses.`
`And that despite that, we were unable to use phones or radio, and still couldn't contact the police.`
`......So until the typhoon passed, there was nothing we could do.`
`Furthermore, Grandfather, who we had hoped might be able to show a little leadership in this kind of a situation, had disappeared at some point.`
`......Gohda‐san hadn't made breakfast, so Grandfather's stomach must have been empty,`
` and if he had just been taking a casual walk, by now he should have been stomping back to whine about how hungry he was.`
`And yet,`
` he hadn't appeared.`
`......There was more than a small chance that he had become caught up in the earlier crime.`
`Aunt Natsuhi and Auntie Eva had said that, on their return trip from going to see Kinzo, they had called out to him on every floor, looking for him, but were not able to find him.`
`...If you think about the timing of it all, it was probably best to think that he had been caught up in the crime.`
`If the culprit had taken the trouble to move the bodies of Dad and the rest, who we figured had been killed in the dining hall, all the way to the storehouse,`
` then maybe they had already killed Grandfather,`
` moved his body to some strange location, and we had simply not found it yet...`
` No one actually said it, but this theory seemed extremely convincing...`
`"We will go check that all of the windows and doors are closed.`
` We must also carefully search for Father.`
` Children, make sure you do not leave this room."`
`"Eva‐san and Hideyoshi‐san, I'm sorry, but please stay here with the children.`
` Doctor Nanjo as well."`
`"...I understand.`
` I will wait here......"`
`Aunt Natsuhi led the servants—Genji‐san, Kumasawa‐san, and Kanon‐kun—out of the parlor.`
`All that was left was Auntie Eva, Uncle Hideyoshi,`
` Doctor Nanjo, and the four of us children for a total of seven people.`
`"Let's all stick together, and maybe watch some TV while we wait.`
` Geez, Sunday daytime TV sure doesn't have many good shows on, huh?"`
`Uncle Hideyoshi tried to stir up this gloomy atmosphere, acting cheerfully.`
`"Uu.`
` Good show, watch it, watch it.`
` Uu‐uu!"`
`"Oh, really?`
` You want to watch TV, Maria‐chan?`
` Then come and watch it with your uncle."`
`Maria was the only one who played along.`
`...Even though Maria had been told of her mother's death, she didn't show the slightest flicker in her emotions.`
`Was nine really this young an age......?`
`No one else was feeling the slightest bit like joining in, and they each sank into their sofas and let their minds go blank...`
`"............Aniki.`
` Can I ask you something?"`
`"...What is it?"`
`"......Just now in the storehouse.`
` You said something about Shannon‐chan and a ring.`
` ......Did you give that to her?"`
`George‐aniki didn't answer, but he hung his head and closed both of his eyes.`
` ......There could be no clearer response.`
`"Quit it, Battler.`
` ......Have some tact."`
`"......You're right.`
` I shouldn't have asked that."`
`"...............That's right.`
` It was me.`
` .........Last night,`
` I proposed to her.`
` ...That was when I gave her the ring.`
` ......I told her that tomorrow,`
` she should put it on whatever finger she wanted,`
` as her answer.`
` ......Haha, I must have sounded so full of myself."`
`......And that ring had been...`
`...on the ring finger of Shannon‐chan's left hand.`
`".....................Actually,`
` ...I've been having talks with Shannon for several years.`
` ...About you, George nii‐san."`
`"......I wonder what she could have said."`
`"...............Shannon was always really bad at lying.`
` It was instantly obvious that it was you she was talking about."`
`"...............She...`
`asked whether it would be okay if she got close to you, being just a servant.`
` ......She asked about stuff like what kind of things do boys like,`
` and what kind of clothes should she wear to make them happy,`
` lots of stuff like that.`
` ..................How should I say it... Well, I was jealous of her."`
`".........All that...and right after she's handed the engagement ring...`
`it's just...`
`...all over?"`
`"......I know people value things differently.`
` ......But being proposed to by a man,`
` .........is, in a way,`
` the high point of a girl's life.`
` ......So I'm sure.`
` Last night, I think Shannon was...`
`happy from the bottom of her heart...`
`...no, the happiest she'd ever been since she was born..."`
`".........................................."`
`...George‐aniki, without raising his head, sighed deeply...`
`{n}......Or maybe tears had risen to his eyes.`
`"............It seems that Shannon was on duty in the guesthouse last night.`
` ......But, ...because she was too embarrassed to go back to the guesthouse with me,`
` ......she went over to the mansion."`
`"......Think about Shannon's feelings.`
` ...When you receive an engagement ring, no matter how much you've prepared for it beforehand, it's normal to feel so elated your mind goes blank.`
` ......She must have been so embarrassed she didn't know what to do with herself."`
`"......And then, Shannon,`
` ............even though she hadn't been on duty there, she went to the mansion,`
` ...............and got caught up in all this........."`
`"If only I hadn't,`
` ...on that day,`
` in that place,`
` ......given her that ring......`
`Shannon wouldn't have,`
` ......Sayo wouldn't have...`
`...been caught up in this incident...!`
` ...uuuuughh!!"`
`"Aniki.`
` It's not like that.`
` It's definitely not like that.`
` ......So don't cry any more."`
`"..................uuuuughh..."`
`"Battler‐kun.`
` Leave him be."`
`After those words from Auntie Eva, I stopped talking to him.`
`...Misplaced words of comfort might actually hurt him.`
`{n}Jessica sat down next to Aniki, and quietly put an arm around him.`
`.........Maybe only Jessica, who had known about Aniki and Shannon's love since the beginning,`
` and who had been discussing that relationship with Shannon, ...could comfort Aniki now.`
`I went over to Auntie Eva and sat down on the opposite sofa...`
`"Battler‐kun, you really are strong...`
` It looks like you've kept a good hold on yourself."`
`"...Umm, well, look, the depth of the love becomes the depth of the wound, right?`
` That old bastard, I couldn't care less about no matter how he snuffed it.`
` ...I feel bad about Kyrie‐san, but...well, she wasn't actually my parent."`
`"My, my.`
` But on the other hand, you were crying a lot back then, right?"`
`"Well, I did think that at least that much crying was due as gratitude to the parent who raised me...`
` Hehehe..."`
`".........The way you can switch your mood quickly like that, and your dry tone, must have come from Rudolf.`
` ...That kid would always get violently happy, sad, and angry,`
` but he would always regain his cool immediately afterwards."`
`"......It's nothing like that.`
` I haven't really been able to get over the shock yet either.`
` ...I think it's just that the emotions that rose up in me were...different from everybody else's."`
`"What do you mean?"`
`I was acting much calmer than George‐aniki and Jessica were.`
`...That wasn't because my sadness was less intense and I'd already sprung back to normal.`
`{n}It was because my sadness had been gradually replaced, by a different emotion.`
`"............Rather than sadness,`
` .........it's more like I'm irritated.`
` What bastard did this and where the hell is he?`
` ...I feel like I can't settle down until I've smacked him upside the face."`
`That was what I really wanted to do.`
` It was like I couldn't allow myself to just sit here, overwhelmed with sadness and hugging my knees.`
`"......Since the time Dad and everyone else was killed, this island has remained covered by the typhoon.`
` ......In short, that means that the asshole who pulled this disgusting, detestable bullshit is still somewhere on this island."`
`"It certainly does.`
` .........I wonder if they're hiding themselves somewhere in that dark forest even now?"`
`.........I felt like I'd had...`
`a very similar conversation with Kyrie‐san the night before.`
`That's right.`
` After the letter from the person who claimed to be {f:5:Beatrice} appeared at the dinner table last night,`
` ......we had talked about whether or not a 19th person actually exists.`
`"Auntie Eva.`
` .........These murders,`
` ...do you think they have anything to do with the letter from {f:5:Beatrice} last night?"`
`"...Aah, that thing?`
` ............Well, I wonder.`
` Although all of us siblings were in agreement that the mysterious letter had been sent to further complicate the problem of Father's inheritance,`
` .........as to whether that and the incident this morning are related, it's impossible to tell at this stage..."`
`"Was that letter really given to Maria by some witch called {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"How could it be?`
` All of it was a farce devised by Father, wasn't it?`
` He made someone like Shannon‐chan wear the dress from the portrait and deceive Maria‐chan, right?`
` Isn't that just like the kind of intricate prank Father would pull?"`
`".........Last night, I talked with Kyrie‐san about whether {f:5:Beatrice} actually exists,`
` and she also said that {f:5:Beatrice} was probably one of the 18 of us."`
`"Isn't that obvious?`
` There's no one else on this island besides us!`
` So obviously it must have been someone amongst us pretending to be {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"There's no one else but us on this island,`
` huh..."`
`"Obviously, right?`
` Who else could be here?`
` No one is on this island except us.`
` There are only 18 people.`
` ...So the one who pretended to be {f:5:Beatrice} has to be one of those 18."`
`Kyrie‐san had denied that there was a 19th person by "flipping over the chessboard".`
`Even though Auntie Eva hadn't constructed an argument that complicated, her opinion at least was the same.`
`...Except, if that is the case, our situation starts to look very ugly......`
`At the time of {f:5:Beatrice}'s letter, we were able to dismiss the matter as just someone's prank.`
`...However, if we deny the existence of a 19th person at this point, matters are not so jovial.`
`.........In other words,`
`"...If there is no 19th person,`
` ......then the culprit who killed Dad and the others is also one of the 18, right?`
` .........So, in other words, that would mean that someone in this very mansion is the one who killed them...!"`
`"......................................."`
`Auntie Eva smiled meaningfully.`
`...It looked like Auntie thought that this conclusion should have been obvious from the very beginning.`
`"The culprit carried the bodies of those six into the storehouse.`
` But they sure did a good job getting into that storehouse, didn't they?`
` That shutter was always kept closed and locked, I'm told."`
`"In other words, in order to carry them into the storehouse, the culprit would need to unlock the shutter.`
` ...Understand?"`
`"......Is there any possibility that the shutter was left open by mistake that day?"`
`"The servants said that it's always shut.`
` In other words, unless they brought the keys out of the servant room, they definitely couldn't have opened the storehouse."`
`"Is the only key the one in the servant room...?"`
`"Genji‐san said so, yes.`
` Which means that the culprit knew where that single key was stored and took it out."`
`"Just now, I saw Kanon‐kun return the key to the servant room.`
` The wall was packed with keys, and I don't think that a novice would know where and to what those keys went to.`
` The culprit was magnificently able to select the key to the storehouse from all of those."`
`"Furthermore, even though the key didn't have a tag or anything sticking to it, they knew it was the key to the storehouse behind the rose garden.`
` ...And while I'm at it, they also knew where the storehouse was.`
` .........I'll say it even clearer.`
` The culprit knew the inside of the servant room well."`
`Her argument was extremely plain and clear.`
`......If the bodies had been thrown somewhere in the bushes of the rose garden, no explanation would have been necessary.`
`However, the one key to the storehouse was in the servant room,`
` and stored with a large group of other keys, such that a novice would not be able to tell them apart.`
`This meant that the culprit was someone who was used to going in and out of the servant room, and knew well where the key was.`
`...The family didn't normally go into the servant room.`
`{n}......Which meant that............`
`"......Which means that...`
`...one of the servants...`
`...is the culprit......"`
`"I'm sorry, but even your auntie can't say any more than that.`
` ......However, I'll tell you one thing."`
`"......What's that?"`
`"The culprit, ......we should properly say they were culprits in the plural, and what's more, they were well‐armed.`
` You see it, don't you?"`
`"They had to assault the four in the dining hall and kill them all at once, drag a total of six bodies all the way to the storehouse beyond the rose garden, and scribble that disgusting makeup on their faces.`
` ......There's no way that a single culprit could carry all of this out on their own, right?"`
`It was impossible.`
` It might not have been if a single person spent enough time on it, but that would have taken ages.`
`It was probably best to think that a significant number of people had been part of it.`
`"...............Whoo.`
` So what you mean is...`
`...maybe all of the servants were in cahoots."`
`"Please keep it quiet, okay?`
` It's bad to speak from speculation alone."`
`"......Besides, what would you do if it really was true?`
` They might not let us return alive.`
` This is an opponent who had no trouble killing Nii‐san and the three others."`
`"The only people in this room right now who look like they could put up a decent fight are the three people in my family, and maybe you as well—four at most?`
` The situation is no different than it was last night.`
` ......In short, it would be easy for the culprit to massacre the rest of us."`
`I had been playing detective with Auntie Eva out of a desire to expose the person who had killed Dad and the rest before the police did.`
`...If I could manage to skillfully penetrate the culprit's identity, I wanted to stick the evidence in their face.`
`......I had gotten it into my head that if I did that, the culprit would give up and surrender, just like in one of those detective movies.`
`However, the culprit only surrenders there because they are in a situation where resisting would be futile.`
`The culprits behind these incidents on the island were far from helpless,`
` and might even be able to massacre all of the remaining people on the island.`
`...And on top of that, this island was like a giant locked room, cut off from the outside world by the typhoon,`
` so they had the full day until tomorrow to kill, scheme, and cover up their handiwork......`
`In short, we weren't in the kind of safe atmosphere where we could entertain ourselves by playing detective...`
`On the contrary, we were at a stage where we had to be scared stiff,`
` since playing detective might displease the culprits, and cause them to repeat another mass murder......`
`"...Well, it is just a possibility, right?`
` ......But I can't bring myself to trust the servants yet.`
` And that doesn't mean they're the only ones I suspect.`
` I also think there might be some mastermind behind all this."`
`"A mastermind?`
` Hmm... Why do you say that?"`
`"It's just a feeling.`
` ......Think about what the word servant literally means.`
` It means they serve someone—they do someone's bidding, right?"`
`"Everyone who was killed had some relation to the Ushiromiya family.`
` So it would be natural for someone with interest in that result to be involved."`
`This was also plain and clear...`
`The Ushiromiya family were currently right in the middle of discussing how to distribute the inheritance if Grandfather died.`
`If this followed the formulaic plot used to death by many classic mystery novels,`
` it would definitely be a crime by someone with ties to the Ushiromiya family and who was entangled in the inheritance problem...`
`Auntie had probably also read a few books in that genre.`
`......Her theory did have a few one‐sided conclusions to it, but it was a run‐of‐the‐mill idea that anyone would surely hit upon.`
`I think anyone would have suspected the servants, even if their logic was different.`
`Especially the talk revolving around the key to the shutter—that was enough to make it easy to suspect strongly that one of the servants was involved in the case...`
`"...............Which is whyyy...`
`I don't like it for some reason."`
`"What do you mean, you don't like it?"`
`"Nah, just talking to myself.`
` Ihihi!"`
`I dodged the question by joking, but I couldn't wipe out the sense of unease I felt inside me.`
`......Because the reasoning we had arrived at was altogether too simple.`
`{n}{i:Reasoning that anyone could arrive at.}`
` ...And I just couldn't accept that.`
`...If I tried "flipping over the chessboard" like I had learned from Kyrie‐san,`
` ......that was exactly why it was impossible for the servants to be the culprits.`
`If the servants really had been the culprits, they wouldn't have hidden the bodies in a place that was tied to themselves.`
`Certainly not the rose garden storehouse of all places, whose key they themselves controlled.`
`The police would probably immediately pursue whoever had been in control of the key.`
`That would create a danger for exposure.`
`{n}......If we were to assume that they were the culprits, they had no reason to carry the bodies into the storehouse.`
`...Did they expect us to think that, and so put them in the storehouse deliberately?`
`{n}No, that definitely didn't make sense.`
`When the police come and inspect the site, all kinds of things will probably become clear.`
`No matter how deeply careful the culprits were in carrying out murder, some kind of traces will definitely be found.`
`So, in summary, they have everything to lose and nothing to gain.`
`If you think about it this way, and look at the game from the culprit's side,`
` it feels like there's no point in advertising the location of the corpses.`
`If the bodies were found, a report would be sent to the police,`
` the remaining people would become more cautious,`
` they could start looking for who was responsible,`
` ...anyway, none of these things would make the culprits feel any more comfortable.`
`...Just like the words of the main character's mother in a novel I read recently called {i:Higurashi no Naku Koro ni}.`
`A mystery story has four parts—introduction, development, turn, and conclusion—and so, to commit the perfect crime, it is essential to eliminate the "introduction".`
`......Right now, no one knew where Grandfather was.`
`We didn't know whether he had already become a victim, or if he was one of the culprits,`
` .........but this state of confusion had to be beneficial to whoever did this.`
`By blatantly advertising the bodies to us,`
` and declaring "Hey! There's a murder case going on!", the culprit had absolutely nothing to gain.`
`Right, that was where we could "flip over the chessboard".`
`So this blatant advertisement of the bodies was itself the culprit's goal.`
`......So, it may well be that, to the culprit, {i:having the six corpses be present there meant more than the deaths themselves}.`
`In other words, the culprit wanted to display these murders.`
` To who?`
`......To us.`
` It was a message.`
`{n}The culprit was trying to shove something in our faces.`
`...I didn't know what that could be.`
`At the current time, none of us could grasp anything from this vulgar mass murder except malice.`
`......Malice towards...`
`everyone...`
`perhaps.`
`Each one of the survivors had some kind of connection to one of the six who had been killed.`
`Uncle Krauss's death brought sorrow to Jessica's family.`
`The deaths of Dad and Kyrie‐san brought sorrow to me,`
` while Auntie Rosa's death brought sorrow to Maria.`
`......Gohda‐san's death probably dealt a shock to his fellow servants,`
` and Shannon‐chan's death brought grief to George‐aniki, who had proposed to her, and to Kanon‐kun, who had loved her like an older sister.`
`......Everyone now on this island had received an equal amount of sadness.`
`Auntie Eva had claimed that the servants were definitely in cahoots,`
` ......but then how could you explain the deaths of Gohda‐san and Shannon‐chan?`
`......And by this argument,`
` {i:the grief caused by the six deaths hit everyone but Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi}.`
`It was very possible to doubt Auntie Eva herself,`
` who was acting like she was outside the net of suspicion, and who might have been trying to point that suspicion at the servants.`
`......In the first place, she had managed to avoid suspicion and place it on the servants with that argument about the key to the shutter,`
` ......but if you looked at it from a perspective of motive, about who would gain something from the murders,`
` ............Auntie Eva's name floated to the top of the list.`
`"......Battler‐kun, Auntie knows what you're thinking, okay?"`
`"Huh?`
` Ihihi, oh no,`
` please don't tell anyone,`
` that I had my head all full of {i:y'know, that kind of stuff}..."`
`"I'm the one who would gain the most from these murders.`
` ......Since I'm going to be suspected anyway, I might as well get it out in the open myself."`
`I had tried to dodge this conversation by joking around, but it looked like it hadn't worked.`
`"The inheritance is to be divided between the siblings.`
` But now, the four siblings are just me.`
` All the assets of the Ushiromiya family will become mine.`
` ......Heheheheh."`
`"If Uncle Hideyoshi heard you, he'd say "Give it a rest Eva, it's not a joke"..."`
`"I'm sorry, okay?`
` No matter how I try to smooth it over, I'll just be suspected anyway, so I was just fooling around."`
`"......So I've been thinking, from my point of view, this murder might have been planned to cast suspicion on me.`
` ......Unfortunately, my alibi for last night is weak."`
`"Could you tell me about it?`
` About last night?"`
`"As you know, the discussion of how we siblings would gnaw apart the inheritance continued until late in the night.`
` But I don't know how late it lasted.`
` My husband and I had woken up early that morning.`
` We were so sleepy, and we let ourselves out a little past midnight.`
` We then returned to the guesthouse and rested there."`
`"......Can anyone other than Uncle Hideyoshi prove that?`
` Oh, of course, it's not like I'm suspecting you or anything, you kno~w?`
` Hihihi!"`
`"My, I wonder about that!`
` *giggle*.`
` I don't know if it counts as proof, but when we returned to the guesthouse, we were greeted by Genji‐san and asked if we needed a towel."`
`"I think that should be enough to prove that we returned to the guesthouse a little after midnight.`
` ......Of course, if my theory was correct and the servants were all in cahoots, that wouldn't actually make for an alibi, would it?"`
`"That is a point, isn't it?`
` Does that mean that, right now, I'm playing detective with the real culprit?`
` Ihihi!"`
`"But let me say this for my honor's sake: if my goal was the inheritance, I wouldn't commit this weird kind of murder!"`
`"After all, if I just wanted to make them forfeit their rights to the inheritance, the method of their deaths wouldn't have mattered.`
` On the contrary, I'd try to make their deaths look like an accident, wouldn't I?`
` If I'd been roping in the servants, and carefully planning everything out, that's even more reason I'd do that."`
`"You're right about that...`
` If you were killing someone to make a profit, you definitely shouldn't make it look like a murder."`
`"You see?`
` So from here on, your auntie will be in a very blue mood.`
` ......I'll probably be treated as the person behind this by the police, and harshly investigated.`
` I can't wait..."`
`Auntie Eva shrugged with a bitter smile.`
`......Just like it was easy to think of the servants as suspicious, it was also very easy to think of Auntie Eva as suspicious.`
`So if we "flip over the chessboard",`
` ......did that mean it was impossible for the culprit to be the easily doubtable Auntie Eva...?`
`However, if that logic could pass so easily, then motive wouldn't count for anything.`
`No, that can't be right...`
`{n}Knowing the motive should be a big clue towards knowing the culprit.`
`...That is why murderers throughout history have tried to ensure their motive will not be found out, by skillfully complicating the incidents......`
`.........I don't know, ...I don't know...`
`{n}Every time I flip over the chessboard, it keeps flipping from front to back and back to front...`
`...Were my thoughts closing in on the truth?`
`{n}......Or.........`
`Auntie Eva didn't want to talk any more than that, so I headed to the window, folding my arms, so that I could cool my head a little.`
`As I looked over the parlor, I saw George‐aniki and the others gathered, talking.`
`...It looked like they were talking about the magic circle that had been painted onto the shutter.`
`As Uncle Hideyoshi thought back to that time, he started drawing the shape in the margins of Maria's notebook.`
`......Yes, Maria is second only to Grandfather in knowledge of the occult, so she might understand what it meant.`
`"Hmmm, I think it was probably somethin' like that!`
` There was a mark like a cross, but tweaked a bit."`
`"And then, there were these closely packed strange letters all inside the outer circle like this, and there was somethin' written on all four sides of the cross, and in the empty spaces in the corners as well.`
` It didn't look like the alphabet or somethin' like that.`
` It was what they call ancient characters."`
`"......Also, around the top of the circumference, there was a small mark.`
` ...Five small circles arranged in a plus sign, and straight lines connecting them..."`
`"Ah, yes, there definitely was somethin' like that drawn there...!`
` Yep, this was it, there's no mistakin' the shape.`
` I don't know the exact characters, but the arrangement was nearly the same."`
`Everyone was staring down at the shape, so I stared down at it too.`
`...From what I had heard, this had been painted on the shutter to the storehouse with some material that looked like blood.`
`......I see, this sure is unsettling.`
`"...Grandfather's about the only one who'd get it into his head to draw this nonsense.`
` ......Seriously, where did he go?!`
` I wanna grab him and ask what the hell this is supposed to mean!!"`
`Jessica's voice contained impatience and anger.`
`She hadn't gone so far as to say that Grandfather was the culprit,`
` but it looked as though she thought that Grandfather definitely knew the culprit's identity.`
`......Certainly, if you asked around for the link that bound the Ushiromiya family and the occult together, ten out of ten people would name Grandfather.`
`......And, to a person who knew nothing of the occult, this strange mark would have no meaning.`
`Which meant that......`
`...this might have been...something addressed to Grandfather......`
`That's right, the reason to advertise the crime is to show it off to the survivors.`
`......In that case, where had Grandfather, as the essential recipient of this message, disappeared off to......?`
`"Does this shape ring any bells...?"`
`"..............................`
` ......Uu."`
`Maria looked at the shape with a serious face.`
`...Maybe she was enthusiastic since this was her area of expertise.`
`...However, her appearance was that of someone separated from the events at hand,`
` ...as though this thing hadn't been drawn on the shutter closed around her mother's corpse...`
`"......My first impression was that the design resembled some kind of foreign cross‐like symbol..."`
`"Aah...`
` It certainly does have that kind of design.`
` Does that mean it has somethin' to do with that foreign country?"`
`"That cross symbol was originally a crest from a religious order of knights and was supposed to protect pilgrims traveling to sacred places..."`
`"......Then this magic circle has some religious meaning or something...?`
` This is starting to sound like gibberish......"`
`When I looked over at all of them, preparing to jump into the discussion, ......something shocked me.`
`Maria was...grinning, an eerie expression on her face that defied description.`
`...A sort of grin almost like she was making fun of everyone's ignorance.`
` ......It was an expression that I wouldn't ever have believed Maria to be capable of making...`
`And then,`
` ......she laughed.`
`An eerie, jarring laugh;`
` ...even though I was looking at it right in front of my eyes, I really didn't want to accept it as real.`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` That's completely wrong, everyone.`
` Kihhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi...`
` Can't you tell just by looking?`
` Kihhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi."`
`While everyone was scared out of their wits, Maria, alone, kept on cackling happily...`
`After a while, that laugh suddenly and abruptly cut off.`
`But her expression was still like someone completely different from Maria.`
`"This is the seventh magic circle of the sun.`
` ......The characters are Hebrew.`
` Lend it here?"`
`"Ah, ......yes."`
`Maria stole the writing materials from the stunned Hideyoshi's hand.`
`She then started drawing another magic circle, effortlessly, right next to the one that Hideyoshi had drawn...`
`"......See?`
` It was this kind of shape, right?"`
`"Y......yes...`
` It was..."`
`"...M‐Maria, that's incredible...`
` You really do know a lot..."`
`Jessica tried to smooth things over by praising Maria.`
`......Maybe she wanted to make sure that this was still the Maria who everyone knew so well.`
`...But Maria didn't give her any particular response.`
`Maria started fluently writing unfamiliar characters in the corners of the shape.`
`...At this sight, the eyes of Uncle Hideyoshi and Doctor Nanjo instantly began to widen...`
`"Written on the four arms of the cross are the names of the angels who preside over air, fire, water, and earth.`
` Chasan, Arel, Talihad, and Phorlakh.`
` And in the four diagonal directions are the names of the four great rulers.`
` Ariel, Seraph, Tharshis, Cherub.`
` ...Do they match?"`
`Even if you are unable to correctly write what you have seen,`
` ...if you are once again shown something identical, it isn't difficult to state that the two are the same.`
`Asked by Maria whether they matched, Uncle Hideyoshi and Doctor Nanjo nodded over and over again.`
`"It's unmistakable... Yes, these kinds of characters were definitely written there...!`
` How can you write somethin' like that......?"`
`"Th‐...there were also characters written around the circumference......"`
`"I know.`
` .................................Like this, right?"`
`Maria began jotting down Hebrew all around the circumference...`
`"It's from the Old Testament's Book of Psalms, Psalm 116, verses 16 and 17.`
` ......You must at least read the Bible.`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi......"`
`Acting as though knowing this was only common sense, Maria laughed.`
`For a while, everyone, including me, was at a loss for words.`
`{n}...After some moments, George‐aniki returned to his senses, and slowly managed to speak.`
`"......That's incredible, I'm surprised...`
` ...So, what meaning does this magic circle have?"`
`"It's a magic circle to borrow the power of the sun.`
` ......He who wears it as a talisman drawn in gold shall receive the power to break free from the bonds of any prison, and gain freedom."`
`"...Break free from the bonds,`
` ......and gain freedom...?`
` It sounds deep..."`
`"The word "bonds" is not limited in its interpretation to some kind of physical object.`
` ...Therefore it does not only hold meaning for people locked up in an actual jail.`
` It can also refer to the release from mental bonds such as ties of obligation and inescapable fate."`
`"......Ties of obligation...`
`and inescapable fate......you say?`
` ...That's also pretty deep."`
`"But I really don't understand...`
` What does this have to do with those six bodies?`
` ...Far from bein' released, they were killed and stuffed in a storehouse, weren't they?!"`
`"It's not like the magic circle was drawn for their sakes.`
` The six of them were there for the sake of the magic circle.`
` It is truly pitiable.`
` ...Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi."`
`"What do you mean...?`
` What in the world do you mean when you say the six of them were there for the sake of the magic circle?"`
`Maria lifted up her index finger and waggled it as if she were making fun of us.`
`"That's written around the circumference.`
` Can't you read?`
` Psalm 116, verses 16 and 17."`
`"......I'll read it for you.`
` "The Lord has freed me from my chains.`
` I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call on the name of the Lord."`
` ......See?"`
`"See, you say...`
` .........I have no idea what you're saying."`
`"............You're saying that...`
`...they're sacrifices?"`
`If the part that Maria had just read aloud was the vital part of the magic circle,`
` ......then it was saying that the benefit of this magic circle required sacrifices to be offered in exchange.`
`...So inside the storehouse, where the magic circle had been drawn, the sacrifices had been offered.........`
`It looked like everyone else had slowly arrived at the same conclusion.`
`...Some were shocked, others spat out "they're insane" as they punched their knees...`
`......This was starting to become a seriously disturbing story.`
`{n}...And we couldn't accept it, nor understand it.`
`......I don't care what kind of magic circles or curses other people believe in—`
`that's their right, and I won't pick a fight with them.`
`...But did they really kill Dad and the rest as sacrifices for some bullshit like that......?!`
`I just couldn't stand that feeling.`
`......I'd rather still be disgusted over all that talk around the inheritance...!`
`As I started getting pissed off with a feeling between anger and sadness, I broke from the circle everyone was in and returned once again to the window.`
`......Something had gone insane since yesterday.`
`That letter from the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, that Maria had read aloud at last night's dinner.`
`...I feel like ever since that point, we...`
`...no, this whole mansion and this whole island...have begun to be drawn into some kind of peculiar world...`
`That's right.`
` When I think back on it, that letter was an invitation from the witch.`
`The ruler of the nighttime island had invited us inhabitants of the day into another world.`
`With the phone and the radio interrupted, and the island shut off by the typhoon, you could now call it another world cut off from the real one.`
`......Yes, on this island right now, it is perfectly normal for witches to send letters, and for sacrifices to be offered to magic circles.`
`.........So what will happen next?`
`{n}Will some weird people wearing goat masks start doing the Bon Festival dance or something...?!`
`...Aah, it's no good, it's no good, I don't get it...`
`{n}The inside of my head's all screwed up, and I don't even know what to think...`
`Anger, sadness.`
`{n}The opposing emotions all swirled up together, and they started to suck me in.`
`Unable to resist, ...I could do nothing but cover my eyes with my hands and entrust my mind and body to the spiral swallowing me.........`
`.........As I started losing heart, I began to recall a distant memory.`
`It was from when I was very young.`
`I had unfortunately seen a scary occult movie on TV, and for a while, I hadn't even been able to go to the bathroom by myself.`
`...That old bastard had given an exaggerated laugh and said this:`
`......Hey, Battler.`
` Why do you think they go to all of the trouble to make movies like this about demons and the occult and such?`
`It's 'cause they don't exist. ...Something that ridiculous can't be found anywhere on the planet.`
`'Cause they don't exist, people want to see them and go to a lot of effort making them.`
` That's why those occult movies just make me laugh.`
`If you ask me, rather than demons and monsters, this year's earnings call and angry wives are a hundred million times scarier.`
`I'll go further, alright? If you ask me...`
`being scared is an emotion for the entertainment of people who have too much time on their hands and too much empty space in their minds.`
`They have so much free time they don't know what to do with it, so in order to play around with unusual emotions, they created a culture of demons and monsters and stuff.`
`.............................................`
`{n}......Seriously, why have I been acting so damn thickheaded.`
`{n}I was totally taken in.`
`.........To hell with that shit, this is the human world.`
`{n}As if I give a crap about witches, demons, magic circles and sacrifices.`
`The human who killed Dad and everyone else is still on this island.`
`{n}That's all there is, right...?!`
`Next to start speaking to my heart was Kyrie‐san.`
`You know, in chess and shogi...`
`the deeper you proceed into the mating attack, the very last moment of the endgame, the more limited your best possible moves become.`
`......Therefore, in that very moment when you're backing someone against the wall,`
` or someone is doing the same to you,`
` both players' moves become infinitely easier to read.`
`In other words, when you are completely cornered and you think you have no moves left, that is the moment when it is easiest to read your opponent.`
`......However, when a person is forced into a defensive position, they can't help but lose their ability to think clearly, so they forget to read their opponent's moves.`
`......That's when...`
`you "flip over the chessboard".`
`With all of my strength, I slapped my face with both hands.`
`{n}.........Now, my eyes were truly open.`
`When you don't understand anything, and you're completely cornered just like I am now, isn't that the perfect time to "flip over the chessboard"...!`
`With us put on the defensive, we couldn't even guess at the culprit's scheme.`
`...If you flipped it over and looked at it the other way, just how far could you see?`
`......First off, at the time the murders were committed by the culprit, they knew that the island was cut off by the typhoon.`
`So, they should have understood that even if they carried out the murders, they wouldn't be able to get away until the next morning.`
`In short, the culprit had begun without securing a way to escape.`
`Furthermore, the bastard had even tossed the corpses in the storehouse,`
` while doing the courtesy of telling us "They are here" with that weird graffiti.`
`In other words, since we would probably find the corpses sooner or later, they wanted to "show us them".`
`......If we had all been dim,`
` and hadn't noticed the storage shed, perhaps the culprit's goal "would not have been achieved"?`
`Hehe, if you think about it this way, that murdering maniac...`
`{n}Since this morning, he must have been watching our every move with bated breath.`
`After all, if we hadn't been so kind as to discover what was on the storehouse,`
` all of that hard work and preparation that they had done last night would have just gone "poof".`
`What did the culprit want to make us feel by showing us the corpses in the storehouse?`
`All six of the bodies had had their faces noticeably destroyed.`
`{n}...A grudge?`
` A warning?`
`The defacement of the bodies had occurred after death.`
`{n}So it hadn't been the means by which the culprit had murdered.`
`{n}It didn't mean anything to those who had been killed.`
`{n}...It had "meaning to those who discovered it".`
`The culprit wanted to show them to us—look how brutally I killed them!`
`Ha!`
` After thinking this way, I really want to tell that asshole to stop taking me so lightly.`
`Who would dance to that tune? If I'm told "Please be scared", I'm not just gonna say "Really? Sure thing!"`
`...When someone tells the great Ushiromiya Battler "Entrance This Way", I'm the kind of guy who'll start wanting to sneak in through the window!`
`The next thing that had me concerned was the attempt at a magic circle on the shutter.`
`...It was a genuine magic circle, declared authentic by even Maria, who had demonstrated that her knowledge of the occult rivaled Grandfather's.`
`They must have drawn that thing in pitch‐black darkness while holding an umbrella in one hand,`
` and it must have taken them a lot of time—that's a formidable amount of hard work and attention to detail.`
`What purpose would have been worth all of that effort?`
`...If something related to the occult happened in this mansion, most likely, we would all automatically suspect the involvement of Grandfather.`
`Did they want to "make us think Grandfather was involved"?`
`But if that was all they wanted, they could have just drawn any old scribble that looked like a magic circle.`
`It wasn't like any of us amateurs could tell the difference between genuine and fake.`
`...However, this magic circle was genuine, and furthermore, it had even been written in Hebrew.`
`.........So this magic circle...`
`had a message “that could only be understood by someone with knowledge of the occult”.`
`Messages are a form of communication.`
`{n}......You send them, and hope for a reaction from the other party.`
`...Reaction?`
`{n}.........For some reason, we couldn't find Grandfather now.`
`I don't know how Grandfather could have managed to see the magic circle on the shutter,`
` ...but had he chosen to hide himself in reaction to that sign...?`
`No, was it a trap to make us suspect Grandfather's involvement?`
`...You could read it either way—damn, that's annoying.`
`......What kind of reaction was the culprit hoping to get out of us by showing this imitation of the occult...?`
`Somehow, that felt like the culprit's weak point...`
`A section of {f:5:Beatrice}'s letter that Maria had read aloud during last night's dinner sprang back into my mind.`
`......The part that said "I ask that you enjoy your battle of wits".`
`Sounds like fun.`
` This is a battle of wits between us and the witch.`
`Which will be first, us being swallowed up by your occult games?`
`Or me revealing you for who you are?`
`......There's a whole day until the typhoon passes.`
`{n}Why not enjoy ourselves...?!`
`I finally noticed that the inside of the parlor had gone quiet again.`
`Everyone had sunk into their favorite sofas, some deep in thought,`
` some irritated, some depressed.`
`Maria was once again enjoying the television as if she had never left it.`
`...It looked like she found the commercials more fun than the boring program, and she happily yelled "uu‐uu" and giggled.`
`I stared at each person's appearance in turn.`
`{n}If there isn't a 19th person,`
` .........the culprit must be in this room.`
`...Right now, Aunt Natsuhi was searching the mansion with the servants, though, wasn't she?`
`......Then it shouldn't be "in this room".`
`{n}......“In this mansion” is what we should say.`
`...After all, there was also the possibility that Aunt Natsuhi was behind this,`
` ...and we still couldn't deny that one of the servants could be the killer.`
`.........Anyone could be the bad guy.`
`Still, Aunt Natsuhi and the rest sure are slow...`
`Of course, it's not a small mansion, but isn't this taking a little too long just to walk around, checking the windows and doors...?`
`Just as I thought that, Aunt Natsuhi and the rest returned.`
`Not one of them was missing.`
`{n}......But our relief was short‐lived.`
`Everyone looked at Aunt Natsuhi, shocked...`
`".........!!"`
`......The talk I'd had with Auntie Eva started to creep back into my mind.`
`The possibility that the culprits had enough in numbers,`
` or weapons, to kill all of those six at once.`
`".........Sorry if I've startled you.`
` I brought this to be prepared for the worst."`
`Because that thing in Aunt Natsuhi's hand was a rifle.`
`At a glance, its silhouette looked a lot like a hunting gun,`
` but it was unusually short, and kinda looked like a kid‐sized gun.`
`However, it had a thickness to it which revealed that this was definitely not some kid's toy.`
`"...Isn't that Kinzo‐san's gun...?"`
`"Did you know about it?`
` That's right.`
` I remembered that it was in Father's old collection, and I managed to find it."`
`"Whoa!`
` Awesome...`
` Aunt Natsuhi, is that thing real?"`
`"Yes, it's real.`
` It can fire live ammunition.`
` Long ago, Father used it to scare off wild birds."`
`"......Ah, I remember.`
` Where could that have come from?`
` No matter how much I asked him to let me touch it, he never let me lay even one finger on it."`
`"Huh...`
` Grandfather had one of these...?`
` I didn't know."`
`"Long ago, Grandfather was really addicted to westerns.`
` That generation really liked this kind of rifle."`
`"It looks like it has some considerable history to it.`
` But I've never seen one this short before."`
`"Ahhhh!`
` I remember that gun!!`
` That's the one the gunman goes firin' off with in that old movie I used to love!!`
` Father sure has good tastes...!"`
`".........Long ago, the Master had that brought over specially from America.`
` ...As you can see, it is a real gun, so I would ask that you keep this a secret..."`
`"He was quite tickled by it when he first got his hands on it.`
` It seems the workings that ejected the cartridges were more interesting to him than shooting it, and he played around with it back in the forest all the time.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho..."`
`"......Still, what a dangerous thing.`
` Are you sure you should be dragging this out?"`
`"This is preparing for the worst.`
` .........There's probably more than one of them.`
` Furthermore, they are terrifying people who killed six of us, including my husband.`
` ......I have the responsibility to protect everyone until tomorrow, in my husband's place."`
`As Natsuhi‐san said this, she slumped down into one of the sofas and took a deep breath.`
`As well as checking the doors and windows, ...she had also been trying to find Grandfather.`
`Since Grandfather was not with her, apparently his whereabouts were still unknown.`
`"...I carefully checked all of the doors and windows throughout the mansion.`
` However, we must be prepared for anything.`
` Everyone, I think it would be best if we all remained here."`
`"I agree.`
` If everyone is gathered here, then we can all feel more secure by keeping an eye on each other."`
`".........What do you mean by that, Eva‐san?"`
`"Nothing really?`
` I'm just agreeing with your opinion, aren't I?"`
`There was a dangerous atmosphere between the two of them...`
`{n}If you thought about who stood to gain the most from the inheritance problem standpoint, Auntie Eva was the obvious answer.`
`...However, there was no proof that Aunt Natsuhi was innocent.`
`......No, if you view {f:5:Beatrice}'s letter as Grandfather's elaborate prank,`
` and think of this incident as just an extension of that, there was more than enough evidence to doubt even Grandfather.`
`Aunt Natsuhi thought that the criminal was on the outside.`
`{n}...But Auntie Eva thought the criminal was on the inside.`
`In short, it was the question of whether or not a 19th person exists.`
`.........It was the doubt that had been repeated endlessly since last night's dinner, with the letter from the witch who called herself {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`......So was the culprit among us,`
` or not.`
`{n}And did the witch {f:5:Beatrice} exist,`
` or not.`
`If you assumed that something as stupid as a witch couldn't exist,`
` it was the same as saying that one of these relatives here, who shared a common bloodline, was the culprit.`
`If you didn't like that, it would be much more comfortable to simply accept the fairy tale about the witch.`
`............Did a witch do it?`
`{n}Draw that weird magic circle and sacrifice those people?`
`If I could only accept that rubbish, ...I would be able to completely trust everyone in this room.`
`However, damn common sense got in the way.`
`{n}......It kept repeating that witches don't exist.`
`......In that case,`
` ............the culprit was among us...`
`In the middle of the seemingly endless rain, none of us could break our silence...`
`Lunch had ended, and the servants had removed the tableware, and were now in the kitchen.`
`{n}The wind and rain had neither weakened nor strengthened, and the island remained cut off from the outside world.`
`It seemed that, at first, Natsuhi had planned not to let anyone set one foot outside the room,`
` but when it came time to prepare lunch, she finally realized that this was impossible.`
`However, in order to avoid having anyone alone in the kitchen, she told the three servants to go together.`
`Because of that, the servants were the first ones given the right to leave the stuffy parlor, which had been packed with eleven people.`
`......Since breakfast had immediately followed that terrible incident,`
` and many of them hadn't eaten much, everyone tore into their lunches in silence.`
`"I will wash the dishes, so you can rest a while, Genji‐san, Kanon‐kun.`
` ...Do you want something to drink?"`
`".........Nothing for me.`
` .........Kanon?"`
`"......Nothing for me either."`
`"You two must have been so busy, and so early in the morning...`
` It's no wonder you're worn out..."`
`The only sound was that of Kumasawa washing the dishes, which resounded throughout the kitchen.`
`Genji and Kanon sat in some chairs a short distance away, their eyes lightly closed.`
`Just as Kumasawa had said, those two had probably built up a great deal of fatigue.`
`But that didn't mean they could let it show in front of the relatives.`
`...Avoiding that was one of their virtues.`
`After the silence had continued for some time,`
` .........Kanon opened his mouth and muttered.`
`"...............Shannon...`
` ...............Why...did she have to die in such a horrible way...?"`
`"......Forget about how she died.`
` .........It was nothing more than...bad luck."`
`".........You're right.`
` ...It was nothing more than bad luck..."`
`They both fell silent once again.`
` ...Kanon's expression was filled with grief.`
`"To think that Shannon‐chan's actually dead...`
` I still can't believe it.`
` ......Poor, poor Shannon‐chan...`
` ......Not being able to meet her again feels like a lie...`
` I just wanted to see that girl's smiling face one more time..."`
`Kumasawa spoke with her back facing them.`
`...Kumasawa hadn't seen Shannon's corpse,`
` so she had no trouble mentioning Shannon's face.`
`...When Kanon heard those words, it reminded him again of how only half of Shannon's face had been left, and his grieving expression twisted even further...`
`".........Why did {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama do that to Shannon...?`
` ......If she wanted a sacrifice, there were plenty of others to choose from...`
` ......Why... ......Why...?!"`
`".........It was nothing more than bad luck.`
` ...If chance had fallen even slightly differently, it could have been me or you lying out there."`
`"Or even someone else.`
` ......Everything is left to fate."`
`"Genji‐sama.`
` .........You said that the door to Madam's room was stained with traces of something like blood, right...?`
` The same substance that was painted on the shutter?"`
`"......Yes.`
` ...It was an unpleasant mark.`
` Almost as though someone with blood‐stained fingers had been trying to pull out the doorknob,`
` ...no, scratch through the door...`
` ...That sort of unpleasant mark."`
`"So does this mean that...{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama came to visit Madam's room,`
` ......and tried to open the door, but...`
`couldn't...?`
` Is that what this means...?"`
`Genji thought back to the time he had seen those traces of blood on the door to Natsuhi's room...`
`With the substance sticking to the door around the doorknob, and the marks of something scratching against the door...`
`it had definitely appeared as though someone had tried to open the door,`
` but couldn't...`
`"...Why...`
`......was Madam not chosen as a sacrifice...?`
` If only she had been chosen,`
` ......Shannon wouldn't,`
` ......Shannon wouldn't have had to die..."`
`Just then, a loud, sharp noise resounded from the hall.`
`{n}Both of them turned around, surprised.`
`"........................Sounds like a pretty interesting discussion you're having.`
` Let me join in too."`
`Battler was standing in the doorway to the kitchen.`
`"......Battler‐sama.`
` Please, excuse me..."`
`Genji‐san and Kanon‐kun stood up, surprised, and hastily bowed.`
`...But I didn't care about stuff like that.`
`{n}I was more concerned with continuing their discussion.`
`"I told them I was going to the bathroom, so they let me go.`
` I thought I'd suffocate if I was locked up in that room any longer."`
`"...When I was about to come ask you for some water, I overheard something pretty interesting.`
` ......You don't need to bow your heads or anything.`
` Please, let me hear the rest."`
`"............That just now......wasn't really......"`
`"I've been listening to you for a while.`
` Don't try to hide it now."`
`"............So I'll ask directly.`
` ...Who is this {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` She's supposed to be a witch from a kid's story, but it doesn't look that way now."`
`"........................"`
`Kanon‐kun averted his gaze.`
`...It was obvious that he didn't want to talk about this,`
` ...which only made me want to ask even more.`
`While making an effort to smile, I grabbed the collar of his shirt.`
`"......If it were last night, this'd be none of my business.`
` But after this morning, everything's changed.`
` Now that Dad and the rest have been killed, this is totally my business.`
` .........I have the right to listen to this suspicious story, don't I...?"`
`I glared into Kanon‐kun's eyes as he still continued to look away, in apparent pain.`
`...Since there was a big difference in our heights, Kanon‐kun had to stand on his toes, and it looked like it hurt a bit.`
`"............Battler‐san...`
` ...Please let go of him...`
` It's not like Kanon‐san is really hiding anything..."`
`"Then you won't have any problem talking about it, right?`
` It's lonely being out of the loop, get it?"`
`When I tried to further twist up his collar, Genji‐san cut between us and spoke.`
`...There was a slight sense of resignation on his face.`
`{n}......It looked like he didn't plan on hiding anything.`
`".........I can talk about it.`
` ......Kanon only hesitated because you might have taken it badly, Battler‐sama..."`
`"Hesitating isn't very manly, is it?`
` Keeping it a secret's even more unpleasant."`
`"......Tell me about it.`
` It's not like I have anything better to do before tomorrow comes.`
` A slightly shady story might be the best way to stave off boredom."`
`After Genji‐san and Kanon‐kun looked at each other, they nodded as though they had decided to talk...`
`"......Understood.`
` Please ask us anything.`
` ............We will talk."`
`"Right.`
` Then I'll ask."`
`"......Who in the world is {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` ...All I know is that she's a witch who lives in the forest of Rokkenjima.`
` ...I've heard that it's a story that Grandmother or someone invented to keep people out of the dangerous forest.`
` ......Is that wrong?"`
`"............No, ...it isn't wrong.`
` It's as you say.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is a witch who dwells in the forest of Rokkenjima."`
`"......Battler‐sama.`
` .........I don't expect you to believe this all of a sudden, but...`
`{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama exists.`
` ...She is a real person, the one who gave the Master a vast amount of gold and who has worked by his side for many years."`
`"Huh...?`
` Ah, come on...`
` Is Grandfather paying you to repeat everything he says...?"`
`I laughed like it was a joke,`
` but neither Genji‐san nor Kanon‐kun laughed,`
` ......not even Kumasawa baa‐chan, who avoided my eyes, flustered, and started washing the utensils.`
`So unfortunately, I was the only one laughing.`
` ...Painfully, bitterly.`
`"......I see now why you warned me, Genji‐san.`
` ...Anyone sane would take this badly.`
` ............So you're saying that a person named {f:5:Beatrice} actually exists?"`
`"......Yes.`
` She has been working for the Master since before the mansion was built on this island.`
` ...Most likely, she has been working for him even longer than I have."`
`"What do you know, Kyrie‐san's theory was off...`
` ......Grandfather really did have a confidante called {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......And she's on the island now...?"`
`"...............Yes.`
` I believe that she is here."`
`"...That's a vague way to say it.`
` I guess that means you haven't seen her face today or yesterday."`
`"......Yes.`
` ......It is extremely difficult to say, but...`
`...umm..."`
`Kanon‐kun once again dropped his gaze, avoiding my eyes.`
`"...Come on, don't just stop there.`
` That's like freezing an inch before the blow!"`
`I urged him on jokingly.`
`...However, it looked like Kanon‐kun was still unsure as to whether he should speak or not.`
`.........Then, Kumasawa baa‐chan whispered.`
`"...Hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` You cannot see her face,`
` .........because {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama has no form..."`
`"............She has no...`
`......what?"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama has no body.`
` ...Therefore, unless {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama wishes it, common people like us are not able to see her form."`
`"I have heard that the portrait shows what {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama looked like back when she had a human form...`
` ......I hear she often lingers in front of the portrait, yearning for her old form...`
` ...Hoh‐hoh‐ho..."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama sometimes changes her form into glittering butterflies and shows herself.`
` ......On the rare occasion that you spot them somewhere in the mansion, there is a rule that you absolutely mustn't chase after them."`
`"It is whispered that you will meet with disaster if you follow them.`
` ...In fact, there was a servant who broke that rule and quit because of a great injury."`
`"......Wait a sec, are you kidding me?`
` Are you all serious about this......?"`
`"...Battler‐sama, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama has already arrived.`
` Such language may be unwise."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is not fond of those who profane her.`
` ......If you doubt her existence, you will surely meet with disaster."`
`"Battler‐san... You probably find this story unpleasant.`
` But you know what?`
` {f:5:Beatrice} does "exist", okay?"`
`"......She "exists".`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama has an exceptional dislike of that being called into question."`
`"............Don't you understand, Battler‐sama?`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama has already arrived here..."`
`"...Come on, quit it.`
` I'm weak against that stuff, you know...?`
` You're freaking me out..."`
`However, there was no trace of a joke in the eyes of the three servants.`
`On the surface, I laughed and tried to look unconcerned, but I was quickly starting to sober up.`
`{n}...Their eyes were also sobering up fast.`
`"......Battler‐san... I beg that you stop profaning {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` Please trust me..."`
`Kumasawa baa‐chan, who was usually cheerful and would always tease people,`
` ......now spoke with a totally straight face that I had never known her to make.`
`".........W‐......well...`
` Sure you say she exists...`
` But I don't see anything...`
` Are you trying to say that she's standing right next to me or something?`
` Quit joking around..."`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi......"`
`Just then, that unnerving laugh suddenly filled the kitchen...`
`...When I turned around, Maria was standing there by the entrance.`
`{n}...But her expression and the feeling about her, her presence...felt exactly the same as the servants.`
`"...Whether your wavelength matches or not is determined at birth.`
` Battler, you were born with a mismatched wavelength.`
` That's why you can't see her,`
` can't meet with her,`
` can't talk to her."`
`"...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` You're the type {f:5:Beatrice} hates the most."`
`Maria's laugh sounded like she was greatly enjoying herself, ...yet it was extremely eerie.`
`......It was almost like she was laughing at me because I alone didn't understand.`
`"Do you want to know about {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` ............{f:5:Beatrice} is a thousand‐year‐old witch.`
` ......She has all the demons at her command, and can harness the power of alchemy to create the philosopher's stone and a vast quantity of gold.`
` Grandfather built up all of the vast wealth of the Ushiromiya family by making a contract with her."`
`"......Yesterday, I read {f:5:Beatrice}'s letter, didn't I?`
` That was real.`
` ...Well, I guess it's pointless for me to try and force you to believe."`
`"...After all, it looks like you were born without a trace of the sixth sense.`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi...!"`
`"......What are you talking about?`
` Witches, demons?`
` Who told you that...?"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihi.`
` I heard it from {f:5:Beatrice} herself.`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!"`
`Maria kept doing that unpleasant laugh.`
`{n}...However, the servants who watched over this didn't even blink.`
`She heard it from...that witch in the portrait adorning the entrance hall.`
`{n}Maria kept on laughing in a weird voice, as though this was nothing more or less than the truth...`
`"...Maria, it might be rude to ask, but I'll ask one more time, okay...?`
` Who gave you that letter yesterday?"`
`"I got it from {f:5:Beatrice}. How many times must I tell you before you understand?"`
`"......You don't get it, do you?`
` You can't see her, I know.`
` You can't believe it, I know!`
` ...Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi."`
`Just then, Maria's laughter suddenly stopped.`
`".........Battler.`
` You still can't tell?`
` That {f:5:Beatrice} "exists"."`
`"She "exists", you say.........but where?"`
`"Like I said, {f:5:Beatrice} "exists", right here."`
`......That's right.`
`{n}Now that I think about it, I've been feeling for some time now that the others haven't been looking in quite the right direction.`
`...I'd figured that everyone had just been gazing into the distance, but......that wasn't the case.`
`The four here—Genji‐san,`
` Kanon‐kun,`
` Kumasawa‐san,`
` ...and Maria—`
` ......everyone except me—`
` ...............was looking at a spot right behind me......`
`Holding my breath tightly, I slowly looked over my shoulder.`
`...Of course, there wasn't anyone there.`
`{n}I've known that the whole time!`
`.........However, everyone in the room except me was focusing on that point as if there was someone there.`
`"{f:5:Beatrice} is a great witch of gold who has lived for one thousand years.`
` ......But she can't show her form to humans of the wrong wavelength, and she can't talk to them."`
`"...And you know what?`
` She finds that really sad.`
` ...That's why she truly despises it when people like you, who were born without a fragment of magic sensitivity, deny that she exists...!"`
`".........You're lucky, Battler.`
` Good thing that I gave you that charm yesterday, right?`
` Who knows what kind of curse {f:5:Beatrice} would have put on you by now if you hadn't been carrying it around.`
` ...You really are lucky, Battler.`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi...!"`
`".........Right, that scorpion keyholder.`
` I'd thought that was just some cheap gift or something, but I guess it really had some benefit, then?"`
`"Kihihihihihihihi.`
` If it weren't for that, you'd be lying in that storehouse as a sacrifice with your face crushed by now.`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi, you're so lucky, Battler...!`
` Kihhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!"`
`"......I see.`
` So if it weren't for that, I'd have been killed by now......"`
`"Battler, why don't you believe in {f:5:Beatrice}...?`
` Even though she "exists".`
` Right now, over there, look."`
`"Kihihihihihihihi!`
` Hey, I'll bet you want to believe it now.`
` Believe it.`
` And thank me for giving you that charm...!"`
`"If it weren't for that, you'd be in the storehouse right now.`
` But then, maybe you would have saved someone else in exchange, right?`
` Kihhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!"`
`Pff...!`
`......Right then, I burst into laughter.`
`{n}Playing witches had been pretty fun up until a second ago, but unfortunately, that last one didn't quite hit the mark.`
`"Hahahahahahah.`
` ......Then it's no goddamn good at all, is it, Maria?`
` If that's true, then I'm sorry, but it's no goddamn good at all."`
`When Maria saw me suddenly start laughing, she stopped.`
`{n}Even though she didn't understand what I was laughing at, she realized it wouldn't be pleasant for her.`
`".............................."`
`"I thought it might hurt you, so I didn't say it earlier, but..."`
`"......Although I thought I'd put that charm you gave me in my pocket,`
` I must have dropped it somewhere, you see?"`
`"......That means the charm can't be the reason I'm alive now, and even though I should have been cursed by the witch, I'm perfectly fine.`
` ......Sorry, but I don't believe in things I don't see with my own eyes."`
`"Sixth sense?`
` Wavelengths?`
` Magic sensitivity?`
` Sorry, but I don't believe in fake stuff like that.`
` When I hear the girls in class start talking about how good or bad their ability to sense the supernatural is, it pisses me off!"`
`"...I don't know how much Grandfather is paying you, but if you're trying to talk me into joining some cult,`
` believe me, you won't be able to do it that easily."`
`"...............Battler‐sama..."`
`"...You guys are free to believe whatever you want.`
` But when it comes to whether I believe or not,`
` that is always`
` for me`
` to decide!"`
`"Sorry, but I can't believe in something as shady as {f:5:Beatrice} until I've seen her with my own eyes...!!"`
`I spoke forcefully and sharply...`
`{n}When I did, Maria started cackling again.`
`"Kihhihihihihihihihihihihi...!`
` Well that's just fine, isn't it...?`
` Eventually, even people like you with totally mismatched wavelengths will be able to see {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`".........Very soon, she will revive.`
` {f:5:Beatrice} will revive.`
` ......Once that happens, she's promised to talk with me and play with me a lot."`
`"...There's neither a need to doubt nor to force yourself to believe.`
` ......She will appear, very soon.`
` Kihihihihihihihihihi...!"`
`Some people usually head to the bathroom after a meal; others prefer to take a short nap.`
`It seemed that several people had gone out of the parlor, just like I did when I went to the kitchen to drink some water.`
`In the end, Aunt Natsuhi's order to keep everyone packed together in the parlor was reluctantly withdrawn, under the conditions that:`
` no one was to be on their own,`
` and no one was to go far from the parlor.`
`After all, if eleven people are shut up in the same room starting early in the morning, the air will start to stagnate.`
`...And now that a little time had passed,`
` everyone had started to recover from the shock of that morning—maybe their sense of danger was weakening over time, too.`
`......However, it was a certain fact that six people had been killed inside this mansion,`
` so no one was completely negligent.`
`So when they went out into the hallway for a breath of fresh air, trying to act tough,`
` ......they would get scared of standing there, isolated, and would end up returning to the parlor.`
`...Like that fable.`
` You know, "The North Wind and the Sun".`
`{n}If you force someone to stay shut in, they'll resist, but if you tell them to do whatever they want, they'll come back, obediently.`
`People sure are hypocrites.`
`.........When the servants finished cleaning up from the meal,`
` they returned obediently to the parlor just as Aunt Natsuhi had told them to, and sat in a sofa near the entrance, patiently awaiting orders.`
`Maria, almost as though she had suddenly finished playing witches,`
` had returned to the pure Maria I knew well, saying "uu‐uu".`
`...What in the world was that back there?`
`{n}.........I hadn't felt even an atom of the presence of this person called {f:5:Beatrice}, supposedly standing behind me, invisible.`
`...However, it felt like, inside Maria, I could catch a glimpse of a little of that presence...`
`"You're right.`
` When Maria‐chan starts talking about witches, she changes.`
` ...Battler‐kun, you also saw it down by the beach yesterday, right?"`
`"You mean when she gave me that scorpion keyholder?`
` ...No, I don't mean like when her feelings were hurt,`
` I'm talking about when she looked like she had, you know, a dual personality."`
`"Aah, that happens sometimes too.`
` ......Just like when Maria started talking about the magic circle, not very often, but it happens.`
` It's freaky though."`
`Apparently, according to Jessica, the "Kihihihihihi" laughing Maria shows up every now and then.`
`This was just bad timing, and furthermore, it was the first time I'd seen it, so it really shocked me...`
`"So what is that?`
` Does Maria have a dual personality or something?`
` Or are you saying that her spiritual sense really is that strong, and she gets possessed by stuff like that?"`
`"...No, I don't think it's that.`
` Didn't you ever experience it?`
` A desire to be someone other than yourself, when you were small."`
`Right when humans are born, no one has any individuality.`
`{n}However, when they reach their growth period, and their sense of self starts to be born, they start to gain a sense of individuality.`
`They want to be different from other people.`
`...But of course, they will find that they're no different from the others in their class,`
` since they are learning the same thing in school and forced into the same lifestyle.`
`When they realize that, they start off by breaking the rules, in what's called the rebellious age.`
`{n}Since everyone follows the rules, they want to show off their individuality by breaking them.`
`...Even those who call everyone around them babies and stir up trouble...`
`are just cute kids searching for themselves when you look at them this way.`
`......Well, I'm lecturing about all this like I'm so smart, but I actually got it second‐hand from George‐aniki.`
`I myself was one of those embarrassing guys who thought it was cool to act like a little bastard...`
`Well, that was when I was the age where you try standing out for the opposite sex.`
`"At the very foundation of the growing period is an impulse to escape from being a kid, much the same as a chick trying to crack the shell of their egg.`
` Do you know what the difference between a child and an adult is?"`
`"Age?`
` Or physique?"`
`"No, it's experience.`
` Adults look down on children because children have very little life experience.`
` The reason they snort and look down on children whenever they say anything is because children don't know anything about the world."`
`"Yeah, I know what you mean.`
` When you're a kid, you try to say things like you've got life all figured out, and try to act like an adult.`
` ...No matter what a kid says, adults will just snort at them because they're too naive or because they'd "understand once they grew up" or something."`
`"...Well, it's probably true, but to a kid, it's just annoying, like they're being looked down upon."`
`"......I get it.`
` It's about whether they have knowledge and experience.`
` ...You're right, you don't earn respect just by becoming old and not achieving anything."`
`"Therefore, what we have is: a period where they have the impulse to escape from being a kid; and also, they want to have individuality, different from other people.`
` If what separates kids and adults is knowledge and experience, then...?"`
`"............I get it, if they know something that no one else knows, that's one way to form an identity."`
`"When you're in, like, elementary school, if you knew stuff no one else knew,`
` had stuff no one else had, wore stuff no one else wore, you could become a bit of a hero for it.`
` I bet you did the same thing, Battler."`
`"Yeah, yeah.`
` There was definitely an age when I wanted to excel in something.`
` ...I see, that was because I was trying to separate myself from being a child, my growing period."`
`"If you look at it in a good way, the growing period, by forcing you to separate yourself from others, pushes you to gain skills and knowledge that no one else has."`
`"...This is also interesting from a sociological standpoint.`
` Because people hate being like everyone else, they try to learn skills that other people don't know.`
` In this way, society can acquire the broad range of skills it needs to survive.`
` ...The quality of the gods' programming is truly surprising."`
`"Well, individual personalities can also be negative, right?`
` Like saying, everyone else in the class is studying hard, so I'll slack off so I stick out."`
`...That was actually me.`
`{n}It was only recently that I'd finally been able to feel thankful towards that middle school teacher who had slapped me after school.`
`"But, well, I did have those desires to jump over the vaulting box that no one else could,`
` or sprint as fast as I could trying to lap those guys with good grades when we did a marathon."`
`"...It was in my nature that, if I couldn't study well, then at least I could get back at them by exercising.`
` ......I get it, I really went all out during my growing period."`
`"I guess boys do tend to focus more on physical things."`
`"But you know? Girls of the same age tend to focus more on emotional things.`
` ......I'll bet there were groups of girls in your classes that were really interested in like, fortune telling and their spiritual senses."`
`"Yeah, yeah! There was, there was!`
` They'd come over, asking me for my sign and my blood type! And then they'd laugh, "Aah, I thought so, *giggle*giggle*!"`
` It really got on my nerves."`
`"No matter which class you go to, girls like fortune telling.`
` There was always a group that went on about spirit senses being strong or weak, or "sensitivity", or seeing things that can't be seen."`
`"That's because fortune telling and spiritual senses are things that aren't taught in school.`
` To girls, who unlike guys are more introverted,`
` that's a genre which is easy to build an identity upon, and one that they find very interesting."`
`"Just like when boys enter their growing period, and start acting tough and rebelling against adults,`
` when girls enter their growing period, they start getting interested in that kind of thing instead.`
` ......Well, not me though!"`
`"......So Maria having so much interest in the occult isn't that rare among girls her age?"`
`...Even if you accept that, ...I wonder if it explains that creepy dual personality thing...`
`............Well, I think I can accept it vaguely.`
`"As I said before, becoming an adult means gaining knowledge and experience.`
` So kids must study various things so that they can gain knowledge and truly awaken."`
`"...There is a specific kind of fantasy useful for this, which is and has always been prolific in the world of children.`
` Do you know what that is?"`
`"You see it all the time in manga and anime, right?`
` You know.`
` Like, memories coming back to you from a former life.`
` Or like, channeling the soul of the great whatever."`
`"Ah, there's also sleeping genes awakening,`
` or sealed powers or memories returning...there's a lot of versions.`
` For some reason, those kinds of things are really popular at that age.`
` ...Why's that?"`
`"All of those examples you've just mentioned are fantasies by which children can immediately add knowledge and experience to their childhood selves.`
` Even a nine‐year‐old girl simply has to say that she has a thousand‐year‐old witch possessing her,`
` and she can gain a 1009‐year‐old identity."`
`"So what you're saying is that for people who think studying is annoying,`
` but want to learn different skills from everyone else and brag about it, and get attention from it, it's a convenient delusion."`
`So you can brag about something without having to work hard or study.`
`{n}......I see, isn't that a kid's greatest dream?`
`"Furthermore, their ideal self image is always self‐projected onto their desires to escape from being a kid,`
` and it's not rare for that desired form to become established as an alternate personality."`
`"Even you, Battler‐kun, I'm sure your character is a little different at home and at school, right?`
` It would probably be embarrassing if anyone at school saw how you were at home.`
` At school, you try to project yourself as you want to be, but home is where you are your true self."`
`".........So, in other words, I'm changing my character for different situations.`
` ......Are you trying to say that having multiple personalities is actually really common?"`
`"A girl who is a fan of the occult might say that she's being possessed, or has awakened.`
` Honestly, there are some kids who can change their personalities so drastically, it can change your whole opinion of them."`
`"......Even some boys, right?`
` Guys who just blow their top and get violent over nothing.`
` I bet they think it's pretty cool, but it's painful to watch."`
`"So let's sum this all up.`
` ...Girls of about Maria's age, even if they show a creepy second personality like she did a minute ago,`
` you're saying that's not such a rare thing...?"`
`"If you bring it all together simply, that's what it means.`
` ...Identity is an important thing used to build up one's sense of self.`
` If you make fun of that, it could actually cause children to go back into their shell."`
`"So it's important to go along with them to some degree.`
` ...Although to accept it completely requires the tolerance of a parent."`
`"......Aniki, I can't believe you aren't married...`
` You sound like you've already raised kids through middle school.`
` .........Then, I wonder if Auntie Rosa also knew much about Maria's dual personality."`
`"She knew.`
` .........Just between us, Auntie Rosa couldn't friggin' stand it.`
` She said it was creepy, and it was just making Maria more and more separated from the rest of the class."`
`"So any time Maria started talking about the occult or laughing like a witch, she'd slap her.`
` ...And it looks like Maria stopped talking that way in front of her."`
`.........Maybe it was just a little game, from a girl facing her growing period,`
` ...that thing that had happened back there.`
`Just a girl trying to show that she was different and independent by holding interest in witches and the occult.`
`...And since she wanted to have another side to herself that wasn't infantile, she was switching between her normal personality and the personality of her ideal, a witch.`
`.........In the beginning, I had found that very disturbing,`
` but after George‐aniki's lecture, it felt like this was a path that everyone walked down at one time or another.`
`......I haven't told anyone, but when I was in kindergarten,`
` I joined up with a little gang of kids trying to form a Earth Defense Force, saying we'd help protect peace on earth.`
`My face turns red when I remember how, during what we called battle practice, we would chant "EDF! EDF!"...`
`Just like usual, Maria was relaxing,`
` immersed in the TV, "uu‐uu"ing and laughing just like any girl her age.`
`......But on the inside, another personality, that of the ideal witch that she admired and blindly accepted, was sleeping.`
`But that wasn't anything extraordinary; it was perfectly natural for a girl of her age...`
`............I calmed down a little.`
`{n}I had started to recover from the shock of my bizarre experience in the kitchen.`
`...If I hadn't talked to Aniki and Jessica, I might still have been frightened by the idea that an invisible witch was standing right behind me.`
`...However, ......can I really accept that as an explanation of what happened back there?`
`If it had just been Maria, I could have explained it as the fickle fantasies of a growing girl.`
`...But Genji‐san, Kanon‐kun, and Kumasawa baa‐chan had also been there.`
`None of them had denied what Maria said.`
`.........They had silently accepted that {f:5:Beatrice} "exists".`
`I was starting to feel a little uneasy...`
`Auntie Eva had claimed that no 19th person exists,`
` saying that someone within the family had committed the crime in connection with their messy quarrel.`
`On the other hand, Aunt Natsuhi had claimed that the culprit was hiding somewhere outside the mansion.`
`That meant that she was denying that the crime had been committed by one of us, and accepting that a 19th person exists.`
`And in the kitchen, Maria and the servants had agreed that a 19th person exists.`
`But according to them, this 19th person isn't human.`
`{n}......They had said that it was an invisible witch, plotting something mysterious.`
`Is there a 19th person, or not?`
`{n}And is the culprit a human, or a witch?`
`For some reason, I couldn't just laugh off any of the possibilities.`
`{n}...Not even the most ridiculous one about the witch.`
`"......Jessica,`
` all I know about the story of the witch is that it was a story made by the adults to keep the kids too scared to enter the forest, but...`
`...is it different here in the mansion...?"`
`"............Hmmm...`
` I'm with you on this."`
`"I think it was just a dumb ghost story made by the parents so their kids would listen to them.`
` ......But I can't deny that the atmosphere inside the mansion makes it a little hard to say it out loud..."`
`"......Because Grandfather has proclaimed that {f:5:Beatrice} does exist.`
` And because of their position, the servants can't doubt that.`
` Jessica's mother and father don't want to get into a fight with him either, so on the surface, they go along with it."`
`"......So you could probably say that, inside this mansion, doubting the existence of {f:5:Beatrice} is a kind of taboo.`
` Unlike the rest of us, who only come here once a year.`
` ......Is that right?"`
`Jessica puffed out air in admiration...`
`{n}It looked like Aniki had guessed right.`
`"......You've got it totally.`
` No one really believes it on the inside.`
` ...But on the outside, they accept she exists."`
`"See, it's just like the way some people are about gods.`
` Even if you know there's actually no such thing, it feels rude to actually say that out loud..."`
`"......How do you think the servants feel about it amongst themselves?`
` Is it true that, since Grandfather who employs them says she "exists", they have to go along with it...?"`
`"Well...`
` I don't really know the details,`
` ......but between the servants, the story about {f:5:Beatrice} has been treated a bit like a ghost story."`
`"...Remember yesterday, when Shannon was talking to us down by the beach?`
` About how they saw unsettling things while doing the rounds in the mansion at night."`
`She had said something like that, hadn't she...`
`Back then, I didn't give it much thought, assuming she was just going along with the displeased Maria,`
` ...but now that I think about it, she did say that, and completely seriously.`
`......That's right.`
` She definitely said it.`
`...She definitely said the same kind of thing that Genji‐san and the rest had all unanimously declared back in the kitchen...`
`"In addition, some servants have also seen will‐o'‐the‐wisps and glittering butterflies dancing around.`
` ......Kanon‐kun also said he saw something like that when he went patrolling one night."`
`"And recently, the servants have been talking about strange footsteps inside the mansion near midnight.`
` We have whispered together that the {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama from the portrait sometimes walks through the mansion invisible."`
`"...It happened a long time ago, but I have also heard those kinds of footsteps while patrolling at night."`
`......That's right.`
` She definitely said that.`
`{n}Exactly the same thing that I had been told just now.`
`"Ah, ...but, there's nothing to be afraid of, you know?`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is another ruler of this mansion separate from the Master.`
` So, she won't do anything bad, as long as you respect her and don't act oddly afraid."`
`"However, she's fearsome if you don't respect her, right?"`
`"...Yes.`
` I heard that someone who quit just before I began working, after falling down the stairs and receiving a large injury to their back,`
` had been speaking badly of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` Because of that, there was a rumor between the servants that {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's anger had been brought down upon this person..."`
`"......If you don't respect her, her anger will be brought down upon you, and you will be injured.`
` ...So, to the servants, {f:5:Beatrice}'s existence...`
`is just as credible as the story that, if you pull pranks on {c:86EF9C:Inari‐san}, you will be cursed by the {c:86EF9C:kitsune}."`
`Of course, even though everyone accepts that curses and the like don't exist in the modern era,`
` ...people are still afraid and still have a little respect for them.`
`You see it a lot even in residential areas, such as when someone is building a house, and they call a Shinto priest for a ceremony to honor the god of that plot of land.`
`...You might think that's just a big waste of time and money,`
` but the workers say that a big accident will occur if they don't do it, so they apparently never neglect the procedure.`
`You also hear about how, if an Inari shrine is carelessly removed during a town replanning,`
` there would be a curse by Kitsune‐sama.`
`I think I might have read somewhere that when the occupying forces were trying to expand an airport, and had to remove an Inari‐san that was in the way,`
` all of the workers were suddenly taken out by some mysterious fever.`
`Even in modern cities like Tokyo,`
` it isn't rare to see modern buildings packed all around an old Inari shrine, leaving the shrine itself untouched.`
`And this isn't limited to Japan.`
`{n}It's probably similar to how people baptize babies.`
`If I remember correctly, by the Christian doctrine,`
` unbaptized souls, though their sin is the lightest, still fulfill the conditions for going to hell.`
`Putting water on a child's forehead doesn't do anything but make them cry.`
`But if a parent can prevent their child from going to hell with just that little effort, they will happily go through with that ceremony.`
`......In short, even in this modern society of reason,`
` we are still unable to throw away every trace of belief and fear.`
`...You could say that it's a passive acceptance of the supernatural.`
`Maybe the only difference on this island was that {f:5:Beatrice} was the name that was respected here...`
`"...So, in other words,`
` if anything happens that doesn't seem explainable in human terms, it's called the work of {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`".........I think Shannon‐chan was talking about it.`
` About windows and doors that had definitely been properly shut or locked being open the next time they were checked.`
` Lights that had been off being on, and lights that had been on being off."`
`"......And, if I remember right, Jessica, you used to joke that it was {f:5:Beatrice}'s doing that you couldn't find your bag sometimes when you went to leave in the morning, right?"`
`"Good memory.`
` ...Normally, you'd say a fairy took them, but on this island, it's {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Man, what a stupid story."`
`"This mansion has been standing for about thirty years by now, hasn't it?`
` It's natural for things that old to get their fair share of ghost and occult stories.`
` Like the seven mysteries at a school."`
`"...............So here...`
`is where we "flip over the chessboard"."`
`"Huh?"`
`".........Basically, on this island, there's a rule that {f:5:Beatrice} can be blamed for anything that couldn't have been done by humans.`
` Anything that the humans can't do.`
` ......How many humans are there?`
` There's 18."`
`"............In other words, the culprit is modelling things after this rule, trying to make it appear that this crime was the work of the witch.`
` In short, they desperately want to claim this as the doing of a 19th person."`
`"............{i:I don't like it}.`
` I really don't like it."`
`"What don't you like...?"`
`"............Just assume that an invisible 19th person existed, and that this person wanted to make it known that they existed.`
` ......If it were me, I'd do it with more perfect timing."`
`"......What do you mean by perfect timing?"`
`"...Well.`
` After all, the crime took place after midnight while it was still dark, right?`
` People were talking together until midnight, some people had the night shift, and some people had returned to their rooms and were sleeping."`
`"...Everyone's alibi is really vague, and there's plenty of room to suspect that the crime was committed by one of us.`
` George‐aniki, Auntie Eva probably told you too, right?`
` That there's a good chance that one of us is the culprit?"`
`"...mh......yes.`
` ...I guess."`
`"......In other words, if the 19th person really existed and wanted to show themselves, this first crime was a complete failure."`
`"...No, in the first place, the timing was a mistake.`
` If this invisible 19th person really wanted to show themselves,`
` they had to make sure that the crime took place {i:under conditions which proved that the remaining twelve people were all innocent}."`
`"Unless there are no suspicious humans, they can't prove that they exist.`
` So by killing them in the middle of the night, when everyone's alibi was at its most ambiguous,`
` whether or not this 19th person exists was also at its most ambiguous.`
` Even so, they chose that time to commit the crime."`
`"......By committing the crime then, it's obvious that one of the 18 would be suspected.`
` ...Yet they took the name of the witch and handed Maria the letter, and everyone denies doing it."`
`"In other words, ......you're trying to say that one of the 18 is trying to make it look like a 19th person called {f:5:Beatrice} exists...?"`
`"That's pretty crazy......`
` ...I think my mom's theory that someone is hiding outside the mansion is a little more credible...`
` ...Battler, don't tell me you actually suspect that someone in this room is the culprit...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ...Someone trying to force us to accept that {f:5:Beatrice} exists.`
` ......That's right, the letter last night is when this whole thing started.`
` ...I don't have any basis or proof, but..."`
`"......With the chessboard upside‐down, this is my best guess."`
`"......Seriously, that's too crazy...`
` Haven't you been reading too many weird detective novels...?"`
`"But it does hit on a point that we can't ignore.`
` ......Whether there's a 19th person or not,`
` the culprit is definitely planning something based around that rule about this island."`
`"......Just now, listening to Battler‐kun talk, I remembered something that's a little disturbing."`
`"Something disturbing...?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......Do you remember?`
` {f:5:Beatrice}'s letter.`
` ......It said that {f:5:Beatrice} was going to collect interest.`
` And as for what that interest is, it said: everything of the Ushiromiya family."`
`Jessica and I thought back on what Maria had read aloud the previous night...`
`"...It said that.`
` It definitely said that.`
` That the collecting of the interest would now take place, but if the riddle of the gold could be solved, she would lose that right."`
`"...Grandfather was granted the gold, and the Ushiromiya house prospered.`
` Basically, {f:5:Beatrice} is saying that everything he birthed from that gold counts as interest.`
` ......In other words—"`
`".........That's pretty scary for a joke, Aniki...`
` ......Don't tell me that everything of the Ushiromiya family—`
`in other words, everything that Grandfather gave birth to—`
`refers to everyone with Grandfather's blood flowing through their veins...?!"`
`"If you read the letter that way,`
` ...these murders are just {f:5:Beatrice} legitimately collecting interest.`
` ...If that's the case, these crimes will continue.`
` ...Because the collection of interest is still only halfway completed."`
`George turned around, looking over the parlor.`
`{n}......There were still many people who held the name Ushiromiya.`
`And we knew that, since Gohda‐san and Shannon‐chan had been killed,`
` not even the servants, who didn't bear the name Ushiromiya, would be spared...`
`"A‐...are we...`
`......all gonna be killed...?"`
`"...But that's weird, George nii‐san!`
` Why only six people, then?`
` They could have killed a lot more.`
` In the worst case, it might even have been possible for them to assault us all while we were sleeping and kill everyone in a single night.`
` Why didn't they do that?!"`
`"............The special clause.`
` ...If someone managed to solve the riddle of the gold, the right to the interest would be lost.`
` ......And remember how the very last part of the letter concluded?`
` ...It said for everyone to try to solve the riddle of Grandfather's gold."`
`"Jesus...!`
` ......It looks like we're finally getting close to understanding the culprit's message...`
` In other words, the culprit is telling us to try and solve the riddle on that epitaph Grandfather had made.`
` ......{i:Furthermore, they're saying that if we just sit around, they'll keep collecting the interest}..."`
`I realized that this was all based on several crazy guesses.`
`......But not everything that happens in this world is joined together in a perfect line.`
`...Most unknown phenomena are nothing but individual points.`
`{n}......By joining them together into lines, we deepen our understanding.`
`The closer together the points at the ends of those lines are, the more logical it is, and the easier to understand.`
`...And the farther away they are, the more it lacks those qualities.`
`{n}That is why we use a distance analogy, and call such theories "way out there".`
`{n}...However, if you can only join up to a small, limited distance away, we call it having a "limited imagination".`
`Is imagination different from reasoning?`
`{n}Was I just trying to force everything that I knew about the case to fit my simple imagination?`
`No, that's not it.`
`{n}When you're searching around with your hands in the dark, that search is imagination.`
`Only imagination can find the two points you should connect together.`
`{n}...Reasoning is nothing more than the action of drawing the line between them.`
`If you can't imagine, you can't reason.`
`{n}......What I was doing might be "out there"...but it shouldn't be wrong, either.`
`Only the power of imagination can pull out a clue from the darkness.`
`{n}......And the power of reasoning ties those clues together.`
`...It's a lot like the process of searching out an enemy's weak spot and striking.`
`It's alright if it's crazy.`
`{n}Find the weak point first.`
`{n}Then we can think about how to strike!`
`Now was the time to find the points that we could tie together later...!`
`For the time being, I put aside whether a 19th person exists,`
` and announced the theory that the goal of the culprit might have been to make us solve the riddle of the epitaph.`
`Uncle Hideyoshi looked like he was really interested, but Aunt Natsuhi thought it was ridiculous.`
`"Of course.`
` If you think about it that way, even that letter from yesterday makes sense.`
` That motive seems to fit pretty well with the facts...!`
` Settin' aside whoever it was that gave Maria‐chan the letter."`
`"Uu!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} exists!!`
` Uu."`
`Even though she was puffing up her cheeks in that cute way she had been doing since yesterday, ...I couldn't think of it as cute.`
`...If I took it lightly, it might suddenly transform into a creepy laugh...`
`"...The hidden gold doesn't exist.`
` However, the idea that we have a culprit who foolishly believes otherwise, wants Father's gold,`
` and whose motive is to make us solve the riddle and then steal the gold from us, does indeed make some sense."`
`"However, in that case, why did they kill those most highly ranked in the Ushiromiya family first?"`
`".........A good point.`
` If they wanted to make us solve the riddle, killing those closest to Kinzo‐san doesn't sound like a good plan to me."`
`"I agree...`
` Besides, if we follow that argument, wouldn't it have been quicker if they had threatened Father in the first place?`
` You'd think it would be faster to just ask the person who wrote it, rather than try to force us to solve it."`
`"That's also a good point.`
` ...'Course, I don't think that Father would let it slip from any ordinary threat."`
`"Anyone who knows Kinzo‐san well would surely be well aware that he won't bow to ordinary threats..."`
`"......He is the man who bears the burden of the Ushiromiya family and all its wealth.`
` He has been exposed to many threats and attacks in the past.`
` It is because he was able to overcome them that the family prospers today."`
`"Totally agreed on that.`
` I can't imagine our grandfather letting himself get pushed around just 'cause some asshole threatened him!"`
`"...Jessica, that is not how we talk."`
`"............u...`
`......yes."`
`"In that case, .........what about this one?`
` ......No wait, is this "out there" as well...?"`
`...I couldn't hesitate!`
` A crazy idea is like a bow and arrow.`
`...It might be hard to hit with, but it's a great weapon that can strike enemies from afar.`
`......Research shows that most people who have died in battles were killed by wounds from arrows.`
`......In a battle, you don't shoot off just one arrow.`
`You shoot off a whole bunch of arrows at once, and assault the enemy soldiers with a wall of them.`
`{n}......So shoot them, over and over!`
` "Assault the truth with a wall...!"`
`"If the culprit is after the hidden gold, it would be very inefficient for them to force us to solve the riddle.`
` Asking the person who made it in the first place would be much quicker and easier."`
`".........In that case, the question is,`
` ...is this all a message directed at Grandfather?"`
`In other words, these murders were a threat directed at Grandfather.`
`{n}......If he didn't tell the culprit where the gold was, his family members would be killed off one by one.`
`What if we weren't the only ones being forced to solve this riddle...`
` ...What if Grandfather was too?!`
`If you think about it that way, it explained Grandfather's mysterious disappearance.`
`If the culprit had attacked Grandfather, then judging by the state the six bodies were left in,`
` he would definitely have been displayed somewhere with that horrible makeup added.`
`But despite that, we still hadn't found him.`
` ......Did that mean that Grandfather had been kidnapped, and was being held somewhere?!`
`".........How could...`
` .........You aren't saying, how could......!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*.`
` That sounds interesting.`
` ...So Father is being confined somewhere,`
` and being threatened that if he doesn't tell them the location of the gold, we will be killed off one by one?"`
`"I struggle to understand what you find interesting about that...!"`
`Aunt Natsuhi threatened her, but Auntie Eva just smiled calmly.`
`"......Since we still haven't seen him after all this time, I think that it's almost certain that Grandfather has gotten caught up in the crime.`
` When you think about that, you can't just ignore Battler‐kun's theory, right...?"`
`"Stay quiet, George.`
` ......In the first place, when exactly was it that Father went missing?"`
`"...Who was the last one to see Father?"`
`".........It was probably me.`
` This morning, when we were worried that we didn't know where my husband and the rest were, we were talking about how they might be in Father's study,`
` and I went to check his room and greeted him."`
`".........Come to think of it, I've been holding the key to his study the whole time, haven't I.`
` Genji, let me return this to you."`
`Aunt Natsuhi pulled out the gold key and handed it to Genji‐san...`
`Looking at the key, Auntie Eva giggled...`
`"...Hey, Genji‐san.`
` I'm sure the police will inspect Father's room thoroughly anyway.`
` ...It doesn't matter what you hide, it will just be exposed anyway.`
` ......So you might as well just tell us about it right here, right now, don't you think?"`
`"............What are you talking about?"`
`"It's simple.`
` .........Don't forget, Father's study is a locked room, with no way in or out except for that key.`
` I want to double‐check how that's being defined.`
` There is one entrance to Father's study.`
` And also the windows?`
` Any other entrances or exits?"`
`"............There are none.`
` There is no way to get in except for the entrance."`
`"You're sure about that?`
` There isn't some secret hidden door or anything?`
` ......Since Father isn't here, I am the highest ranked member of the Ushiromiya family.`
` I am asking you as a representative of the Ushiromiya family head.`
` Understand that and answer me."`
`"Are there any ways in or out of that room other than the main entrance?`
` ......As Father's closest aide, I'm sure you know."`
`Aunt Natsuhi looked a little offended at the part about the "highest ranked family member",`
` but she kept her mouth closed for the time being, and waited for Genji's answer.`
`......I couldn't help but feel a little uncomfortable.`
`{n}Why was she going on and on about hidden doors...??`
`"You too, Kanon‐kun, Kumasawa‐san—if you know, won't you tell me?`
` If there is one, it would be better if you said it."`
`"...If there isn't, then someone is going to be very much driven into a corner in a second.`
` ......If I'm given that there is a hidden door, then my argument comes to nothing."`
`Auntie Eva didn't specify which person was about to be driven into a corner,`
` ...but following the flow of the conversation, I had to feel that she was referring to Aunt Natsuhi.`
`"......Mother, ...what are you talking about?"`
`"George, stay quiet for a while.`
` .........What do you say?`
` Genji‐san?`
` Kanon‐kun?`
` And Kumasawa‐san?`
` Is there a hidden door?`
` Or not?`
` Genji‐san, when you remodeled Father's study, you must have overseen the construction.`
` I won't let you say that you don't know."`
`"............There is nothing of that nature in the Master's study."`
`"You're sure?`
` What about Kanon‐kun, entrusted with the One‐winged Eagle?"`
`"......Yes.`
` I'm sure.`
` ......There is nothing like a hidden door in the Master's study."`
`"Kumasawa‐san?"`
`"N‐......no, I haven't heard of such a thing..."`
`"What about Doctor Nanjo, who had a close relationship with Father?"`
`"......I, I have never heard of something like that..."`
`"Great!`
` Then are you ready?`
` Let me begin.`
` It's really simple."`
`Everyone tilted their head doubtfully, wondering what Auntie Eva was so proudly starting to talk about.`
`...Auntie Eva laughed triumphantly, as though she were about to reveal a secret that only she knew.`
`"Natsuhi nee‐san was the last person to spot Father, right?`
` ...I forget the exact time, but I think it was a little before nine in the morning."`
`"......Nee‐san, do you remember?`
` I ran into you just as you were coming out of Father's study, right?"`
`"......Yes, I remember.`
` What does that have to do with anything?"`
`"And the next time you went to visit Father's study?`
` That was after we had found the bodies of Nii‐san and the rest, right?`
` Together with me, you went up to the study to report that, and we discovered that he wasn't there."`
`".........By the way, Nee‐san.`
` At that time, when you went to enter Father's study, did you notice anything?"`
`".........Notice anything?`
` ...What are you talking about?"`
`"Come on.`
` You picked up some trash, right?`
` A folded receipt."`
`"......I do seem to remember picking up some trash.`
` What does that have to do with...?"`
`"I got that receipt when I bought some candy at a store in the airport."`
`Auntie Eva pulled a small bag of candy out of her handbag.`
`"...Aah, the receipt from when you bought that candy?`
` ...But, Mother, what does that receipt have to do with anything...?"`
`"George, stay quiet and listen for just a little longer..."`
`Uncle Hideyoshi's expression was a little strict.`
`{n}...Somehow, it seemed that he understood what Auntie Eva was getting at.`
`"It was really just on a whim, you see?`
` It wasn't out of any foresight,`
` and I certainly wasn't planning on setting a trap for you or anything."`
`"......Actually, this receipt...`
` You remember, Nee‐san, that just after you met Father and left, you met me, right?`
` At that time, I stuck this into the door to the study."`
`"......So, what does that mean?`
` Does it mean that, until Aunt Natsuhi picked up that receipt, no one had opened the door...?"`
`"W‐wait a second, Auntie Eva...!`
` Sticking a receipt in would be obvious!`
` It's possible that, when Grandfather opened the door, he noticed it, found it interesting, and stuck it back in the door..."`
`Jessica hurriedly argued back.`
`...She still didn't really know what it meant,`
` but she realized that, whatever it was, it was placing some kind of suspicion on her own mother.`
`"Of course, I folded the receipt up very small so that no one would notice it.`
` But even if you assume that he saw it fall, he would have no way of knowing how high up the door it had been stuck, right?"`
`"I checked it while Natsuhi nee‐san was taking the key out.`
` The receipt was still stuck not one millimeter away from where I had put it...!"`
`"I, ......I can't understand why you would pull such a childish prank!`
` I, I'll bet you were the one who did that prank on the door to my room, too!"`
`"......The door to your room?"`
`"...It was unpleasant to talk about, so I didn't,`
` but this morning, when I woke up, there were the signs of some prank on the outside of my door, with what was probably the same red paint that was scribbled across the shutter.`
` There were some unpleasant marks, as though someone had been tearing at the door..."`
`"Wait, what is this!`
` Why have you been silent about this until now...?!!"`
`"My apologies.`
` Since so many horrid things have happened since then, I had completely forgotten about it until just now."`
`"I don't know or care about that.`
` I am not talking about your door, but the door to Father's room, okay?`
` After you checked that he was in his room, and until we made sure that he wasn't, that door wasn't opened even once.`
` How did Father get out if he didn't use the door?"`
`".........I, ...I don't know that...!`
` That's what I want to know!!!"`
`"Natsuhi nee‐san, other than you, who else checked to see whether Father was in his room?"`
`"The last time I met Kinzo‐san was when we were playing chess last night...`
` ...I believe I was with him until just before dinner......"`
`"Did anyone see him after that?"`
`"...............I did.`
` I gave him his dinner last night."`
`"......Yes.`
` Shannon and I were with him."`
`"So up till then, Father was still definitely in his room.`
` ...But, Natsuhi nee‐san.`
` It sounds like when you found out he wasn't there, all ways in or out of the study were closed, right?`
` ......But even so, you said that you met and talked with him this morning."`
`"......I, ......I don't understand why everyone has become so gloomy.`
` ...Could someone explain it to me...?"`
`"M‐......Mother and Father, are you...`
`......saying that what Aunt Natsuhi says about meeting Grandfather this morning...`
`...is a lie?"`
`"Wh‐why the hell would she tell a lie? Mom's innocent!!`
` Why the hell would she lie!!"`
`"Jessica!`
` I keep telling you to watch your language!"`
`All at once, everything became confused...`
`From across the parlor table, Auntie Eva and Aunt Natsuhi confronted each other,`
` while George‐aniki confronted Jessica...`
` ......What the hell is going on...?!!`
`"Remember, it's only up until last night that we have multiple people saying they saw him.`
` But the only one who claims that they saw Father since this morning is Natsuhi nee‐san."`
`"......And then there's that strange fact we learned from the receipt.`
` ...So, how can we connect these points together...?"`
`Auntie Eva urged everyone to work their imaginations...`
`......Sure, that receipt could become an important point.`
`{n}...But I didn't know what other point I could draw a line towards...!`
`The answer Auntie Eva was hoping for...`
`......was that Aunt Natsuhi had lied to make it seem as if Grandfather had been in that room this morning.`
`And Auntie Eva's mere whim had exposed that......??`
`"That makes no friggin' sense!!`
` Why the hell would Mom lie?!!`
` She has no friggin' reason to!!"`
`"......That's what I want to know."`
`"But Jessica‐chan.`
` You can't say that there's no possible reason for her to lie about Father being in the room, right?`
` You see it every once in a while in detective novels, don't you?`
` That trick of confusing the time of death to create an alibi."`
`"Wh‐what are you talking about?!`
` I've never even heard of that!!"`
`"...We still haven't found Father yet, but if you think about it normally, it would be natural to assume that he has already been killed.`
` In that case, we should expect to find his corpse soon."`
`"...If, at that point, the time of death could be faked, Natsuhi nee‐san would be able to create an alibi.`
` ......Do you understand?`
` Everyone?"`
`...This morning, when Aunt Natsuhi went to check that Grandfather was there, she lied,`
` ...and he was already dead at that time?`
`...And, she moved the body to some location, and disguised it to make it seem like he had just been killed there.`
`......And then she could stay with everyone else to prepare an alibi.`
`......And then, she could say "I heard someone screaming!"`
` or something and dash over there, and become the first to find the body along with everyone else... Is that what Auntie Eva's saying......?`
`"How preposterous.`
` Detective novels are nothing more than indulgent entertainment!`
` You can only think of such an indiscreet idea because you read them all the time!"`
`"Yeah!!`
` Even if she tried to fake the time of death a little, all of that would be blown away in an instant once the police did their autopsy!!`
` It might have fooled the people in old books, but do you seriously think that kind of trick would fly in modern Japan?!`
` Are you insane?!"`
`"......You think so?`
` This morning, when Doctor Nanjo looked at the corpses, he was only able to give a vague estimate of the time of death, right?`
` Autopsy results are affected greatly by the corpse's surroundings and individual peculiarities.`
` It's a very rough estimate with an uncertainty of several hours."`
`"And, unfortunately, the police's scientific investigation will have to wait until tomorrow.`
` Measuring the exact time of death after that, even in modern Japan like you said, wouldn't be that easy, you know?`
` Right, Doctor Nanjo...?"`
`"............Examining a corpse is an extremely difficult task that requires both experience and instinct...`
` I have heard that there is a very high rate of mistaken diagnoses...`
` I imagine it is very possible for a misreading of just a few hours to occur..."`
`"...However, for an alibi, that's more than enough!`
` It's not just a trick for the classics!`
` It's a trick that actually works!`
` ......Natsuhi nee‐san.`
` It's not like we want to suspect you, alright?`
` We don't, an' that's why we just want you to prove you're innocent."`
`"What is this innocence you want me to prove?!!`
` This morning, I definitely met with Father!!`
` And he told me to keep the One‐winged Eagle engraved in my heart...`
` ......Are you denying that he said that, too?!!"`
`"I will definitely not permit that!!`
` I won't permit you to deny that Father said those words!!"`
`"......Maybe Father's body won't appear at all?`
` Normally, a person has to be missing for seven years before they're officially declared dead.`
` Wouldn't that be a clever way to extend Father's nearly finished life another seven years and keep all of his wealth for yourself!"`
`"I, I cannot abide this!!`
` I cannot abide any more from you!!"`
`"I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi!!`
` Although I do not have the right to wear the One‐winged Eagle on my body, it is certainly engraved in my heart!!`
` Speaking that way to the wife of Krauss, successor to the head—to the person who will act as such in his place—absolutely disgusting!!!"`
`"What's thiiis?`
` Are you going to shoot me with that gun?`
` Go ahead, then?`
` Why don't you just shoot?!`
` You're just desperate because you can't think of a way out, aren't you?!`
` Do it, just try to obscure the truth with violence...!!"`
`"Y‐......youuu!!!!"`
`It wasn't like Aunt Natsuhi had been actually holding that gun at the ready and threatening anyone.`
`{n}But after she was told to by Auntie Eva, she did hold it at the ready!`
`...Unsurprisingly, once things got to this stage, Jessica and Genji‐san tried to stop her.`
`"...Madam, please, calm yourself......!"`
`"Mom, you aren't lying!`
` So there's no reason for you to listen to this!!"`
`"......Calm down, Natsuhi nee‐san.`
` Don't you just have to swear that Father was definitely in that room?`
` Why are you getting so worked up over that...?"`
`"...Th‐...that's right.`
` Natsuhi‐san isn't lying.`
` Isn't that the end of it...?"`
`"Then I want you to explain.`
` How did Father manage to disappear from the room?`
` ...The windows were closed tight from the inside.`
` And the door too, remember!"`
`"......If you really met with Father this morning,`
` ...then you must explain how he disappeared from this "unopened door" locked‐room scenario.`
` If you don't, that would mean that you are a liar after all, right?"`
`"How far do you plan to mock me......?!!!"`
`"If you want to argue back, go ahead!!`
` That's right, try explaining it right here, right now.`
` After that, I can apologize to you for doubting you.`
` How did Father manage to get out from that locked room?!!"`
`"I can't explain that, and I don't need to!!"`
`"Really?`
` Then let me explain it!`
` We'll take the best parts from my perspective and yours, and come up with a more friendly explanation!`
` ......I'll believe that, like you said, Father was still in his room this morning."`
`"But the next time the door was opened, Father wasn't there.`
` You don't have any objections so far, right?"`
`"I have no desire to listen to anything more you have to say!!`
` Shut your frivolous mouth!!"`
`"My reasoning goes like this, alright?`
` I verified on both occasions that you were the only one to go through that door.`
` And the receipt is proof of that!`
` So what is the answer to the puzzle of how Father was sent out of the room regardless?"`
`"The window!`
` He was sent out the window.`
` ......Natsuhi nee‐san, you pushed Father out of the third‐story window of the study into the courtyard!!!"`
`"YOU....VICIOUS MALCONTENT!!!!!!!!!!!!"`
`"Madam, please, endure it...!!"`
`"Eva‐sama... Please stop this.....!!"`
`"Father died from the fall into the courtyard,`
` and when you left saying you were going to check the doors and windows, you went and hid the corpse somewhere!`
` That was probably when you took some measures to fake the time of death, right?!"`
`"......This all ties in with the case regardin' Krauss nii‐san and the rest, and also the case regardin' {f:5:Beatrice} last night!`
` There's an extremely good chance that Natsuhi‐san is suspicious in those cases...`
` Normally, I wouldn't want to say this."`
`"...But now it's out in the open, there's nothin' else I can do...!`
` Please, Natsuhi nee‐san!`
` Please explain how you can be innocent!!`
` Or else, I can't help but suspect you...!!"`
`"Why me?!!`
` Why must I, Ushiromiya Natsuhi, be insulted like this!!!!!!!!"`
`...............Hmm.`
` ...Looks like everyone else has said their piece.`
`"Ihihihi.`
` ...No good. {i:No goddamn good at all},`
` Auntie Eva."`
`"...Wh‐...what do you mean "no good", Battler..."`
`Jessica looked up at me, hanging on to my every word.`
`{n}Auntie Eva's expression was composed as always.`
`"......No good at all, you say? What is?`
` Battler‐kun.`
` Tell me."`
`"You can only see this from one angle—that's why you're convinced that it has to be Aunt Natsuhi.`
` ...It's not like I'm defending her, but bluffing a checkmate like that isn't gonna work."`
`"I think the theory you've based around that receipt is passable.`
` It's not a bad thread of logic.`
` But I'd only give it a grade of 65 at best.`
` If this were an exam, that'd be bad enough to get you extra lessons in detention, you know?`
` Ihihi!"`
`"...Oh my. Well, how would you break through a door sealed by a receipt, and make Father disappear? Other than by my theory?!"`
`"Your theory is interesting, I admit.`
` And if we could state definitively that there was no way to make Grandfather disappear other than yours,`
` then we could say for certain that the last person to see him, Aunt Natsuhi, has to be responsible."`
`"However, since there still is a possibility that she is innocent, and that these accusations are false, you can't make that claim!!"`
`"......Hmm. Then, Battler‐kun, who are you saying could have made Grandfather disappear, other than Natsuhi nee‐san?`
` It would be impossible for anyone else to do it.`
` My receipt proved that, right?"`
`"From the first time she visited that study,`
` and until the second time when we visited it together, the study was a perfect locked room, and when the seal was broken on the locked room, he was already missing!`
` If this doesn't prove that she was the culprit, what kind of trick could they have used?!"`
`"Like I said, Auntie Eva, only 65 points.`
` So, let's try "flipping over the chessboard", shall we?`
` It's not about how they managed to make Grandfather disappear from the outside.`
` Think about how Grandfather disappeared from the inside."`
`"The door had the receipt stuck in it, so it couldn't have been used.`
` He also couldn't have gone through a window, because they can't be locked from the outside, and when you visited the study, you checked to make sure they were locked.`
` So the windows also weren't used.`
` At that point, the study really was a locked room.`
` We have to accept this!"`
`"However, the study didn't remain a locked room forever.`
` Once the seal created by the receipt was removed, it became possible to use the door, and possible to escape through the door."`
`"...In other words, it's not about how Aunt Natsuhi made Grandfather disappear.`
` ...We need to think about how he was able to escape!!"`
`"Grandfather's study isn't any ordinary study, right?`
` According to Genji‐san, there's a toilet and a kitchen and even a bedroom, almost like a little house.`
` ......If he hid under the bed, for example, he could trick the two of you into thinking he'd disappeared, right?"`
`"Auntie Eva, even you didn't check that carefully, did you?`
` And then the two of you went back down the stairs, thinking that he wasn't there."`
`"At that time, the receipt was already gone!`
` In other words, if Grandfather was hiding in his room the whole time when it was a locked room,`
` and escaped after letting the two of you go past him, we can crack this locked room right open!!"`
`"Wh‐what is this?!`
` Why would Father want to do something that weird and then escape the room?!`
` Don't be so absurd!"`
`"Yeah, it might be absurd.`
` However, it still shows that there is a possibility that Aunt Natsuhi is being accused falsely.`
` Your receipt wasn't perfect.`
` In chess, we might call that check,`
` but it isn't checkmate!!"`
`"And the thing that I like least,`
` is how you pressure Aunt Natsuhi to explain it, and then argue that if she doesn't, she must be guilty!`
` If that passes as logic, then why don't you let me......"`
`"...flip over the chessboard one more time!!"`
`"Auntie Eva, according to your argument,`
` ......you must explain to us here and now why you and Uncle Hideyoshi couldn't have killed those six last night and then casually returned to the guesthouse...!"`
`"You've been trying to force Aunt Natsuhi to explain.`
` I'm sure you can prove your own innocence, right?!`
` Auntie Eva, who's had all of Grandfather's wealth suddenly dropped right into her hands!!"`
`"Th‐that's right, you're pretty damn suspicious yourself, aren't you!!`
` If you say Mom's suspicious 'cause she was the last person to see him,`
` then what about you, Auntie Eva, who was the last person to see Dad and the rest?!!`
` Just like Battler said, prove that you two weren't the ones that killed them!!"`
`".........Mother, I also think that your reasoning was a little overeager.`
` ......I'm sure that the receipt was an important hint."`
`"But, like Battler‐kun said, that's not enough to prove that Aunt Natsuhi is guilty to any degree.`
` ......We're all equally suspicious.`
` It's not right for only Aunt Natsuhi to be persecuted."`
`"Our, our noble father, crawling on the floor under his bed?`
` You call nonsense like that an explanation?!"`
`"Then why don't you explain first?!!`
` Who killed those six, and how, and then try showing us proof that you weren't involved!!"`
`"......*cough*,`
` *cough* *cough* *cough*,`
` *cough*,`
` *kof*!!!`
` uu, *cough* *cough* *cough*!!`
` *coughCOUGH*!!`
` *kofkofkofkof*!!!"`
`"Milady... Milady...!!"`
`Jessica suddenly started coughing.`
` At first I thought that she was just choking after yelling too loud, but it seemed to be lasting too long for that, and she really looked like she was suffering...`
`Jessica kept coughing and choking, down on her hands and knees...`
`"Jessica... Hang in there...!!`
` Doctor Nanjo...!"`
`"...Jessica‐san, your inhaler, quickly.`
` ......No, wait, I have one with me."`
`Doctor Nanjo pulled a bronchodilator inhaler from his own bag, which was lying on the sofa, and handed it to Kanon‐kun.`
`......Come to think of it, six years ago, didn't Jessica sometimes break into violent coughing and have to use that...?`
`But six years ago, I never saw Jessica look like she was in this much pain.`
`"......Aniki, was Jessica's asthma always this bad...?"`
`"It's gotten a lot worse these last few years...`
` It's no problem when she's normal...`
` But when an attack comes suddenly, she can't stop coughing."`
`"*cough* *cough*!!`
` uu, ga*COUGH* *coughcough*!!`
` *kofkof*, *kofkof*!!"`
`"......Milady, your medicine.`
` .........Here..."`
`"...............nnn...`
`...`
` ......*coughcough*!!"`
`Taking the inhaler from Kanon‐kun, Jessica used it with a practiced hand.`
`...For a while, it looked like her throat was still feeling itchy, but it gradually settled down...`
`"Are you alright, Jessica...?`
` You scared me..."`
`"......It's no big deal.`
` ...Don't worry about it..."`
`Beads of sweat covered Jessica's whole body and she couldn't hide her rough breathing, but it looked like her sudden attack had calmed down for now...`
`This disturbance had left the room's hostile atmosphere in an awkward, unsettled state.`
`But that was fine.`
` ......There was absolutely no need to be driving up everyone's suspicions of each other.`
`When you think about it, even probing at each other's alibis and searching for the killer were probably completely unnecessary.`
`After all, we're just powerless, ordinary people,`
` and when the police come tomorrow, they'll definitely employ cutting‐edge techniques and investigate the case thoroughly,`
` solve all of the riddles and arrest the killer...`
`"............I wonder if Battler‐kun is right after all.`
` ...Just like Natsuhi nee‐san is suspicious, I can't ignore the fact that we are suspicious too.`
` Arguing about that now is certainly unproductive.`
` ...Everything will be fine if we just leave it to the police tomorrow."`
`".........But don't you want to know too, Battler‐kun?`
` Who the killer is?`
` ...Don't you want to let them know right this very second the pain you feel from losing someone precious to you?"`
`".........I won't deny that.`
` Even one day would be too long to let the bastard who pulled this detestable bullshit go."`
`"......But that doesn't mean that I want to doubt one of the 18.`
` Even though I said what I said earlier, I don't even want to doubt you, Auntie Eva.`
` ...To me, you're an awesome aunt who's always mischievous and entertaining."`
`"......I don't want to trade insults with an aunt like that.`
` Not a single person here wants to do that.`
` .........Right?`
` Everyone?"`
`"..................I feel the same as Battler‐kun.`
` ...It's pointless to trade insults.`
` ......It's probably just the stress built up because so many people have been crammed in one place since morning."`
`"......Probably.`
` It is only natural...`
` It may be easier said than done, but I think we should all relax as much as possible..."`
`"...............Eva.`
` Don't you think we should cool our heads?`
` ...I do think the receipt is gonna be an important clue in searchin' for Father's whereabouts.`
` We should tell the police about it when they come..."`
`"...Yes, you're right.`
` ...Yes.`
` I just felt a little triumphant when I figured out that part with the receipt.`
` ......Of course it isn't fair to only doubt Natsuhi nee‐san.`
` We're just as suspicious."`
`"......But still, Battler‐kun?`
` At least the part about the receipt is real, alright?`
` ...Don't forget this.`
` And try thinking deeply about what this means, okay...?"`
`"....................."`
`"...................................."`
`Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi stood up.`
`{n}It looked like they planned on leaving the parlor.`
`"In the end, it's pointless for us to continue playing detectives.`
` After all, the police will reveal everything in the end anyway."`
`.........That's right.`
`Even if we don't play this detective game, when the typhoon passes,`
` ...and those lively seagulls return to the harbor, everything will settle itself.`
`Yes.`
` If you think about it, this kind of crime is completely trivial.`
`......It will definitely be resolved—`
`even if we do nothing—`
`{i:when the seagulls cry}.`
`"...Natsuhi nee‐san, I'll take it that you don't want to see my face anymore?`
` I feel the same.`
` ...If I remember correctly, yesterday, you had some rooms prepared for us in the mansion so that we wouldn't need to go back to the guesthouse, right?"`
`"There should be a bath and a toilet there, as well as a lock and a chain to secure the door.`
` There's even a bed to lie on, and my husband will be able to watch TV without having to fight with Maria‐chan over which channel to watch, okay?"`
`"....................................`
` ......You may do as you please.`
` ...But...make sure to be cautious."`
`"Thank you, Nee‐san.`
` ...And mind your own business.`
` I'll be counting on you to keep an eye on everyone, alright?`
` Because the killer is definitely among us.`
` ...And Nee‐san, make sure you don't forget that you're being watched, too."`
`".........Haven't you made enough parting remarks?"`
`"...Yes, that's enough.`
` .........See you, Natsuhi nee‐san.`
` ......Genji‐san, please call for us when it's dinnertime.`
` Until then, we'll keep ourselves locked in with the chain."`
`"..........................."`
`"......Genji, Kanon.`
` Escort them to the guest room."`
`"We'll be fine.`
` I don't want to end up being escorted by the killer.`
` In fact, I would be more comfortable if nobody left this room until we reach ours.`
` .........Let's go, George."`
`"...............I'll stay here with everyone else."`
`"George...!`
` The killer is in this room.`
` Do you plan on staying in a place like that...?!"`
`"......Leaving this room...would be the same as suspecting one of my relatives.`
` ...I......refuse to believe that anyone in our family is capable of something so horrifying."`
`"George...!`
` ......Honey, say something to him...!"`
`".........George is already an adult.`
` ...If his code tells him not to leave this room, then it's up to him.`
` Let him do what he wants..."`
`"...Father..."`
`Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi left.`
`{n}The only voice that called after them was the sound of the rain.`
`The parlor was being buried beneath the savage atmosphere...`
`{n}When I looked at the clock, I was surprised to find that it was already evening.`
`.........Had we really spent that much time worrying, talking, fighting about such needless things...?`
`Feeling bored, I started clawing at my head, when...`
`...Maria and I made eye contact.`
`Since I had thought she was completely immersed in the TV, I was a little surprised.`
`"......I'll believe it now."`
`"Uu...?"`
`"The letter, the murders, everything—it was all {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...No, actually, I wish she would just come out and say that was true.`
` .........I want it to be the work of a 19th person.`
` Otherwise, the 18 of us will have to keep on doubting each other...`
` ...I think believing in a 19th person is better than that..."`
`".............................."`
`"...Bringing Grandfather outside without opening the doors or windows must be a piece of cake for {f:5:Beatrice}, right...?"`
`Maria, after taking a single, short breath, hung her head, ......and then raised her face again.`
`"............That's right.`
` Kihihihihihihihi, locking a door is useless against a witch.`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice} is familiar with all 72 demons.`
` The 33rd ranked, Gaap, gives the power to instantly carry the desired person to any location."`
`"...To her, taking a person out of any locked room isn't hard at all, you see?`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi..."`
`"Witches sure are incredible.`
` ......Tell her, if she still plans on committing another crime, to do it in a way that no human could,`
` ......to make me believe that a 19th person,`
` ......no, a witch, exists."`
`".................................Kihihi.`
` ......Alright.`
` If I meet her, I'll tell her."`
`Dammit...`
` I don't even understand my own thoughts anymore...`
`When I'm led to believe in a 19th person, I deny it, and when I'm led to believe that there are only 18 people, I deny that too.`
`Even though I wish that there were more than just the 18 people here, I can't accept the existence of that 19th person.`
`......In short, even though there are more than 18 people, there are less than 19.`
`{n}......The number of people in this mansion is 19>X>18.`
`{n}So the number of people can't be represented by an integer.`
`......However, it's impossible for there to be anything after the decimal point.`
`{n}You shouldn't be able to represent the number of people with anything but an integer.`
`...And yet, 19>X>18.`
`{n}Why does a fraction less than 1 play into this...!`
`It's no wonder.`
` ...That 19th person is an {i:invisible being, that can't be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}}.`
`{n}That's why, in the integer representation that must be used to describe numbers of people, she {i:can't be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}}.`
`That witch cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}.`
`{n}Because {f:5:Beatrice} has no body.`
`{n}Therefore, she is invisible.`
`Is there a 19th person, or not?`
`{n}Does the witch exist, or not?`
`19>X>18.`
`{n}...The witch exists somewhere in that X...!`
`The uncomfortable atmosphere continued even after those two left.`
`It was thick with the idea that thinking about who the killer was would be the same as deciding who to doubt.`
` ...It had begun to feel like discussion of the incidents was itself taboo.`
`So no one was mentioning it, at least out loud.`
`......However, those thoughts were what filled our minds.`
`{n}All that we couldn't say aloud made our heads feel like they were going to explode...`
`So, at least on the outside, the parlor had once again regained its calm mood.`
`Though everything was left unsettled.`
`"......It feels like the rain's gotten a little lighter."`
`"Uu...?`
` Still pouring down.`
` Uu..."`
`"Even if it did stop, there's no boat on this island.`
` ...But it'd be nice if the boat came quickly tomorrow.`
` I've had enough of this Western mansion vacation, ihihi."`
`"Mom, when will the boat come tomorrow?"`
`"Originally, the boat to take them back would have arrived at three o'clock today.`
` They probably would have telephoned to say that they would come after the typhoon passed, but unfortunately, the telephones aren't working..."`
`"......But they aren't children over there.`
` They were told this was for the purpose of dropping off and collecting our guests,`
` so they will most likely arrive first thing tomorrow morning—`
`probably around nine o'clock, I believe."`
`It was completely black outside.`
`{n}When I looked at the clock, I realized that it was just past seven.`
`{n}I was starting to get hungry...`
`In the kitchen, Kumasawa was cooking enthusiastically.`
`{n}She had laid out a variety of dishes, and while they didn't match the level of Gohda's artful cooking, they were still quite gorgeous.`
`It was an act of kindness from Kumasawa, trying to use food to enliven everyone's low spirits.`
`Kumasawa wasn't nearly as talented as a professional cook like Gohda, but she was far from unskilled.`
`...On the contrary, since she had been brought up in a fishing village, the simple food she created was sometimes very highly valued.`
`Kanon arranged the food Kumasawa had finished creating on plates, under her direction.`
`Kanon also helped in the kitchen sometimes, but since he was rarely placed in that role, he was slightly awkward, even though he tried his best...`
`Self‐conscious about the fact that he couldn't skillfully arrange the food, Kanon's expression darkened slightly.`
`But Kumasawa smiled to say everything was fine.`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, it's arranged beautifully.`
` Kanon‐kun, aren't you skilled."`
`"...............If it had been Shannon nee‐san,`
` ...it would be even more beautiful..."`
`Kanon stopped arranging the food for a bit, and hung his head...`
`Shannon was the one who always assisted Kumasawa in her cooking.`
`{n}...Tonight, Kanon was doing it instead.`
`......And as he remembered Shannon's face, and her brutal end, he grimaced...`
`"............Forget it for now..."`
`Genji spoke kindly to Kanon as he advanced a pawn.`
`...Nanjo had escaped from the parlor once the mood had become sour, and Genji had become his opponent in a game of chess upon Nanjo's request.`
`".........Yes.`
` ......I will forget it for now."`
`"...Good.`
` That is probably for the best."`
`Genji purposefully faced away from Kanon as he spoke.`
`...He did so because he understood that it might make things tougher on Kanon if he noticed that someone was looking at his eyes.`
`Nanjo also understood that, and held back any thoughtless words.`
`"......I wonder where Kinzo‐san has gone...`
` ......I hope that he is safe, but..."`
`".........I do not know.`
` ...Only, I think everything is as the Master hoped—as he has arranged.`
` ......To distrust that would exceed my role as furniture working for the Master."`
`"...Aren't you scared, Genji‐san...?`
` I am frightened something bad will occur again tonight..."`
`"............I have nothing to be afraid of.`
` ...I simply work for the Ushiromiya family."`
`Nanjo sighed through his nose, and made a carefully considered move.`
`...Nanjo was very slightly dubious.`
` ......Could Genji possibly think that he would be left out of this?`
`He couldn't begin to imagine what was happening inside this mansion.`
`...But he definitely couldn't deny the possibility that it was something of Kinzo's design.`
`...If you liken this island to chess, Kinzo had opened the game, and as a result, six pieces had fallen.`
`......Could it be that Genji was calm because he believed that he alone was outside the chessboard, and safe?`
`Nanjo thought about it.`
` ......Wasn't everyone just a piece on this chessboard, lined up equally, without any exceptions?`
`......Wasn't even Genji, who had gained more of Kinzo's trust than anyone,`
` ...no, wasn't Nanjo himself, although proud of his position as Kinzo's only close friend,`
` ...just another one of the pieces laid out on the chessboard?`
`".........Genji‐san.`
` ...I am really frightened about tonight.`
` ......I'm hoping with all my heart that we will be still be safe when tomorrow morning comes..."`
`The guest room that Eva and Hideyoshi had moved into was used to house guests before the guesthouse had been constructed.`
`So until a few years ago, they had stayed in this room every family conference and were very familiar with it.`
`This room, just like a room at a hotel, had a bedroom and a bathroom,`
` so even though they were still shut in, it was far more comfortable than the parlor.`
`"Guess it's true you can relax more when you're alone with your immediate family.`
` ......They should all just do this, shut themselves in guest rooms and lock the doors."`
`"But Natsuhi nee‐san's throwing her weight around, saying no one can leave the parlor.`
` How can any of them talk back?"`
`"She always felt she was being left out in the cold, so now that Nii‐san's dead, she's in high spirits, thinking her time has finally come.`
` ...Seriously, how shameless can she be."`
`"...Come now, don't say that.`
` Natsuhi‐san's workin' pretty hard.`
` No need to jump on her like that.`
` .........And about that receipt earlier, you went too far there."`
`"......Aww, come on.`
` If I hadn't said it there, there wouldn't be another good time to say it..."`
`Eva, sulking cutely, sat down beside Hideyoshi, who was lying on the bed watching TV.`
`"Still, ............it's been a very long time since we've been alone like this."`
`"Sure has.`
` When I think about it, both you and I have gotten older.`
` Since George was born, everything's gone by in the blink of an eye."`
`"...It really has gone by in the blink of an eye.`
` ......I wonder if we were too hasty in having a child."`
`Eva's eyes looked like they were staring off into the distance.`
`{n}......Yes, she had thought it a once‐in‐a‐lifetime chance.`
`...Her older brother Krauss had been unable to have a child for quite some time.`
`{n}Six years passed after his marriage to Natsuhi without any signs of pregnancy, which didn't please Kinzo at all.`
`As for Eva herself, she would be removed from the Ushiromiya register anyway once she got married, so whether a successor to the head was born or not, it was all the same to her.`
` ...So she had thought.`
`But then, one day,`
` ......she had a heavenly revelation.`
`{n}......Or maybe it was the whisperings of the devil that she had heard in her greed.`
`Perhaps she could remain in the Ushiromiya register if she gave birth to a successor first?`
`...If things went well, perhaps she could even inherit the Ushiromiya family herself...?`
`When she proposed this to Hideyoshi, he approved of it instantly.`
`{n}......This had not been because Hideyoshi also had greedy thoughts.`
`...For Hideyoshi, who had no close relatives,`
` it was a chance for him to feel once more that long‐forgotten thing called family.`
`So he agreed, without hesitation, not to fuss over which family name they were to keep upon getting married, and assented to having his name entered into the Ushiromiya family register.`
`It wasn't easy to persuade Kinzo, but as his daughter, Eva knew Kinzo's personality well.`
`......So, she chose the time when Kinzo was most dissatisfied with Natsuhi,`
` and expertly managed to make him accept Hideyoshi as a son‐in‐law.`
`......Looking at Hideyoshi, who had achieved success after starting from nothing, Kinzo might have seen a little bit of himself.`
`He quickly grew to like Hideyoshi, and permitted him to transfer into the Ushiromiya register...`
`George would eventually become the successor to the Ushiromiya family.`
`{n}They had raised him strictly with that purpose in mind.`
`George had been worth their while, and had grown into a fabulous young man who wouldn't disappoint no matter where he went.`
`...That was why she couldn't stand that he was in love with a servant like Shannon.`
`......So when she had learned that Shannon had died and the engagement had been invalidated,`
` ......while part of her had been shocked at the gruesome crime,`
` another part of her had been relieved that her precious George wouldn't be stolen by some servant girl...`
`"..................`
` .........I...`
`......always did hate Krauss nii‐san.`
` He was so full of himself, always swaggering around.`
` So proud that he would one day become the head."`
`"......So I wanted to get back at him.`
` ...Those were just my emotions as a child, of course...?`
` But in the end, those emotions......took over my entire life.`
` And if only that had been all!`
` ......Because of those emotions, I got you and George involved, and I used you."`
`"............Eva, don't blame yourself so much."`
`Hideyoshi sat up and put his arm around Eva.`
`{n}......She could feel a warm understanding from him.`
`"...Well, I reached the halfway point in my life long ago.`
` ...But you know, I have never once regretted how I've lived my life.`
` Not once."`
`".........I think that since I've been with you, Eva, I've been able to relish an enjoyable life that other men never will.`
` ......After I lost my relatives in the war, you taught me once more what the warmth of family is.`
` So I'm grateful for the Ushiromiya family, and think of it as my only family."`
`".........In this life I've led with you, not a single thing has been wasted.`
` It's really been a fun life up to today."`
`"......Thank you,`
` ......honey."`
`Eva hung her head, burying her face in Hideyoshi's chest...`
`{n}......Probably, no one in the parlor could even imagine that this side of Eva existed.`
`"I'm the one who should be thankin' you.`
` To this day, there hasn't been a single day that I've regretted being with you!"`
`"...............Me too.`
` I'm so glad...to have you by my side."`
`"George is already a fine adult.`
` He's a man who can do his job well on his own, even if I'm not there lookin' out for him.`
` ......How about it?`
` Around New Year's, do you wanna go spend some time in the Maldives?`
` Just us two, no one else."`
`"......No wayyy.`
` Aren't you always saying that you're so busy responding to New Year's cards that you don't even sleep...?"`
`"None of that this New Year's!`
` I won't read New Year's cards.`
` I'll just stay quiet and check to see if I've won the New Year's lottery.`
` It'd sure be nice if we won a color TV this year!"`
`"No wayyyy...`
` I don't wanna check the lottery in the Maldiiives..."`
`"Then none of that either!`
` ......Just the two of us, takin' our time, carryin' on from when we were newlyweds, just before George was born."`
`".........Yeah.`
` ...That does sound nice..."`
`"I hear the Maldives are wonderful.`
` An island with nothin' on it, surrounded by beaut'ful coral reefs and cottages lined up over the water..."`
`"......Carrying on from when we were newlyweds... When will that be...?"`
`"Soon as I've finished some business.`
` I won't know until I ask the travel agency, but probably before New Year's Eve—"`
`"No way.`
` .........Right now,`
` ...I want to start right now."`
`Peevishly, or maybe coquettishly, Eva pled for his lips...`
`The only sounds that filled the room were the distant voice of the announcer on the news, which Hideyoshi had left on, and the obnoxious pounding of the rain against the window...`
`There was a knock on the door, and Genji‐san entered.`
`".........Madam.`
` Dinner has been prepared.`
` Will you eat in here again...?"`
`"...Yes.`
` Bring it here.`
` Is Doctor Nanjo still in the kitchen?"`
`"............Yes.`
` He has said that he wishes to carefully deliberate over his next move.`
` ...Do not worry, he is with the other servants."`
`"Genji‐san's good enough at chess to be Grandfather's opponent.`
` I hear he's even better than Doctor Nanjo, you know?"`
`"...Is that right.`
` I played against him long ago, but he must have let me win."`
`"Maria, sounds like it'll be time to eat soon.`
` But look at you, you've been watching TV all day long and you still haven't gotten bored!"`
`"Uu.`
` I'm always watching TV so I'm fine.`
` Uu."`
`"Heh, Maria‐chan sure is a TV kid."`
`"Food's coming, so we have to clean up the table."`
`It was still cluttered with the aftermath of the drawing contest we had all been having, using several pages torn out of Maria's notebook.`
`Jessica began cleaning that up quickly.`
`{n}......Still, everyone here sure can draw.`
` Really shocking.`
`"......Genji.`
` Ask Eva‐san and Hideyoshi‐san whether they would at least like to have dinner with us.`
` ......Although they will probably turn us down."`
`"...Certainly."`
`"First Father, now Eva‐san...`
` We seem incapable of managing a full showing at the Ushiromiya dinner table."`
`Natsuhi felt her headache start throbbing again, and lightly held her temples...`
`The distance from the kitchen to the parlor wasn't that large, so Genji had gone there and back by himself, but the guest room was a little farther away.`
`Natsuhi had warned him not to be alone without good reason,`
` and just now, Nanjo had also admonished him, saying that it would be better if he held a little more concern for his safety.`
`...Genji took Kanon with him, and the two of them went to visit Eva and Hideyoshi in their guest room.`
`Genji knocked on the door.`
`"......Eva‐sama, Hideyoshi‐sama.`
` Dinner has been prepared."`
`He waited a short while for them to come out, but there was no response.`
`"............Genji‐sama, ......look at this."`
`Kanon pointed under the door.`
`......A Western‐style envelope had been inserted under it.`
`Normally, when something was inserted this way, it would be interpreted as a message from someone outside to someone in the room.`
`...So, since this might be a private note meant for Eva and Hideyoshi, it was not something that Kanon and Genji were supposed to take interest in.`
`...But this Western‐style envelope...`
`...was Kinzo's envelope, the same as the one Maria had taken out last night and surprised everyone with.`
`".....................`
` ...There's no mistake.`
` It's the Master's envelope."`
`"......Or...`
`........."`
`Although it had been Kinzo's envelope, ......the author of the letter Maria had read aloud last night had not been Kinzo......`
`Genji continued knocking a little harder and called out in a loud voice.`
`"Eva‐sama.`
` Eva‐sama...!`
` It is Genji.`
` Are you there?!`
` Please answer, Eva‐sama...!!"`
`But there was no response from inside.`
`Sometimes, when the servants went to call some guests for a meal, the guests would be sleeping so deeply that they wouldn't wake up.`
`...In times like that, the servants would stick a letter in the door to show that they had called by, and then leave the guest be.`
`......However, despite that, Genji beat even harder on the door and called out Eva's name.`
`But there was no answer.`
`Kanon stuck his ear up to the door, and holding his breath, listened for any sounds coming from inside...`
`"............I hear something that sounds like the television.`
` ...But I don't sense anyone.`
` ...The room might be empty..."`
`Genji took out a handkerchief, and, careful not to touch it with his bare hands,`
` gently pulled out the envelope which had been stuck under the door...`
`It had been sealed with deep red sealing wax.`
`{n}...Without a doubt, the mark on that sealing wax had come from the Ushiromiya Family Head's Ring...`
`"Eva‐sama!`
` Eva‐sama!!`
` Please answer!!`
` Are you still in your room?!"`
`Even so, there was still no answer...`
`There was a chance that the two were aimlessly walking around the mansion.`
`...This was the home Eva had grown up in.`
`{n}There was plenty of reason to think that she had gone out on a casual stroll...`
`Genji groped around in his pocket, and pulled out a bundle of keys including the one that would open the guest room.`
`"......Genji‐sama...?!"`
`Kanon also understood what this meant.`
`......They would sometimes unlock a guest's door so they could go in and do things like make the beds, but only after they had made sure the guest was out.`
`To unlock the door for a separate reason, and especially to do so when there was a chance the guests were still in there and without their permission, was an action unbecoming of a servant.`
`...However, Genji had decided.`
` .........If the only problem had been that his knock hadn't received a reply, he wouldn't have gone this far.`
`But the envelope under the door was doubtlessly Kinzo's.`
`{n}......Or rather, one of the Western‐style envelopes of the Ushiromiya family head.`
`...And after last night, the sender of this envelope could be someone other than Kinzo.`
`......If this letter had been sent by someone other than Kinzo.........`
`"Eva‐sama...!`
` My apologies.`
` Allow me to enter your room..."`
`After giving that final notice, Genji stuck one of the keys from the bundle into the keyhole.`
`There was the sound of the door unlocking.`
` ......And then, he slowly turned the knob, and slowly started opening the door.`
`Light seeped through the crack of the door.`
`{n}......Were they in the room?`
` Or had they......forgotten to turn out the lights...?`
`Clank.`
`...It was the sound of the door chain being pulled tight.`
`{n}The chain had been secured.`
`The chain couldn't be secured from the outside.`
`{n}That meant that they were in the room now.`
`The sound of voices on the TV seeped out of the room.`
`{n}...The lights, the chain, and the TV.`
`{n}All of these things made it clear that they were in the room,`
` .........but there was no sign of them.`
`Genji called to Eva once again through the crack of the door.`
`{n}But there was no answer.`
`".....................Genji‐sama...`
` ............What should we do...?"`
`As part of their job, the servants were able to unlock almost any lock in the mansion.`
`But they had no way to open a door with a chain.`
`......The only way to get by the chain was to cut it.`
`{n}...That was certainly not permitted as part of a servant's usual work.`
`......A creepy chill was already rushing up their backs...`
`Kanon held his breath again and tried to sense someone through the door, but even so, he was not able to sense anyone.`
`"...............I'll go call Madam.`
` ...Kanon, cut the chain."`
`"Y‐......yes...!"`
`As Kanon rushed away hurriedly to get a cutting tool, he was called back by Genji.`
`"Wait, Kanon...!`
` .........Go back to the kitchen and take Kumasawa with you.`
` Whatever you do, do not act alone."`
`"......Yes...`
` Certainly..."`
`It looked like Kanon was wondering why he had to do something so troublesome in the middle of this urgent situation.`
`......But Genji had said it out of wariness.`
`...He didn't care what happened to himself.`
`{n}......But in the worst case scenario, he didn't want anything to happen to Kanon.`
`In the kitchen was Kumasawa, who was piling food on the serving cart,`
` and Nanjo, who seemed to have thought of a move that would turn the tables on Genji, and had been awaiting his return, wanting to show him.`
`...But he immediately realized that something was wrong with Genji's demeanor.`
`"......Oh, ......what has happened, Genji‐san..."`
`".........Doctor Nanjo, my apologies, but please allow me to suspend this match for a time.`
` .........Kanon, take care of the chain.`
` Kumasawa, stop setting up dinner for now and accompany Kanon.`
` I will go over to Madam.`
` If you would come with me, Doctor Nanjo."`
`"Ha‐...has something happened......?"`
`Genji took Nanjo, who still didn't know what was going on, and quickly left the kitchen.`
`"...Kumasawa‐san.`
` My apologies, but please come with me."`
`"Wh‐...what happened, Kanon‐san......?"`
`Unable to take in the situation, Kumasawa said almost exactly the same thing as Nanjo, and chased after Kanon, who had flown out into the hallway...`
`Accompanied by Kumasawa, Kanon went to the storehouse,`
` and from amongst the tools packed in toolboxes and hanging on the walls, he looked for a tool that could be used to cut the chain.`
`"What are you looking for...?`
` ...I will help......"`
`"......We're cutting a door chain.`
` ...Where was that large bolt cutter..."`
`"A door chain...?`
` Wh‐why would you do something like that...?"`
`"............The chain is locked to Eva‐sama and Hideyoshi‐sama's room.`
` ...Even though they should be inside, when we called to them, they didn't answer."`
`It took Kumasawa some time to figure out how cutting the chain and Eva and Hideyoshi not answering were connected, but she did realize that this was an urgent situation.`
`"This will probably..."`
`Kanon took down a very large bolt cutter that had been hanging on the wall.`
`{n}It was called a cutter, but maybe it would be easier to understand if described as having the shape of a large pair of pliers.`
`......He recalled being warned that it was a dangerous tool that could easily cut through one of your fingers...`
`Kanon took that and rushed up the stairs.`
`{n}.........He knew it instinctively.`
` ...He should fight for every minute, every second to open it quickly.`
`{n}............Or maybe,`
` ......already............`
`"Please wait, Kanon‐san......!`
` Haah, ...haah...!"`
`"......Hurry!"`
`Kumasawa eventually caught up with him, gasping for breath with both hands on her knees.`
`When Kanon changed his grip on the bolt cutter and looked up at the door, he let out an "ah", struck speechless...`
`".........Wh‐`
`......what is this.........`
` .........hiiiiiiiii......"`
`Kumasawa screamed weakly, her face pallid...`
`That was no surprise...`
` Because, right there, .........on the door, ......just like the magic circle that had been drawn on the shutter of the rose garden storehouse,`
` there was another eerie shape drawn with paint that looked like blood.`
`However, it was dubious whether this one could be called a "magic circle".`
`...Because, unlike what most people would think of as a magic circle, it wasn't a circle with shapes drawn inside it,`
` but a slightly more geometrical shape.`
`......However, the strange non‐alphabetical characters written in the gaps of the figure were without doubt the same as the magic circle on the shutter...`
`But the thing that had Kanon struck speechless was not how eerie the magic circle was.`
`......Only moments ago, this hadn't been here...!!`
`He had returned to the kitchen for a short while.`
` He had then gone to the storehouse to grab a tool, and headed right back.`
`Put those together and it couldn't have been more than five minutes.`
`...How could someone add something this creepy during that period of time...?!`
`And as though it had just been drawn,`
` almost like the door itself was bleeding, several unsettling vertical red lines slowly dripped down, getting longer and longer......`
`"......hiiiiiiiiiii... ......hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii...!"`
`Kumasawa's knees gave way, and she sank down on the spot.`
`{n}...If Kumasawa hadn't done this first, then Kanon surely would have wanted to.`
`"......B‐{f:5:Beatrice}...sama..............."`
`"Hiiiiiiiiiii...!`
` It's the work of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, how horrid, how horrid...!!"`
`"...........................hh."`
`Kanon gulped, then readied the bolt cutter and approached the door.`
`...He didn't want to get close to this disturbing magic circle, and he really didn't want to touch the steadily dripping substance that looked like blood.`
`......But if he didn't get close, he couldn't cut the chain.`
`Fighting this cold feeling, he gulped again, and after gathering his courage, went even closer, putting the bolt cutter up against the chain.`
`......He then pressed with all of his strength, and cut through the chain far more easily than he had imagined.`
`The cut chain fell into two separate parts, which continued to clang as they swayed back and forth...`
`".........Kanon‐san,`
` .........by your feet, an envelope......`
` ...And isn't that...the Master's......"`
`It looked like Kumasawa had also noticed the Western‐style envelope at the bottom of the door.`
`{n}And that the sealing wax had been sealed with the Head's Ring.`
`Kanon was lost for a just a second over whether he should open the letter first or check inside the room,`
` but he decided on prioritizing his original purpose.`
`...Kanon pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket.`
`{n}This was so he wouldn't leave fingerprints on the door.`
`......If his worst fears had been realized, .........the police would want to investigate this room too...!!`
`He slowly pushed the door open...`
` He was able to hear the sound of the television that had been seeping out slightly more clearly now.`
`"........................Eva‐sama......?"`
`Eva was face up on the bed.`
`{n}......On the bed with her shoes still on...?`
`Kumasawa, who had fearfully entered after Kanon and who was hiding behind his back, screamed a short "hii!!" again when she saw Eva like that.`
`Eva's shoes had been the first part of her that Kanon had seen, so the incongruity of wearing shoes in bed was the first thing that entered his mind,`
` ...but after he shifted his line of sight towards Eva's head,`
` ...Kanon couldn't help but let out a short scream like Kumasawa...`
`Right in the middle...of Eva's forehead, ......something was...`
`{n}......set there?`
` Growing there...?`
`No.`
` ...Right in the center of her forehead,`
` ...an old‐fashioned "knife",`
` or some weapon like it, was stuck right in!!!`
`From the base where it was stuck in, blood dripped down, staining the sheets on the other side bright red...`
`Kumasawa's knees gave way once more, and she sank down on the floor.`
`{n}...Her mouth kept flapping open and closed, but she couldn't even scream.`
`......Eva, with some kind of weapon sticking out of her forehead, was dead.`
`Both eyes were open wide, and the image of the person who killed her must have been burned into them,`
` ...but the mouth with which to speak that truth had already been eternally sealed.`
`Even though that forehead was the last place they wanted to look, they couldn't tear their eyes from it...`
`Right there, the weapon was stuck into Eva's forehead, standing almost perfectly upright.`
`And on the handle was a design so complicated you could never expect to see it on an ordinary weapon.`
`......That thing...could be summed up with the word "occult".`
`{n}...It was a vulgar object, with a design that might have been of some demon.`
`"......What about Hideyoshi‐sama...?`
` ...Hideyoshi‐sama...!"`
`Eva was on top of her bed, but the other bed was empty.`
`...Where was Hideyoshi?!`
`After taking a backwards glance at Kumasawa, still on her knees and stupefied, he checked the bathroom just in case.`
`At the moment he opened the door, he was greeted by steam and the sound of the shower.`
`The bathroom was of the same familiar style as most hotel bathrooms, containing both a bath and a toilet.`
`When taking a shower, a waterproof curtain was used to keep water from flying out.`
`That waterproof curtain was half open,`
` ......and lying tumbled down in the bathtub was Hideyoshi, completely naked, both eyes still open—`
`and those eyes were pointing right at Kanon.`
`Just like Eva, a weapon with a demonic design was stuck into his forehead.`
`Since his head had been under the hot water of the shower the whole time, his face wasn't half covered and filthy with blood like Eva's had been,`
` ...but the sight of him dead while still taking a shower was tragic enough......`
`Just then, Natsuhi's voice rang through the hall.`
`{n}She was probably coming with Genji.`
`"......A‐again with this graffiti......`
` ...What about this letter...?`
` What does it say inside?"`
`"...I have not yet read it."`
`".........We shouldn't touch it carelessly...`
` The culprit's fingerprints might be left on it...`
` We should hand it over to the police..."`
`"......They went out of their way to leave it here.`
` I'm sure they wouldn't have left fingerprints."`
`Stating this with finality, Natsuhi picked up the envelope.`
`...And before checking its contents, she entered the room herself, ......where she found Eva, dead.`
`"E‐......Eva‐san......!!!!"`
`"......Madam... Hideyoshi‐sama is here, too............"`
`"Th‐......this is......`
`truly atrocious......"`
`"...Kanon, turn off the shower...`
` Don't let this be any more pitiful than it needs to...!"`
`"Y‐...yes."`
`Kanon gripped his handkerchief and twisted the valve, turning off the shower.`
`In the bathtub, a small bottle of body soap had fallen with its cap off.`
`......It really looked like he had been attacked right in the middle of taking a shower.`
`{n}......A spray of blood still clung slightly to the white bathtub, and the combination of red and white made a horrible contrast.`
`"............Doctor Nanjo..."`
`"...I, ......I understand......`
` ......No signs of postmortem lividity...`
` Rigor mortis hasn't begun either.`
` I'd say barely an hour has passed since they were killed, if that..."`
`"But even so, ......how a weapon with such a short handle could do that to the skull......`
` I cannot imagine..."`
`Nanjo checked their pulse and their pupils, making certain of their deaths once more.`
`...As Kanon watched this businesslike treatment, he thought.`
`{n}......Couldn't you tell at a glance that they're dead without doing all that?`
`Nanjo thought about removing the weapon,`
` but after deciding that where possible it would be better to hand the scene over to the police without disturbing it, he left it alone.`
`However, a close examination of the base revealed that it had no blade.`
`{n}...Or rather, it wasn't shaped like a flat blade, but was conical.`
`...He noticed that, rather than a knife, it was more like a short‐handled spear, something with a shape better suited for thrusting than slicing.`
`Rather than a short spear, some people might call it a thick icepick.`
`At any rate, the original hideous purpose for which this weapon with its unsettling design was made,`
` and exactly how that purpose was carried out, were both displayed here in such a glaring fashion that there was absolutely no need to use further words to describe it...`
`Natsuhi, hoping to escape the repulsive steam filling the bathroom as soon as she could,`
` covered her mouth with a handkerchief and dashed from the room...`
`Just viewing their gruesome bodies for an instant had been enough to burn the image into her eyes.`
` If she looked any longer, that image would surely remain in her vision for all eternity...`
`The rising urge to vomit was exactly the same feeling she'd had that morning at the gardening storehouse...`
`For a while, Natsuhi couldn't help but stand with her back facing the guest room, fighting that sickness in her stomach...`
`"......A‐.........anyway, we can't let the kids,`
` ...we can't let George‐kun see this room.`
` Quickly, close this room up...!"`
`".........Gra‐...gracious, no, it shouldn't be shown to them...`
` If George‐san saw his parents in this brutal state......"`
`But the recklessly approaching footsteps were obviously George's even before he came flying into the room.`
`George and the other children had been waiting in the parlor.`
`But when they had seen Genji call Natsuhi out, and had noticed her turn pale and fly out of the room, they had felt that he might have been the bearer of bad news.`
`And when they saw a large group of people gathered around the guest room, they were sure of it...`
`"Father!!!`
` Mother!!!"`
`".........Aaahh,`
` wha‐......what is this,`
` another......magic circle?!"`
`"...................................."`
`"Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi are safe, right?!`
` Hey, Kanon‐kun!`
` What's this all about?!"`
`"...Battler‐sama...`
` ................................."`
`Kanon didn't have to say anything; George's scream after he ran into the room told them everything they needed to know.`
`"......UwaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaa!!`
` Who,`
` ......who did this!!`
` I'll kill you, I'll kill you!!!"`
`"...George‐kun,`
` .........hang in there, dear......"`
`Natsuhi touched George's shoulder with her hand, but he violently shook her off.`
`...George collapsed to the floor beside Eva, and buried his face in the bed in front of his mother's face, wailing.`
`Then he pounded on the bed with his fist, over and over again...`
`".........Geor‐`
`...George nii‐san,`
` ......ha‐hang in there......`
` .........huh,`
` ...Battler?"`
`"............Battler‐sama..."`
`Battler.........had his back against the wall of the hallway,`
` ......and was, without restraint, covering his eyes with his right hand and weeping......`
`"Horrible......`
` ............That's horrible......`
` ......He proposed to the girl he loved and lost her the next day.`
` .........And on the same day, even his mom and dad were killed...`
` ............Isn't that...just way too harsh......"`
`...Of course, he felt sorry for everyone who had died.`
`{n}But Battler......felt far more sorry for those who had been left alone by the deaths of others.`
`Everyone here now had lost someone close to them.`
`{n}George wasn't the only one he felt sorry for.`
`......However, ...George's pain was far greater than everyone else's.`
`"..................Battler........."`
`"Sure, ...all people die sooner or later...`
` If you're human, the day's going to eventually come when you've got to fight the sorrow of losing someone close to you.`
` ...But still, shouldn't that day be far in the future for Aniki,`
` ......and shouldn't those deaths visit him one at a time...?!!"`
`"......Horrible...`
` That's too horrible......`
` ......Bastard......`
` Bastard.........!`
` Don't you have......the slightest bit of human compassion...?!!`
` Uuu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}uughhhh!!!"`
`".........Uu...`
` Battler, ...don't cry, don't cry..."`
`Maria tried to comfort Battler in a mechanical‐sounding voice...`
`{n}Battler violently wiped his tears.`
`"Aah...`
` Damn it, ...I won't cry anymore...`
` Tears of regret, tears of sadness, I won't shed them again..."`
`".........Yeah, it's no goddamn good at all.`
` The witch is backing us into a corner.`
` We're always on the defensive...!`
` And that's no good, it's no goddamn good!`
` I'll flip over the chessboard...!!`
` That bastard probably thinks of us like sheep, just cowering in fear until tomorrow with no way of running."`
`"...But guess what, I'll flip it over!!`
` That bastard can't escape this island until tomorrow either...!`
` We won't be the ones hiding away pissing ourselves, that fucker will!"`
`"I'll expose you, you'll see.`
` By tomorrow—`
`no, forget tomorrow, tonight.`
` Before this night's over I'll be gripping you by the collar...!!"`
`"......At any rate, we'll lock this room and leave everything as it is until the police come.`
` ......All agreed?"`
`Natsuhi proclaimed it as though she didn't care whether they agreed or not.`
`...If anyone had a right to object, it would have been George, ...but he looked as though he had shed enough tears.`
`Still facing away from them, George nodded slightly and rose to his feet, and everyone else agreed in response.`
`Natsuhi still hadn't opened the head's Western‐style envelope she had picked up.`
`{n}...But since they would all be leaving the room now, she decided that she would unseal it in the parlor, where everyone could watch.`
`As soon as they walked out into the hallway to head back to the parlor,`
` .........some of them immediately felt something out of place, ...or maybe sensed something strange.`
`"...............Uu.`
` ......Stinky."`
`"Ah, ...you notice it too, Maria?`
` ...What is this stench... It smells awful..."`
`As they all sniffed the air,`
` ...they did notice a horribly foul burnt smell, unlike anything any of them had ever smelled before, drifting through the hallway.`
`"......I will go quickly to check the kitchen...`
` I'm sure I turned the flame off......"`
`After noticing a burnt smell, it was natural that Kumasawa, who had just been cooking in the kitchen, suspected that her own clumsiness had caused it.`
` Kumasawa hastily dashed away.`
`"......Kanon, go with Kumasawa.`
` Do not let her be alone."`
`"Y‐yes...!"`
`After nodding at Genji's order, Kanon went chasing after her.`
`{n}...The others, although they did not run, also followed in order to search for the source of the smell.`
`"...Uu.`
` Stinky.`
` ......Uuu."`
`"It truly is......a stench that makes the nose wrinkle.`
` ...However, I am not sure it would be safe to open a window for ventilation..."`
`Natsuhi was reluctant to open the windows in a situation where self‐defense was so important.`
`"......Let us run the fan.`
` I do not believe there will be any need to open the windows."`
`"...George‐aniki.`
` ......Is it okay if I talk to you?"`
`"......If it's about finding the killer, then I have no problems."`
`It seemed that George had already climbed out of the abyss of his sorrow.`
`...All that filled his chest now was the quiet flame of hatred towards the killer who had stolen the lives of his beloved parents.`
`"...The chain for the room was set.`
` ...From what I could tell by looking at it, I'm positive that it couldn't be opened from the outside.`
` ......In other words, that means it was a perfect locked room."`
`".........Yes, it does.`
` In the case of the rose garden storehouse, they might have sneaked the shutter's key out of the servant room,`
` or maybe they had a duplicate key... I can imagine many ways they could've done it."`
`".........But this chain is different.`
` Among generally used locking techniques, a chain is the simplest one to create a locked room with."`
`"Only a chain will block everyone coming from the outside as long as it isn't physically broken.`
` So does this mean that the culprit couldn't have gone in or out through the door...?"`
`"......That's interesting.`
` Just a few hours ago, I seem to remember everyone making a fuss over how to get out of a room without using the door."`
`Back then, everyone had been making a fuss over how Grandfather had disappeared from his room.`
`Because of the receipt that Auntie Eva had stuck in the door on a whim, it was revealed that the door had remained sealed,`
` and since Aunt Natsuhi had been the only person to enter or exit during that time, she had come under suspicion.`
`Auntie Eva had proposed a theory about how Aunt Natsuhi might have thrown Grandfather out the window,`
` and left by the door herself.`
`But this door is much simpler.`
`It was sealed from the inside by the door chain.`
`{n}The window had also been closed from the inside, and the bodies had been in the room.`
`......This time it really was, without exaggeration, a true locked room.`
`...That's right.`
` If you include Grandfather's disappearance, three incidents have occurred, and all three times, the door has been the point of interest.`
`The first was the shutter.`
`There was a key in the servant room, and if we assume someone knew about that, this can't really be called a locked room.`
`The next was the door sealed by the receipt.`
`However, since Aunt Natsuhi had entered the room,`
` she could have let Grandfather out through the window, or thrown him out, and she would have been able to lock the window before leaving.`
`Or, like my crazy theory, he could have hidden until the receipt was gone, and left the room later.`
` ......Basically, this door can be defeated with a handful of desperate tricks.`
`In that sense, you really can't call this one a locked room either.`
`And now, we have the door sealed with the door chain.`
`...Finally, we have to give up.`
`{n}The window, the door...everything had been locked from the inside.`
` It was a perfect locked room.`
`The first hadn't been a locked room because everyone could be suspected.`
`{n}...The second hadn't been a locked room because Aunt Natsuhi could be suspected.`
`...But this time, no one can be suspected!`
`{n}This room was a perfect locked room, sealed by a door chain that denied access equally to everyone...!`
`"......In that case, did the culprit carry out the crime without entering the room...?`
` Some method from outside the room...?"`
`"Good thought...`
` It is a chain, so even though it can't be opened wide enough for a person to fit through, you can open it a small crack.`
` The culprit could knock on the door to make them peer out before attacking them, or...`
` Wait, ...is that naive...?"`
`"Yeah, it is.`
` .........If Auntie Eva's body had been lying right next to the door, then it might have been possible."`
`"But she was on the bed in the center of the room!`
` And Uncle Hideyoshi was even in the bathroom.`
` Looking from the crack in the door, you couldn't even see them, and you couldn't reach them with your hands either.`
` ......Damn it, this is no goddamn good at all, I don't have a clue!!"`
`......Something was tugging softly at my sleeve.`
` ...It was Maria.`
`"............Uu.`
` ...Satisfied?"`
`"What do you mean "satisfied"?"`
`".........Kihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` ...Battler, since you didn't want to doubt any of your relatives...you made a wish, saying that you wanted the culprit to be {f:5:Beatrice}, right?"`
`"Well, {f:5:Beatrice} granted your wish.`
` ...Just as you said, she did it "in a way that no human could, to make you believe in the witch"."`
`"............Yet you're being stubborn.`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi.`
` Ouch."`
`I tapped Maria, who was laughing unpleasantly, on the head with my fist.`
`"Sure, thanks for granting it.`
` That was an expression of my gratitude, and a free lesson in not laughing at times like this.`
` More importantly, tell me.`
` There was more mysterious graffiti on the door to Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi's room.`
` Was that another magic circle?!"`
`"......Kihihihihihihihi.`
` It has an especially memorable and characteristic design, so I'd hoped you'd at least know that one.`
` Ouch."`
`"I don't know, that's why I've handed the stage over to you.`
` Quit whining and explain."`
`".........You sure are violent, Battler.`
` I won't tell you if you're too mean, get it......?`
` Ouch!`
` Uu...... I'll say it, I'll say it, you brutish man.`
` .........That's the first magic circle of the moon."`
`"What does it mean?`
` What is this magic circle's benefit?!`
` What does the Hebrew writing mean?!"`
`"The words are from the Old Testament, Psalm 107, verse 16.`
` ......‘For he has broken the gates of brass and cut through bars of iron’.`
` ......This magic circle has two effects.`
` First, it can open any door regardless of the method used to lock it."`
`"That sure is convenient magic.`
` ...So your witch is proclaiming this to be a door that can't be opened without relying on the power of magic...?!`
` And the other effect?!"`
`"It takes the unopening door as a representation of an unassailable situation, and opens it.`
` ......By using it in a difficult situation, it gives you a solution you hadn't even thought of until then.`
` ......To put it simply, it grants the powers of observation and discernment, inspiration and intuition."`
`"............Kihihihihihihihihihi.`
` {f:5:Beatrice} is trying to provoke you lowly humans, since she thinks there's no way you could ever understand how this door was opened.`
` Kihhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi..."`
`"Ouch."`
`"Alright, good work, now shut up.`
` ......Suits me fine. I accept that witch's challenge!"`
`"......Maria‐chan.`
` ...Things like witches and demons don't exist in this world.`
` ...Someone killed Mother and Father!`
` I don't know whether that was someone I know or not.`
` But either way, it was definitely a human...!!"`
`".........Yeah, but......how?`
` How did they reach them through a crack in the door that couldn't have been more than ten centimeters wide...!"`
`"At any rate, I can hardly stand this stench.`
` ......What in the world could it be...?!"`
`Kanon and Kumasawa, who had gone ahead, realized before they even reached the kitchen that the smell wasn't coming from there.`
`That was because, on their way to the kitchen, they noticed that an even thicker wave of stench was rising up from the stairs leading to the basement.`
`".........The boiler room..."`
`"......I wonder if there's something wrong with the boiler again..."`
`Those stairs led to the underground boiler room.`
`The mansion's boiler was old, and had been playing up recently.`
`{n}Both of them had witnessed problems with the boiler on several occasions, but they had never smelled it belching out a stench like this before.`
`Slam.`
`"Wh‐what was that sound......?!"`
`The sound that they had heard from the basement had definitely been the sound of a door closing.`
`{n}......Although she did phrase it as a question, Kumasawa too had already realized that the sound couldn't have been anything else.`
`Kumasawa was so surprised at that sound that her knees gave way yet again and she cowered...`
`......Because, {i:at that very moment, no one could have been in the boiler room}.`
`Just a few seconds ago, everyone had been crowded together in Eva and Hideyoshi's room!`
`{n}So who caused the sound of a door closing just now?!`
`".................................!"`
`"Kanon‐san...!!"`
`Instantly gathering the situation, Kanon ran down towards the basement...!`
`Since they had heard the sound of a door closing just now, and there was no trace of someone climbing the stairs, it meant that the person who had closed the door was now inside the boiler room.`
`If the boiler room had been a dead end, Kanon wouldn't have rushed in so hastily.`
`...But Kanon was a servant, so he knew.`
`{n}There were two entrances, one that opened to the mansion and one that opened to the courtyard.`
`If he didn't chase them now, they might slip away...!`
`Kumasawa reached the same conclusion long after Kanon did.`
`{n}...But she couldn't let him go alone...!`
`If the thing in the boiler room was the killer,`
` ...an opponent who had easily killed six adults in the first murder,`
` then Kanon would be no match if he simply confronted them alone.`
`...Of course, by this argument, Kumasawa joining him alone wouldn't mean anything, but...`
`At any rate, after a delay, Kumasawa decided that she mustn't let Kanon go alone, and she dashed down the stairs...!!`
`At that time, Kanon was already in the boiler room.`
`The boiler room's characteristic damp heat tormented him.`
`{n}...It had always been an unpleasantly smelly and hot place.`
`And on top of that, the room was full of that horrible stench...which made Kanon feel like he was going to be sick.`
`......There was no doubt that this room was the origin.`
`In that case, Kanon should have been searching for where the smell was coming from.`
`However, Kanon kept gazing straight forward as he grabbed a hatchet from a tool shelf just off to the side of the door.`
`...He hadn't stretched out his hand because he'd wanted a hatchet.`
` ...He had wanted to grab a weapon, any weapon.`
` ...Why?`
`"..................................................."`
`Kanon gazed into the darkness where the naked light bulb couldn't pierce.`
`{n}......Then, he {i:answered}.`
`"..................In roulette, you bet on a number or the colors red or black, vying for a payoff.`
` ......However, low risk bets like red or black only offer a similarly low payoff."`
`The words coming from Kanon's mouth...were swallowed up by the darkness.`
`That darkness suddenly started to swirl, glittering...`
`It was......a very fantastical scene...`
`Golden sparkling butterflies that hid in the shadows all over the boiler room...`
`flapped their wings, twinkling beautifully, ...and disappeared into the darkness, gathering together...`
`Kanon continued speaking, directing his words at the darkness as it swallowed the butterflies up.`
`{n}......But as the butterflies gathered in the darkness, they...{0}...{0}...perhaps...{0}probably...{0}no, they must have...{0}...laughed.`
`...But Kanon continued to speak without faltering in the slightest.`
`"...On the other hand, if you bet on something of a lower probability, you receive a payoff proportional to the risk.`
` ............The Master called succeeding despite an astronomical risk a "miracle",`
` and called the astronomical payoff gained as a result "magic"."`
`"............I have no interest what kind of "magic" you and the Master were seeking when you spun that roulette......`
` But you forgot something.`
` ......You forgot that roulette has a pocket that is neither red nor black."`
`Roulette has a special pocket called "0", which means that the house takes everything in certain variants of the game—`
`meaning that all of the coins bet on the table will be swept up, just as though everyone has forfeit...`
`".........I set my heart on one thing.`
` ...That if...`
`......Shannon were to be killed, and I was left alive,`
` .........I would bring this roulette of yours to ruin even at the cost of my life...!"`
`"............This isn't one of the Master's rules, ...and it certainly isn't one of yours.`
` .........I made this rule myself.`
` .........I'm not furniture anymore.`
` .........I'm the zero on your roulette...!"`
`...Kanon's face twisted with humiliation.`
`{n}.........It was clear that he had been dealt ridicule in response to his self‐denial.`
`Kanon's brow creased even further, ...and a furious expression that he had never shown anyone appeared on his face.`
`......The hand grasping the hatchet was shaking.`
` ...His sweat became drops which slid down...`
`It was clear that the emotion causing Kanon's hand to shake was not anger alone.`
`...However, Kanon suppressed that emotion...`
`".....................I won't let your words lead me astray again.`
` .........This is where the Demons' Roulette ends."`
`"...W‐`
`......wait another thousand years in hell for your next summoner,`
` {f:5:Beatriceeeeeeee}!!!"`
`When Kanon swung the hatchet upwards and tried to dive into the darkness, the darkness definitely sneered.`
`It sneered at that courage as vulgar, lazy, futile, and meaningless.`
`......Kanon, his hatchet still held aloft,`
` .........couldn't take another step after that...`
`With a clang,`
` the hatchet that Kanon had been grasping fell and rolled on the floor...`
`And following that, with a pair of thuds,`
` Kanon's knees hit, ...left, then right...`
`That hand, which looked like it was trying to catch the sky now that the hatchet had been dropped, gradually lowered,`
` ......and rested on his chest.`
` Then, the other hand did the same.`
`......Right there, ......was a handle with a demon‐shaped design engraved upon it.`
`{n}The same type of weapon that had been stabbed into Eva and Hideyoshi's foreheads......was in Kanon's chest......`
`"...............u`
`.....................ghh,`
` ............"`
`Fresh blood dribbled from the corner of Kanon's mouth as it twisted in anguish...`
`{n}...It was...makeup too powerful for Kanon's white skin...`
`Around this scene, the glittering gold butterflies danced mesmerizingly through the darkness...`
`It was a beautiful, beautiful dance—a funeral march of tribute, ridicule, and contempt for a single boy's self‐sacrifice.`
`...Kanon had already been prepared for his own death,`
` ......but he attempted one last measure of resistance, to reject death in at least the form it had been delivered to him.`
`...With both hands, he grasped the handle of the weapon sticking into his chest,`
` ............and gritting his teeth at the acute, unearthly pain...............`
` ..............................he pulled it out.`
`For only a moment, a bright‐red spray gushed out.`
`......It made an unpleasant bloop sound.`
`It probably resembled the sound of Kanon's soul as it was sucked into the swamp of the dead...`
`"...............Kanon‐san?!`
` Hiiiiiiiii!!!`
` So‐someoooooooone!!`
` Hiiiiiiiii!!"`
`Kumasawa screamed at the incomprehensible sight in front of her.`
`Kanon was lying in a pool of blood...`
`{n}...Kumasawa's heart was a complete mess.`
`Aah, what a terrible fate!`
`{n}He wouldn't have been killed if I had been with him!`
`Aah, what incredible fortune!`
`{n}If I had been with him, I might have been killed too!!`
`As she screamed, her expression was filled with complete confusion, and all of the muscles of her face were pulled up, almost as though she was smiling while crying...`
`{n}No one could have made fun of an expression such as this...!!`
`"What is it, Kumasawa?!!`
` Answer me, Kumasawa!!!"`
`The first one to dash in was Natsuhi, with rifle at the ready.`
`Battler and Genji dashed in after her.`
`Normally, they probably would've started discussing the origin of that violent stench filling the boiler room.`
`......But after they saw Kanon, who was lying on the ground as if he were drowning in an ocean of his own blood, the stench wasn't important any more.`
`"Kanon!`
` Answer me!!`
` ......Genji, bring Doctor Nanjo here!!"`
`Natsuhi realized that even though Kanon was on the verge of death, he was still conscious, so she sent Genji to get the doctor.`
`...Natsuhi, holding the rifle aloft, faced the darkness in the center of the boiler room and shouted!`
`"......Who is hiding over there?!!!`
` Come out quietly!!`
` If you don't come out from there, I'll shoot without mercy!!"`
`"A flashlight!`
` Auntie, let's light 'em up!!"`
`Battler, thinking quickly, took a large flashlight from the tool shelf alongside the door and used its light to cut through the darkness Natsuhi was glaring into.`
`But the light only shone on mechanical‐looking piping and a door.`
`The door had been left open a small crack, and it was obvious that someone had left through there in a hurry.`
`"......Aunt Natsuhi, where does that door go?!"`
`"G‐Genji...!`
` Where does that door lead to?!"`
`"...The, the courtyard...!"`
`"L‐like hell I'd let you get away, you damn bastaaaaaaaard!!!"`
`Battler let out a war cry as he slammed into the door.`
`Cool air from outside suddenly rushed in.`
`...There were some thin, rough stairs leading up.`
`{n}...Battler ran up them, shouting!`
`"Wait, Battler‐kun!!`
` It's dangerous to be alone!!"`
`Natsuhi also rushed up the stairs, chasing after Battler.`
`At the top was the courtyard.`
`{n}...The courtyard of the mansion had been built strictly for lighting purposes, so it wasn't a very elegant place.`
`Because it was surrounded on all sides, the air was calm and completely undisturbed, even though they could hear the sound of strong winds.`
`There was only the gentle, sorrowful rain...`
`Through the cold scattered raindrops, Battler dashed up the stairs and into the courtyard, where he looked in every direction.`
`......Of course, the odds of him finding a suspicious silhouette just standing around nonchalantly were pretty much zero...`
`Battler turned around, looking in all directions.`
` He turned again and again.`
`{n}He kept spinning until he almost lost his sense of direction.`
`{n}He prayed that he would see the culprit somewhere in this scenery...!`
`But there was no chance.`
` All he saw as he spun was more and more of the mansion's heartless walls and windows...!`
`Furthermore, there were two entrances into the mansion from the courtyard, and neither of them were locked.`
`Because the courtyard couldn't be entered from outside the mansion, the doors had been built without locks.`
`......He couldn't tell which one they had left through!`
`{n}He had to give up.`
`Battler pounded the wall with his fist, swearing...`
`"......Battler‐kun!!`
` You mustn't run ahead by yourself!!`
` ........................`
` ............Battler‐kun......?"`
`Battler put his head against the wall, ...and scratched at it with his fingernails as he cried...`
`".........Shit, ......shit, shit...!!`
` Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi!`
` And now Kanon‐kun too?!!!`
` You killed six whole people!!`
` And that wasn't enough, so you killed three more!!"`
`"Fuck you, fuck youuuuuuu!!`
` Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi were always fun and kind to us...!!`
` I just met Kanon‐kun yesterday, but I'm sure I'd have gotten along fine with him!`
` Why did you kill them?!!"`
`"Why, why...?!!!`
` When people die, they don't come back to life again, you know?!`
` They aren't gonna quickly sprout up again like bamboo shoots!`
` .........Why would you kill them?!`
` Why...`
` Why...?!!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh...!!"`
`...Battler was a boy who could understand the feelings of pain and regret in a person's heart.`
`{n}...So he cried.`
` With all his strength.`
`Natsuhi, who had always thought of Battler as a strong person, was a little surprised to find that he had this delicate side,`
` ...and at the same time, understood how easily hurt the heart of a young person could be, so she held him.`
`"........................It's alright.`
` ...I will definitely protect you, George‐kun, Maria‐chan, and Jessica.`
` .........As a mother, ...and as the representative of the Ushiromiya family...!"`
`"......uuuUUuuUuuUUUuughhhu!!`
` AaaaaaAAAAAAAAhhh!!"`
`Battler, after sobbing into Natsuhi's chest for a while,`
` wiped his tears with a bitter smile, and tried to convey that he had cried more than enough already, just as he had done the times before...`
`"Anyway, let's go back down for now.`
` ......Protecting ourselves is a higher priority than finding the culprit.`
` Tomorrow, the boat will arrive.`
` After that happens, the police will come, and everything should be brought to light.`
` .........There's no way the killer can escape this island, no matter how much they struggle...!!"`
`"......Right.`
` ...When the police come..."`
`When the seagulls cry, ...the crime will be solved.`
`But, ...for some reason, Battler felt a slight sense of uneasiness...as if the seagulls would never cry again.`
`......That couldn't be true.`
`{n}When the typhoon passes, the lively seagulls should return to the harbor again......`
`I returned to the boiler room along with Aunt Natsuhi and told the room weakly that we hadn't found anything.`
`They told me that Doctor Nanjo and George‐aniki had carried Kanon‐kun to the servant room.`
`The servant room had a first‐aid kit and a sink, and could apparently function as a nurse's office.`
`Kumasawa‐san and Jessica had accompanied them.`
`...Stains from Kanon‐kun's blood remained on the floor.`
`Judging by the large amount of blood lost and the ruthless shape of the weapon that had fallen unceremoniously to the ground,`
` ......I figured that Doctor Nanjo's treatment would probably end in vain...`
`That weapon was doubtlessly the same type that had been stuck in Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi's foreheads.`
`......But wait, isn't the demonic design on the handle a little different...?`
`There seemed to be some small differences in that part.`
` Still, as far as their overall shape was concerned, the weapons were all of the same type.`
`Though it had seemed brutal, we'd left the weapons stuck into Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi to preserve the crime scene.`
`...So this was the first time I was able to have a perfect view of the entire weapon.`
`Indeed, the weapon was not bladed like a knife, but shaped like an icepick,`
` ...or rather, a thin stake.`
`And also, ...it had a spiral‐shaped design, sort of like a drill?`
`...To use a disturbing analogy, it looked like something that might be driven into the hearts of human sacrifices in some demonic ritual...`
`Including the handle, it was about twenty‐five centimeters long.`
` Half of that was the stake‐shaped part, which was stained with deep red blood.`
`......The length of the blood‐stained part made it clear just how deeply it must have penetrated into Kanon‐kun's chest...`
`But Aunt Natsuhi and the rest were not even looking at the weapon, instead standing in front of the incinerator, where the horrible stench was emanating from.`
`They had probably pulled {i:that} out of the furnace, where it must have been burning.`
`...It was still smoldering and kept sending out dense waves of that awfully unpleasant smell...`
`Genji‐san and Maria were staring down at it.`
`Aunt Natsuhi probably couldn't stand to look directly at it.`
` ...She kept shaking her head, her back to it.`
`"........................ug...!"`
`...I'd thought that after everything that's happened, nothing could surprise me anymore, but...`
`...this was...`
`...gghh...!`
`I stood there for a while, moaning, with a rising urge to vomit...`
`.........The true nature of that unearthly stench...`
`......was the charred smell from within the incinerator...`
`of a burning corpse......`
`The clothes, the surface of the body, and the hair were all hideously burned.`
` That grotesque corpse was in a state where not the face, nor the age, nor even the gender could be guessed at...`
`But when I thought about it calmly, I realized that a corpse appearing at this time could only be one person.`
`.........Grandfather,`
` who had disappeared that morning, and whose whereabouts had been unknown.`
`".........I believe...it is most likely the Master."`
`"...............I...agree.`
` ............That he would pass away in such a state......`
` .........How heartrending..."`
`"...But is there any proof that this corpse......really is Grandfather...?`
` It's burnt so black, you can't even tell what sex it is..."`
`"Battler‐kun, ...look at the feet."`
`Aunt Natsuhi, with her handkerchief over her mouth and her eyes averted, pointed and told me to look at the burnt corpse's feet.`
`..................?`
`"......The toes, on both feet. Look closely."`
`"Huh?`
` ..................ah,`
` ......you're right........."`
`Just as Genji‐san had said, there were six toes on each foot.`
`Each of the toes had been arranged so normally that I hadn't noticed...`
`"......The Master had these uniquely characteristic toes since birth.`
` ...Consequently, the Master was entrusted with the revival of the Ushiromiya family."`
`"I have heard that since long ago, cases of polydactyly were common in the Ushiromiya family.`
` ...It's probably hereditary."`
`Polydactyly literally means "many fingers".`
`Because of a little mistake by God when the person is born, one of their toes or fingers splits into two, and the total number increases.`
`But a big deal isn't usually made of polydactyly in the world at large.`
`{n}That's because it isn't a disease, but something people are born with.`
`So the hospital is already aware of it when they are still babies, and at about the time they turn one year old, they are given surgery to make them normal.`
`So, even if a child has polydactyly, it is treated before they become self‐aware, so they might not even remember it themselves.`
`Incidentally, it seems that it can occur with a probability of about one in every two thousand babies,`
` so even though it's not usually seen, it isn't that rare at all.`
`Speaking of which, I think Uncle Hideyoshi mentioned something to me long ago.`
` ...Something about how even Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the man who unified Japan at the end of the Sengoku period, possessed six fingers on one hand...`
`According to Aunt Natsuhi, among the many Ushiromiya family heads, the ones praised most for their wisdom had all possessed polydactyly.`
`......Because of that, when Grandfather was born, his relatives were all excited at the thought that he might become another wise leader.`
` And, when the leading relatives all died in the Great Kanto Earthquake, it was apparently argued that if anyone could restore the family from that,`
` it would be Grandfather, because of the auspicious sign of his birth.`
`If Grandfather thought being the head was not a bad gig, this sixth toe must have been pretty lucky for him.`
`......Come to think of it, I think I've heard about some country where it's believed that people with polydactyly should be treated as gods and revered...`
`This is beside the point, but it's fairly common in mystery novels for a corpse to be burned to hide whose body it is.`
`......But it looks like in Grandfather's case, just being toasted wasn't enough to hide the proof of his identity...`
`And......Grandfather's body was not simply burnt.`
`......Just like Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi, ...and Kanon‐kun too, who had been stabbed in his chest,`
` he had one of those "demon's icepicks"...stuck into his forehead......!`
`"............The "Head's Ring" is not on his finger."`
`"...So everything is as the letter last night said.`
` ..................Father...`
`...would probably be horribly disappointed......"`
`Aunt Natsuhi let her head droop and closed her eyes tightly...`
`......This room had also become a vital crime scene for us to hand over to the police.`
`......It was decided that we would leave Grandfather's corpse here and lock the room, sealing it.`
`It wasn't clear when Grandfather's corpse started burning in the incinerator.`
`Since, according to Genji‐san, the flames hadn't been that strong, the body must have started burning a long time ago,`
` and that stench must have slowly crept out of the furnace and filled the room bit by bit, eventually pouring out and climbing up the staircase.`
`......Putting aside whether he was rare or well‐done,`
` Grandfather had been brought out, killed, and burned...even though he had started out in the locked room created by his auto‐lock.`
` ...There's probably no doubting this...`
`However, according to Genji‐san, the boiler room is usually locked.`
`......The probability that someone outside our group was lurking around committing the crimes was now overwhelmingly high,`
` and there was also a good chance that this person was walking around with something like a master key.`
`...After all, the doors and windows throughout the mansion had been checked.`
`But despite that, the culprit was freely strutting around the mansion.`
`After this latest crime, can we now be sure that a 19th person exists?`
`{n}They haven't shown themselves once, and yet they're trying to tout their existence.`
`Along with Kyrie‐san's chessboard theory, I've been using this contradiction to deny the existence of a 19th person.`
`...By flipping over the chessboard once more,`
` the very fact that this crime makes it perfectly obvious that a 19th person exists...`
`means that the existence of the 19th person is even less possible.`
` As long as that 19th person doesn't show themselves in front of us...!`
`......If the culprit could get Grandfather out through the door sealed by the receipt,`
` if they could kill Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi from the other side of a door sealed by a chain,`
` ......then is it possible for them to even create a fictional 19th person through strange tricks and devices...?!?!`
`If we still want to believe that the culprit is among us,`
` ......then the list of suspects is very short.`
`The four of us kids, Aunt Natsuhi.`
`{n}Genji‐san,`
` Kumasawa baa‐chan,`
` and Doctor Nanjo.`
`{n}...One of these people has to be the culprit!`
`Wait, we can't be sure of that.`
` ......Just a second ago, we started doubting whether the body here was actually Grandfather's, right?`
`...Maybe we should try thinking of the other bodies in the same way.`
`For example, the first six all had their faces horribly destroyed.`
`......Some of the bodies had kept enough of their faces for us to confirm who they were, but my old bastard, for example...`
`had lost his entire face, as though it had been peeled off...`
`We'd only figured out which body was which by their clothes and surroundings...`
`Had the culprit prepared a fake corpse beforehand and disguised it to make it look like they'd died...then hid somewhere and continued their killing spree...?`
`...It sounds ridiculous, but that doesn't mean it's an impossible trick.`
`......It's too early to give in to this 19th person,`
` ......no, .........this witch......!`
`"Maria‐chan, you mustn't stare so fixedly anymore.`
` Come on, Battler‐kun too.`
` I am worried about Kanon's condition, and I don't want to stay in a place like this any longer than I have to.`
` Let's go back."`
`"......Uu."`
`Maria hadn't gone out with everyone else, but had remained in the boiler room.`
`The thing she was staring fixedly at was probably...`
`not Grandfather's body, but the "demon's icepick" that was sticking out of his forehead.`
`...No doubt an irresistible item for the obsessed.`
`I rapped her on the head.`
`"Hey, Maria.`
` ......What's {f:5:Beatrice} after?`
` Is it all of our lives...?"`
`"......Kihihihihihihihi.`
` {f:5:Beatrice} will revive very soon.`
` ...At that time, none shall be left alive.`
` ...Kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi."`
`"How can you laugh at something like that?`
` Do you think you're the only one who's safe?`
` Why don't you feel like you're in danger?`
` Why aren't you scared?!"`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice} promised me.`
` ...She said that she's going to take me to the Golden Land."`
`".........It's a wonderful place where you have no obligations, everyone's always together, and everyone is always nice to everyone else."`
`".........I'm looking forward to it, you know?`
` That time will come, very soon now.`
` ...Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi..."`
`...Just what kind of person is Maria...?`
`.........I only know what Maria was like six years ago, when she was three.`
`{n}She had been pure and obedient—a good kid.`
`This new Maria six years later and the Maria I knew, ...didn't seem to fit together.`
`......Just who is she, this "witch" who calls herself Maria...?`
`To her, with her obstinate belief in witches,`
` ......this series of unsolvable crimes is proof that witches actually exist.`
`Every time something occurs that would be difficult for a human, it becomes a little harder for the rest of us to not believe in that witch called {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`It must be an "intense pleasure" for Maria...to see her relatives, who once firmly denied the witch's existence,`
` start acknowledging her existence one by one...`
`......Is that why she's in high spirits...?`
`".........Maria,`
` let me ask this one more time.`
` You'll probably answer the same anyway, but I'll ask just once more."`
`"Uu...?"`
`"...Yesterday, you were given a letter in the rose garden.`
` ......Who gave it to you...?!"`
`"Uu.`
` ...Like I said, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...You still don't believe.`
` Uu."`
`Maria only repeated what she had already said.`
`......Maria had met with the 19th person, the witch.`
`Had that really been a 19th person, or had that been one of the 18, who told her to say otherwise?`
`All that's certain is that Maria has been with the rest of us constantly, has always had an alibi, and hasn't done anything that would put her under suspicion.`
`......She's simply overjoyed at being made {f:5:Beatrice}'s messenger, and certainly is not our 19th person.`
` ..................I think.`
`That's right,`
` I wonder what's written in the letter we picked up in Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi's room...`
` Aunt Natsuhi should still have it with her...`
`......In the end, Kanon‐kun did not regain consciousness.`
`Even though Doctor Nanjo and the rest did all they could to heal him...`
`{n}...There was very little that could be done on an island like this without medicine or proper facilities...`
`However, Kanon‐kun was the only human ever to confront the culprit.`
`{n}If only he could give us some kind of clue...`
`But by the time he was carried here, it was already...`
`......too late.`
`".........My sincere apologies.`
` Without proper facilities, there was nothing I could do about such a serious wound..."`
`"...No, that's perfectly understandable.`
` Thank you so much for giving it your very best."`
`Doctor Nanjo's shirt had been sprayed by a violent spurt of blood, so it was easy to imagine the devotion with which he had tried to save Kanon‐kun's life, up until the very last second.`
`Jessica was crouched in the corridor, crying in anguish.`
`{n}......She had probably been taking care of Kanon‐kun until the moment of his death.`
`George‐aniki tried to approach her with words of comfort, but when Jessica pushed him away,`
` he stopped trying to interfere and left her alone.`
`"............If only I hadn't let Kanon‐san go alone...... ......ooohhhh..."`
`"......Don't let that bother you.`
` ...Even if you had been with him, you may have been attacked as well.`
` ......He foolishly jumped forward and paid for his mistake."`
`"How can you say it like that?!`
` Kanon‐kun spotted the killer and bravely stood up to them!!`
` If only Kumasawa‐san had gone with him, the killer might have hesitated and chosen to run away!!"`
`Emotion‐filled words that I never thought I'd hear from the normally tactful Jessica tumbled out of her mouth.`
`...Kumasawa, looking truly sorry, could do nothing but hang her head...`
`"Jessica..."`
`".........Now isn't the time for words.`
` ...Even I feel as if— ......and probably you're the same?`
` As if I don't have the first clue what's going on anymore—as if my heart is going to split open......"`
`There were tears in George‐aniki's eyes again.`
`{n}...Seeing Jessica break down crying probably brought back the pain of losing his parents.`
`............I had already cried myself dry.`
`{n}...So I didn't want to cry anymore.`
`...However, I felt myself the pain in their hearts.`
`"............It's alright, Jessica onee‐chan.`
` .........You'll be able to meet Kanon again soon."`
`"...Stop it!`
` You aren't helping...!"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice} will revive the dead, and even the love they possessed.`
` ......So, you'll definitely be able to meet him soon.`
` Then everyone will be able to live in peace."`
`"This {f:5:Beatrice}, who you say gave you that letter yesterday, is she the one who killed Kanon‐kun?!`
` Where is she?!`
` Where is she hiding?!"`
`"I'll find her and tear her limb from limb!!!`
` Say it! You know, don't you?! You know who the killer really is!!`
` What do you know and what are you hiding?!!`
` Tell me, damn it!!!!!!!!"`
`"Mi‐......Milady, please stop...!"`
`"Uu!`
` Uu!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} exiiists!`
` "Exiiists"!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Dammit, let go of me, Genji‐san!!`
` Maria knows who the killer is!!`
` And she's been hiding it on purpose!`
` She must be telling them what we're doing, guiding them as they kill us!!"`
`"Jessica, be silent!!"`
`Jessica rushed at Maria and grabbed hold of her...`
`Genji tried to stop her, but Jessica could not be calmed.`
` ...The next thing I heard was the sound of Aunt Natsuhi slapping Jessica's face.`
`After that, only Jessica's sorrowful sobbing voice resounded throughout the hall...`
`"......Maria‐chan.`
` ...I know that there's no way you're one of the culprits.`
` ...You have been with us since the beginning, and there was no time for you to communicate with any killer."`
`"............So, I want you to tell me something.`
` ......This "{f:5:Beatrice}" who handed you the letter yesterday, ...who was she?"`
`......Although those words seemed kind, ...they clearly showed that George still had some doubts about Maria.`
`......He hadn't tackled Maria.`
`{n}However, he felt exactly the same way Jessica did.`
`"......Aniki.`
` I asked her the same thing only just now.`
` ...The answer won't be any different."`
`"I want to hear it from Maria‐chan's mouth.`
` ......Who is {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"........................`
` Even if I tell you, you won't......believe me anyway."`
`"What do you mean by that?!`
` ...Is it possible that the killer is someone we know well,`
` ...and that, for some reason, you're covering for them by remaining silent?!`
` Who gave you that letter?!"`
`"............I got it from {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I'll say it no matter how many times you ask.`
` I got the letter from {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi.`
` George onii‐chan, do you refuse to believe in {f:5:Beatrice} because she's not an opponent you can hit?"`
`"You want to turn your feelings of helplessness into violence and beat someone up.`
` So you won't be satisfied unless your opponent is a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} you can hit."`
`".........So even if I tell you the truth, you won't be able to accept it.`
` So it's pointless for me to tell you.`
` You won't believe."`
`"............But I will keep on saying it.`
` I'll say it because it's true.`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice} "exists"!`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi...!`
` The door to the Golden Land will soon be opened.`
` And that's where I'm going.`
` {f:5:Beatrice} promised!"`
`"In that world, Mama is nice, and Papa is with us and is also nice.`
` I want to go there right away.`
` ......Everyone is afraid of {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` And that is only natural.`
` ......But calm yourselves.`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice} told me herself."`
`"{i:By the time the typhoon has passed, she will have ended everything.}`
` Kihihihi`
`...ouch."`
`"......Maria, I actually don't dislike you being talkative, but let's leave it at that for now.`
` ...I'll bet this is all a pretty happy situation for you, since you're always going on about how witches exist, but keep that to yourself for the time being.`
` Leave everyone else out of it."`
`"Uu."`
`"Th‐this brat, I've long thought she was creepy,`
` ......but she's actually screwed up, somehow she's screwed up!!"`
`"Don't you think so, Battler?! Genji‐san?!`
` Kumasawa‐san?!`
` What about you, Mom?!!`
` Maria knows who the killer is and she's hiding it!`
` Sure, maybe she hasn't directly done anything!"`
`"But she's definitely the killer's accomplice!!`
` That's right, she's a spy!`
` We can't let her stay with us any longer!!!"`
`"...........................Kihihihi."`
`".........Maria‐chan.`
` ...You must learn that there are some times where indiscreet discussion must be avoided.`
` If you continue to add any more oil to the fire, even I will get very angry."`
`".................."`
`Aunt Natsuhi glared at Maria with frightening eyes.`
`...Maria was used to Auntie Rosa's loud style of scolding, but she apparently hadn't developed a resistance to this kind of silent telling‐off.`
` ...She shrugged and kept her mouth shut.`
`A desolate feeling filled the room...`
`{n}It felt as though things would just get more complicated if anyone spoke.`
`......How many people had already died?`
`Six in Dad's group.`
` Also, both Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi; Kanon‐kun; Grandfather.`
`.........There were a whole eighteen people on this island.`
`{n}...Ten of those had been killed.`
`More than half of us had been killed.`
` ......And at this stage, there was absolutely no guarantee that the remaining eight were going to be alright...`
`"......Anyway, now is not the time for discord.`
` ......Now that we are certain that the killer can enter and leave the mansion at will and strike out of nowhere,`
` we must give our undivided attention to surviving until tomorrow."`
`"...I agree strongly with Aunt Natsuhi.`
` ......We can take our time racking our brains over the culprit later tonight.`
` For now, we should consider where to barricade ourselves in."`
`As I said this, I pointed out the clock to everyone.`
`It was already eight at night.`
` ...We had been receiving shocks over and over again since the early morning, and both our bodies and our minds were completely tired out.`
`......There was still a long, long time until tomorrow.`
` We needed to find some place to barricade ourselves in, somewhere we could rest our bodies and feel even the slightest bit safe...`
`".........I agree...`
` Everyone is already pushing their mental and physical limits, myself included.`
` I believe it would be wise to consider our plans immediately..."`
`"Settled, then.`
` .........There's a high probability that the enemy has the equivalent of a master key."`
`"...Were Shannon, Kanon‐kun and Gohda‐san holding master keys?"`
`".........Yes.`
` As long as they were on duty, they would have had them."`
`"...We didn't want to disturb the scene, so we didn't investigate this, but we can't eliminate the possibility that a key had been stolen from one of them."`
`".........Even before that, we know there's a chance that the culprit visited the servant room at some point in time so that they could unlock the shutter to the rose garden shed.`
` I think it very likely that they had already obtained a master key while there."`
`There were many servants serving the Ushiromiya family.`
`{n}Because of that, there were several master keys.`
`Furthermore, every time the shifts changed, the keys were passed between servants.`
` She had to admit that the arrangement had been somewhat sloppy.`
`"Assuming they did borrow a bundle of keys from the pocket of one of the murdered servants,`
` is there any safe place that even those keys couldn't open...?"`
`".........Because of the nature of our jobs, we have been entrusted with keys to all of the rooms...`
` All of them in the mansion and in the guesthouse..."`
`"So in other words, ......no matter where we hole up and lock ourselves in, it'd just be pointless.`
` ...Fine by me, who needs goddamn locks?! If you're gonna come, come on, dammit!`
` I'll kill you first!!"`
`".........The enemy won't approach us from the front.`
` I don't know about the first six, but if we look at what happened to my parents and Kanon‐kun,`
` ...and even Grandfather, the enemy has only gone after isolated people.`
` They don't have the power to assault all of us openly in a secure room."`
`"That's right.`
` It's just like Aniki says.`
` ......Maybe Auntie's rifle can serve to stave off the enemy."`
`"............I hope that is so, but..."`
`".............................."`
`"Maria, I know you want to say something, but keep it to yourself and stay quiet for a while."`
`"...Uu."`
`Maria probably wanted to say that witches weren't afraid of things like guns, or something like that.`
`But if she were to say it out loud, the atmosphere around here would start to get pretty edgy.`
`{n}I had noticed and decided to put a stop to it...`
`"...............If I may.`
` There is one place that cannot be entered even with the servants' keys."`
`"Where is that?"`
`"......Very well.`
` It is the Master's study."`
`"I, ...I'm against this!!`
` I don't even wanna think about going in Grandfather's creepy room!"`
`"How many keys can gain access to that room?"`
`"......There are two.`
` I always have one of them.`
` The other was held by the Master himself, but just now, from the body in the boiler room..."`
`Genji‐san took a handkerchief out of his pocket and opened it, showing us the burnt and filthy key to the study.`
`Then, he showed it alongside his own key, which he had once lent to Aunt Natsuhi.`
`"...Normally, I should have left the Master's key for the police,`
` ......but he had ordered me to always protect the safety of the study, so I borrowed it for the time being."`
`".........I see...`
` Which means that Kinzo's study is the only safe location right now..."`
`"...It would appear that way.`
` ......I don't even want to think about being shut up all night in that room of peculiar smells,`
` but it appears we must accept that his room is safer than anywhere else right now."`
`"...............Grandfather locked himself up in that "safe room", but the culprit still brought him out and killed him.`
` ...We can't say for certain that it's truly safe."`
`"If we go with your theory, that Grandfather skillfully outlasted the receipt and then left the room of his own free will,`
` ...it still might have some worth as a place to barricade ourselves in..."`
`"......You're too optimistic, Aniki."`
`However, ......at the same time, I thought he brought up a pretty interesting point.`
`After all, this gives us a chance to question the enemy, the witch herself, about how the sealed door had been opened.`
`If we assume that the culprit used some technique to abduct Grandfather from his study...`
`...they would have to show us the same trick again if they wanted to assault us in the study.`
`......It's an opportunity to force the culprit to demonstrate that trick right before our eyes.`
`If they're a real witch, we would be forcing them to say Open Sesame and open the door by magic right in front of us.`
` ......But such a thing is probably impossible.`
`If you flip over the chessboard, you realize that the culprit is obviously just trying to act like they're a witch.`
`......If they really were a witch, all they'd have to do is appear in front of us and show off a spell colorful enough to silence all our doubts.`
`...Since they've avoided doing that, everything must be the work of a fake witch who wants us to think otherwise.`
`......Therefore, {i:a culprit who used a technique other than magic to defeat the locked room couldn't open the door before our eyes}.`
`"......Is Grandfather's room big enough to stuff eight people in?"`
`".........Yes.`
` There is a bed, a sofa, and blankets, so while it is not luxurious, it will be more than enough to spend the night.`
` There is also a sink, a bathroom, a refrigerator and a liquor cabinet."`
`"Whoa.`
` That's incredible.`
` ...But isn't that weird?`
` You're saying he built another house inside his house?`
` That's pretty cramped for the last house of someone like our grandfather, who bought a whole island and realized all of his dreams."`
`"........................`
` Yes, it is.`
` ......After some point in time, Father wouldn't trust any other place even inside the mansion."`
`".........We always sneered about how he shut himself up in there, and this time, we're the ones who are gonna shut ourselves up.`
` ...Ha!"`
`Jessica spat the words out.`
`"Jessica‐chan, ...it feels like you would rather go search for the culprit than stay shut up somewhere."`
`"...Of course, I don't think we'll be able to find them if we just start searching now.`
` ...In the end, we can't do anything but wait."`
`"Then it doesn't matter where we wait, does it?!`
` I won't run away or hide.`
` Why don't we just take it easy in the parlor, watching TV or something and waiting for the great {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama to appear?!"`
`"......It will be perfectly satisfactory for her not to appear.`
` There is no need for us to expose the culprit."`
`"Well said......`
` We shouldn't take too many risks before the police get here."`
`"Thank you, Doctor Nanjo.`
` .........I think we should move to Father's study.`
` ...Certainly, considering the possibility that Father was taken out of there, there's no guarantee of absolute safety."`
`"......However, just as Battler‐kun reasoned,`
` I also can't deny the possibility that Father left the study of his own accord and was attacked outside."`
`...That crazy theory had just been what I came up with to stop the argument.`
`However, just as Auntie Eva had said, even though that trick would work,`
` I can't begin to explain what motive could have made Grandfather do something so awkward to sneak out of his own study.`
`Plus, that trick of hiding under the bed and waiting for the receipt to be removed before escaping,`
` couldn't have been used unless Grandfather had "known that the receipt was wedged in the door".`
`Auntie Eva hadn't pointed out that last part,`
` ......but it's clear how absurd the theory was.`
`Then does that mean, that as Auntie Eva claimed, the door was sealed and it was a locked room?`
`Is it a doubtless fact that Aunt Natsuhi was the culprit, and that the room was a locked room...?`
`............If Auntie were here now, she would probably make that claim openly and do me the favor of blowing my strange theory away.`
`...But anyway.`
`I had to admit that a room with both a bed and a toilet, that all eight people could be shut up in,`
` ...and with only two keys, both of which were gathered here, had to be the safest place in the mansion right now...`
`At the very least, I figured this would be better than shutting ourselves up in the parlor again, and saying "nothing went wrong while we were in there before".`
`No, wait, ......were we safe only because we were shut up in the parlor?`
`{n}What if leaving that room and moving to an unexplored location is actually more dangerous...?`
`...Aah, no good, no good, no goddamn good at all...`
`{n}.........My flimsy head is about to break out in a fever.`
`...As I keep flipping over the chessboard, the real and the inverse keep switching with each other over and over, and I lose my ability to believe anything...`
`When it seems like the culprit is one of the 18, I want to believe in {f:5:Beatrice},`
` and once I start believing in {f:5:Beatrice}, I start wanting to find the culprit amid the 18.`
`...That keeps spinning around forever, and in the end, my thoughts haven't taken one step from where they started...`
`......How far back in the past was it that Kyrie‐san taught me this chessboard way of thinking...?`
`That concept of examining the situation by flipping it over and thinking from the enemy's side...`
` I get the feeling that I was so interested in this way of thinking at the time, that I let it guide the way I thought about everything.`
`......By the way, Kyrie‐san was Dad's coworker back then.`
`{n}...I hadn't dreamed that the day would come when she would be added to our family...`
`...Didn't Kyrie‐san...`
`...tell me something?`
`I get the feeling she once said that, while this chessboard thinking was one way to look at things, it wasn't all‐powerful by any means,`
` and in fact was actually bad to rely on too much...`
`"Chessboard thinking...`
`is my interpretation of something called game theory, which I read about in a book.`
` It's a very interesting subject, so you should try tackling it when you get into college, Battler‐kun."`
`"I really wanna try it!`
` If I could study that and perfect my chessboard thinking, it'd be like I could read into any opponent's moves—that'd be really fun!"`
`"But you can't believe in it blindly.`
` Game theory is a very deep and complicated subject.`
` Chessboard thinking is just my interpretation that skims the surface of game theory.`
` ......In order to thoroughly read your opponent's moves like you are imagining, you need to do a lot of study."`
`"Additionally, while chessboard theory is convenient and practical, it isn't perfect.`
` It has many weak points despite its convenience."`
`"......Weak points?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...Chessboard thinking is founded upon game theory.`
` And game theory is essentially math when you boil it down.`
` Do you know what the weak point of math is?`
` .........It's noise."`
`In math, when you write 1+1=2,`
` that equation will always be 1+1=2 no matter how many billions of years pass—nothing more, nothing less.`
`That's because there's absolutely no noise mixed in.`
`But, for example,`
` ......unlike math, the Japanese language has noise mixed in.`
`Kanji are a good example.`
` Old kanji and new kanji are slightly different,`
` which represents an introduction of noise created by change over the ages.`
`Isn't history the same?`
` ...There are dozens of policies that seem foolish in the modern era, but were meaningful at some point in the past.`
`Because the rules of chess are fixed, when a pair of experts are discussing one particular position,`
` it's possible that they could reach the same conclusion whether they're from a hundred years in the past or a hundred years in the future.`
`...However, if the rules of chess had gone through massive changes over time,`
` it's possible that the discussion about that same position would have changed as well.`
`"Precisely.`
` Events in the world of humans are naturally full of noise.`
` Aren't human emotions that way?`
` Even if the exact same thing occurs more than once, there's no guarantee that humans will always act in a predictable fashion."`
`"......The very fact that we're trying to read an opponent's actions by applying a mathematical theory to them...`
`means we must realize that there are already some limits and weak points to our theory.`
` ......To put it quick and easy, chessboard thinking is extremely weak against noise and fickleness, and even mistakes or incorrect knowledge."`
`...That's right.`
` Kyrie‐san definitely said that...`
`In the first place, chess is a game where both sides play by the same rules and fight with the same objective, namely victory.`
` This is why it is possible for both sides to predict the other's moves.`
`.........It's possible to read an opponent because you can always suppose that they will advance with the best moves they can find.`
`......But what if...`
`the opponent is fickle or a little tired, and makes a move that can hardly be called "the best"?`
`Or maybe, ...what if the game actually has special rules,`
` only the enemy knows them, and they can make use of something unknown to you?`
`In fact, what if the opponent actually has some goal other than victory?`
`Think from your enemy's perspective.`
`{n}That is the basis of chessboard thinking.`
`...Which means that...`
`...if you misunderstand your enemy, any and all answers that you draw from that process will be complete rubbish, and of no use at all...`
`Many times, I'd thought that by using chessboard thinking, I had gotten a glimpse into the person behind these crimes.`
`However, I don't know anything about the culprit.`
`{n}......Am I just playing in a labyrinth of thought?`
`.........If Kyrie‐san were here at a time like this......`
`she'd probably be able to notice something with her much, much sharper thinking ability......`
`......Jessica never warmed to the idea of moving into Grandfather's study.`
`But in the end, Aunt Natsuhi persisted and we decided to move there.`
`Everyone was already trapped by paranoia.`
`...Kumasawa‐san had prepared dinner once already, but after the incident involving George‐aniki's parents, the kitchen and the parlor had become temporarily devoid of people.`
`Someone said that it might have been poisoned at that time.`
`{n}...Because of that, we were unable to even touch the food that Kumasawa‐san had taken the trouble to make for us.`
`.........The manner in which the first six had been killed was still unknown, but there was a possibility that it was poison.`
`...And indeed, by this method, even a single person would be able to carry out the murder of six fully grown adults.`
`...Furthermore, this idea made it seem like there was only a single culprit, who was also afraid of Aunt Natsuhi's rifle, and this was very good for our emotional stability.`
`But the fatigue and hunger were even harsher than we had imagined.`
`......So, on Kumasawa‐san's suggestion, we all went along together to the kitchen,`
` and gathered some canned food, which would be hard to poison, to take in with us.`
`All of Kumasawa‐san's efforts to reward us with at least a nice dinner on this savage day regrettably came to nothing...`
`The food piled up on the serving cart looked just a little sad.`
`We all started climbing the stairs.`
` Aunt Natsuhi led the group, warily staring into the darkness with both eyes and the barrel of the gun.`
`When we arrived on the third floor, just as Aunt Natsuhi had warned us beforehand,`
` there was a mixture of a chemical smell and a sickly sweet aroma, a stench hanging in the air that felt like it was eating into our heads.`
`"......Yeah, this kind of stench probably would give you a headache if you were shut in with it for a whole night.`
` ...I know it's a little late, but I find myself siding with Jessica against going into Grandfather's study."`
`This exceptionally magnificent door felt like the source of the stench.`
`......So this was the door to the forbidden study, which had turned away all who visited it...`
`While Genji‐san was unlocking the door, Maria was staring at the door and the doorknob with great interest.`
`".........Uu.`
` ...What a door."`
`"It looks old and strict and like it'd stop any jokes cold—sure is a fitting door for Grandfather's study."`
`"......It contains a really strong power to ward off any spiritual menace.`
` .........{f:5:Beatrice} probably couldn't open this door."`
`"Oh...?`
` What does that mean?"`
`Maria pointed at the doorknob.`
`.........A scorpion crest—`
`no, a design like a magic circle arranged around a scorpion, was inscribed there.`
`...This design... ...That's right.`
`{n}Isn't this just like those keyholder charms that Maria gave Jessica and me yesterday...?`
`".........The fifth magic circle of Mars is a strong magic repellent.`
` Additionally, this magic circle was very diligently constructed, and is full of power.`
` ............To beings of magic like {f:5:Beatrice}, this magic circle is quite troublesome."`
`"Isn't that comforting.`
` Are you saying that we can even escape the grip of {f:5:Beatrice}'s evil hand in this room?`
` Our little witch here sure is reliable."`
`"......Then how did {f:5:Beatrice} take Grandfather out...?"`
`"............Just as Battler reasoned.`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice} can't go inside.`
` But she has magic, and she also has familiars.`
` Using those, she might have been able to force Grandfather to leave the study."`
`"Aah, I read that in a manga.`
` There was a scene where the vampires were frightened of crosses, so they couldn't get close,`
` but their familiars were fine, so they made their familiars attack."`
`"That scorpion keyholder‐like charm I gave to you yesterday also had the fifth magic circle of Mars on it.`
` The power dwelling within it was paltry, but it would have been enough to protect you until you left the island."`
`".........Although it sounds like you lost it, right?`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi..."`
`"......Scorpion keyholder charm?"`
`"Ah, ......aaah, umm...`
` The charm I gave you yesterday was something I got from Maria.`
` I heard that it would repel magic if you put it on your doorknob, ...and at the time I thought maybe it would be better if you had it..."`
`"......Is that so?`
` ...I thought it was an odd thing for you to be carrying around."`
`"............Aunt Natsuhi put that...`
`on her doorknob?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...Last night, after hearing about it from Jessica, I hung it from the doorknob on the inside of my door."`
`"Then, Aunt Natsuhi, you're really fortunate.`
` .........If you did that, {f:5:Beatrice} probably couldn't even lay one finger on you yesterday."`
`"...I think {f:5:Beatrice} must have been really annoyed.`
` ......Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi..."`
`...{f:5:Beatrice}, annoyed...?`
`{n}Couldn't lay one finger...?`
`Natsuhi thought back on that eerie graffiti she had seen that morning, like someone had been tearing at the outside of her door with blood‐soaked hands, ......and gasped in surprise.`
`Could it be,`
` .........that this witch who called herself {f:5:Beatrice},`
` ......had tried to enter through the door to her very own room...?`
`But the magic‐repelling charm had been hanging from the inside.`
`{n}...So she couldn't break through the door.`
` So she was annoyed.`
`{n}...So, she scratched at it...?`
`"Quit it, don't talk about that...`
` Witches don't exist.`
` The killer does.`
` And that's a human just like us."`
`"......And if you need proof, why don't we dice her up and see if her blood's red?`
` ......Damn it, .........damn it......`
` ......How could you...do that to Kanon‐kun........."`
`Click.`
` Genji unlocked the door.`
`The eight entered Kinzo's study...`
`Grandfather's study, .........I'd heard rumors about beforehand, so it didn't surprise me all that much.`
`He had done nothing more than fortify it thoroughly with his occult hobbies.`
`...If Grandfather's hobby had been chasing after pop idols, these walls might have been buried beneath idol posters.`
`Even if I didn't understand it, I did realize that this room was an amalgamation of all the things he enjoyed.`
`Even so, I couldn't help but remain dumbfounded by the smell of his creepy medicine and the sweet stench that seemed to melt my head...`
`When the door closed, it automatically made a clunk.`
`{n}...I see, this is the auto‐lock that's activated whenever the door is closed...`
`And there were only two keys which could open this door from the outside, both of which were in this room.`
` ......In other words, this room had become a "locked room".`
`.........The shutter, the receipt, the chain.`
`{n}......And now, the auto‐lock.`
`...This fourth door had been locked in the most magnificent fashion yet, constructing a locked room in a perfect form that none could argue with.`
`Just to make absolutely sure that the room was secure, we checked all over for ways in or out.`
`The windows were tightly locked.`
` That should have been enough, but just in case, we tried knocking all over the walls.`
`......After all, there had been whispers that there might be a hidden door in this room.`
`{n}...But we couldn't find anything suspicious.`
`Grandfather's study was very large.`
`{n}Even though we called it a study, it wasn't really a single room.`
`It could be divided up into four basic sections: a study section, a bedroom section, a toilet/bathroom section and a section for cooking that had a sink.`
`I see, this study does have enough in it to live in.`
`{n}...Now I could understand how Grandfather could live his whole life in this room without ever leaving.`
`It seemed that Grandfather wasn't in the habit of watching TV; there was no television in this room, nor even a radio.`
`......Until tomorrow morning, there would be nothing for us to do but pass the time listening to the sound of the rain.`
`Doctor Nanjo gazed at the chessboard that sat on the table in front of the sofa, and muttered...`
`It was apparently the partly finished chess match he'd been playing with Grandfather until yesterday.`
`......The black had the white pretty well cornered, and it looked like checkmate would be reached within a few moves—the end of the endgame.`
`Even though checkmate had almost been reached,`
` ......the endgame had been rushed,`
` ......and in the end, was never completed.`
`"......Kinzo‐san.`
` ...It seems...`
`......we weren't able to see this match through after all..."`
`".........Doctor Nanjo..."`
`"...I was Kinzo‐san's friend for a long time, ......but I never knew about more than half of him.`
` ...I believe that two Kinzos existed, a wise one...and one trapped by some madness..."`
`"............I never understood anything about him..."`
`"...Especially when it came to {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, it would seem like his personality changed..."`
`In the direction of Kumasawa‐san's upward gaze, a portrait of {f:5:Beatrice} could be seen.`
`It wasn't massive like the one hanging in the entrance hall, but small, made for this room.`
`Grandfather probably spent every day in this room, and so much of his time...`
`talking to the witch in that portrait.`
`......Who was {f:5:Beatrice} to Grandfather in the first place?`
`...By now, you couldn't just explain her away by saying she was a story made by the parents to frighten children away from wandering into the forest...`
`While eating the canned food we had brought from the kitchen, we talked together about who {f:5:Beatrice} was.`
`......Whether the culprit was {f:5:Beatrice} herself or someone pretending to be her,`
` whether they were a witch or a human—the lady in this portrait was strongly related to the basis and background of these crimes.`
`.........You couldn't talk about them without talking about her.`
`"......Oh yeah.`
` ...Mom, you picked up a letter from the culprit in Auntie Eva's room, right?"`
`"Yes...`
` We still haven't opened it, have we...`
` ......Let's open it and see."`
`...Aunt Natsuhi took out that Western‐style envelope.`
`Genji‐san pulled a letter opener out of a drawer in the study desk and handed it to her.`
`While watching her open it, George‐aniki grimaced slightly.`
`......After all, it was a letter left at the site where his parents had been murdered.`
`{n}...There was a good chance that its contents would say something unbearable to Aniki...`
`It seemed that Aunt Natsuhi also realized that.`
`{n}...So she glanced over the contents first without reading it aloud.`
`We were a little frightened that she might grimace after reading something shocking, but she just frowned unhappily.`
`"......What does...it say...?"`
`"...There is one unpleasant sentence.`
` ......It must be trying to provoke us."`
`Aunt Natsuhi, after deciding that the contents could be shown to the children, set it openly on the table.`
` Everyone stared at it at the same time.`
`"‘Praise my name’.`
` .........The hell?`
` ......So frickin' smug..."`
`".........It's probably {f:5:Beatrice} declaring herself the victor.`
` ............Damn it..."`
`".............................."`
`"I expect you were hoping for another weird magic circle to show up."`
`"......It wasn't a magic circle.`
` ......But it was just as I expected.`
` ...Kihihi."`
`"What could it mean......?`
` I wonder if she wants to tout her own existence..."`
`"That seems reasonable.`
` ......With this letter, we now know that the author of last night's letter is the culprit.`
` ......I think the identical envelope is more significant than what is written here."`
`"...............Without a doubt, this is the type of envelope and sealing wax that the Master used."`
`"...Ooooohh...`
` I don't know what's going on anymore......`
` This is the first time I've seen anything like this since I started working for the Ushiromiya family..."`
`"If we're to believe the letter last night, ......then {f:5:Beatrice} claims to be Grandfather's oldest confidante.`
` ......Grandfather often said the same thing in the past, right?"`
`I directed the question to Genji‐san and Kumasawa‐san, who nodded together.`
`"...So, the two of you knew more about this than anyone except Grandfather.`
` .........Could you tell us?"`
`".........For a long time, I made a point of ignoring this topic.`
` But now that it has come to this, I can no longer do so.`
` ...Genji, tell us everything you know."`
`"......................................."`
`Genji‐san didn't answer.`
` ...Did he remain silent despite his knowledge, or did he know nothing at all?`
`...Still, I had a good guess.`
` ...The ghost story of the witch {f:5:Beatrice} had long been deified among the servants.`
`......He had probably been very close to Grandfather, too, and his occult hobbies.`
`So there was a good chance that he'd been indoctrinated with even weirder things, and had increasingly come to deify the witch.`
`As Grandfather's most trusted servant, who had sworn loyalty to him,`
` he might be the most influenced by the witch illusion that Grandfather had created...`
`So there was only one reason for Genji‐san to remain silent.`
`......He could say it, but it would definitely cause a backlash, so it was better if he kept his mouth shut, and it wasn't like we would believe him anyway.`
` Something along those lines.`
`...Only a short while ago, Maria had been more than willing to speak bluntly and unrestrainedly, and that had earned her a scuffle with Jessica.`
`It was natural for Genji‐san to keep his silence...`
`"......Was she Father's...`
`...mistress,`
` perhaps?"`
`His mistress.`
` ......That could be possible.`
`For ordinary poor people, polygamy isn't only viewed negatively from a moral perspective.`
` It is also an unmaintainable financial situation.`
`......But that isn't the case for the very rich.`
`It's possible for them to have another lover in addition to their real wife.`
`{n}...We can't deny the possibility that Grandfather had another woman in his life besides Grandmother.`
`"Maybe...`
` When Grandmother was alive, it seems she strongly suspected it.`
` That he was cheating on her.`
` ......I'd always thought she was just referring to the witch in Grandfather's head, but..."`
`"...This is getting really interesting.`
` ......You told me, didn't you, Genji‐san?`
` You said {f:5:Beatrice} has been working for Grandfather since before the mansion was finished."`
`"I have heard that the construction of the mansion was completed in 1952."`
`"That would mean that this person called {f:5:Beatrice} had been in a relationship with Grandfather for over thirty years..."`
`"Could that mistress of thirty years ago...or maybe a relative or hidden child of that person...hold some kind of grudge and be planning revenge?`
` ...Ihihi, I see, this is starting to sound just like your standard Western mansion mystery."`
`"............It's a filthy topic, but the easiest line of reasoning to accept.`
` ...Well, Genji?"`
`"..............................`
` ...............The Master surely had feelings of deep love for her.`
` There can be no mistake that he cared for her more than his late wife."`
`"......Who is this person called {f:5:Beatrice}?!`
` And what is she doing now?!"`
`"..................`
` ......I have heard that she passed away before the mansion was completed."`
`"She's already dead...?"`
`"......Yes.`
` ......The Master mourned for her most grievously,`
` .........and he devoted himself to the art of black magic as a means to revive {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"......The Master loved {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama from the bottom of his heart.`
` ...It was that madness which drove him to do all that you see here."`
`As Genji‐san said this, he spread his arms, ......as though asking us to look at this room, filled with the signs of Grandfather's madness.`
`...We were all at a loss for words.`
`Before this, his black magic hobby was nothing other than creepy, and we had found it impossible to understand what drove him to devote himself to it.`
`...Nobody had tried to understand Kinzo, dismissing him as an "eccentric" who had restored the Ushiromiya family amidst his madness...`
`All that had been on Grandfather's mind was the loss of the woman he loved,`
` ......and the sorrow of being unable to give up on her.`
`......Just a few moments ago, this room had seemed creepy,`
` ...but in that instant, everything about it started making sense.`
`The creepy books,`
` the magic circles,`
` the medicine,`
` ...all of it.`
`......All just because he wanted to revive once more the visage of a single woman, who had left this world thirty long years ago...`
`"............The Master only told me about {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's story once, when he was very drunk.`
` .........Although I have forgotten the details.`
` ......It was...`
`a deep, deep love, enough to make a woman like me jealous."`
`"......When Kinzo‐san succeeded the headship of the Ushiromiya family,`
` ...his marriage to his late wife was decided by the few surviving elders of the family."`
`"...So, he married a woman who would benefit the Ushiromiya family,`
` ......because he was forced to?"`
`"......That is correct.`
` ......Kinzo‐san was installed as the head who would revive the family, and had to bear all of that heavy responsibility.`
` .........I...do not pretend to know the details of when or where Kinzo‐san first met {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"............It'd be rude to say any more than that."`
`That was when Grandfather truly fell in love for the first time...`
`How deep that affection must have been.`
`{n}...It was easy to tell just by looking around us.`
`......This room was covered with piles upon piles of things having to do with black magic.`
`{n}And Grandfather had spent day after long day shut in here, immersed in his research and isolated from the outside world, never taking a single day off.`
`......You couldn't help but realize how deep Grandfather's love for {f:5:Beatrice} was...`
`".....................`
` ......I......had it all wrong, Genji‐san."`
`"...............What might that be?"`
`"I, ......I've always thought that...maybe you servants believed blindly in the witch because you were influenced by Grandfather's creepy black magic hobby.`
` ......But that's not how it was..."`
`Perhaps they had been acting as though at least {f:5:Beatrice}'s soul had been restored,`
` ......and existed inside this mansion,`
` ......in order to soothe Grandfather's heart...`
`With closed eyes, and an expression as though he was remembering something from the distant past,`
` ......Genji maintained his silence.`
`............He probably felt that to confess that would be to betray his one and only master in the most serious way, even though that person was already dead.`
`......{f:5:Beatrice} has revived as a witch, and she is in the mansion even now.`
`......That was his mantra,`
` what he had believed,`
` ...what he had made others believe.`
`{n}.........And Genji would take that with him to the grave.`
`This might have been the last service he could offer his master.`
`The legend of the witch, the mysterious tale of Rokkenjima that was still whispered of amongst the servants.`
`......Its true nature was...`
`...a sad lie.`
` ...No, an act of kindness, towards Grandfather, who had lost the person he loved above all else.`
`"..................`
` ......I remember denying the witch's existence in front of Father on multiple occasions.`
` .........Now I finally understand how much that must have wounded him..."`
`"......Right now, I can understand very well.`
` .........If I thought that I could revive Shannon using black magic,`
` ......I'd immediately become the next owner of this room and start researching..."`
`"..............................Aniki."`
`Another strand of tears dripped from George's eyes.`
`{n}......Maybe it was infectious; tears rose to Jessica's eyes too, and she sniffled...`
`"............{f:5:Beatrice} told me.`
` .........Very soon, she'll be able to revive.`
` We'll be able to meet up."`
`― Very soon, the door to the Golden Land will be opened.`
`In that promised land that glitters gold, she'll resurrect all the dead people's souls, and revive the love they possessed as well.`
`......And I will sleep, in a world of peacefulness, for evermore.`
`"......Did she say that?`
` The {f:5:Beatrice} who gave you the letter?"`
`"...............You don't believe, do you?`
` ......Kihihihi."`
`"......If only Grandfather were here.`
` I'm sure he'd be happy.`
` I'm sure he'd be jumping for joy now that {f:5:Beatrice} is about to be revived..."`
`"...In that case, I'll believe.`
` ...If spending half of his life on research is what brought life back to Grandfather, and if believing that the soul of the woman he loved had been resurrected is what enabled him to live to a ripe old age, ...I'll believe too."`
`".........Battler........................"`
`"...When love for a single woman is persistent over a long time,`
` ......it is shared by those around you and becomes the truth."`
`".........Maybe you could say they're just being considerate.`
` .........But right here, now, ...I'd like to call that magic."`
`"............It isn't consideration.`
` .........It really is...magic.`
` ...She's a witch.`
` ......Kihihihihihi.`
` It looks like nobody can see {f:5:Beatrice} after all..."`
`Some time passed.`
` As we listened to the sound of the rain,`
` ......we considered what kind of love and madness must have possessed the owner of this room as he spent half of his life here...`
`".........If you ask me as a woman, then while I'd like to understand Father's feelings of true love,`
` ......it does leave Mother in an awkward position."`
`"Haha, I agree.`
` Cheating is cheating.`
` No way to make it pretty..."`
`"......That's also true.`
` Poor Grandmother."`
`"So, ......is there any story about a child between {f:5:Beatrice} and Grandfather...?"`
`The keyword "{f:5:Beatrice}" has been hidden in every corner of this case.`
`So it's natural to suspect any relative of {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`"No.`
` .........I have not heard of anything like that."`
`"......If there had been one, I'm sure he would have given them all of his affection, in memory of his beloved.`
` ...Since that didn't happen, and he immersed himself in black magic, maybe we should assume that there was no such child."`
`"..................Come to think of it, this reminds me of a rumor I heard.`
` ...You know it, right?`
` You know that story about how Grandfather heavily supported a welfare institute called the Gospel House?"`
`"...Enough of that.`
` That is nothing more than slander which would desecrate Father."`
`"Tell us, Aunt Natsuhi.`
` ...Don't you agree that we shouldn't hide things from each other?"`
`"...............It's a worthless story.`
` Father heavily supported that institute, and opened up servant employment positions for them within this house as part of their social studies.`
` ...Some foolish people started spreading rumors that Father had foul motivations—that is all."`
`"At one point, there was a rumor that he was collecting sacrifices for his black magic...`
` And since he was actually doing weird experiments and rituals in this room all the time, I half believed it myself..."`
`"......And who are these servants who came from the Gospel House?"`
`"............There are several, but during the family conference, only Shannon and Kanon were scheduled to be here."`
`To resurrect {f:5:Beatrice}, he had summoned servants from a welfare institute......as sacrifices...?`
`"After all, everyone that Grandfather selected as a servant was young, always about the same age as Shannon or Kanon‐kun.`
` ...I was sure that Grandfather had some weird inclinations."`
`"Jessica!`
` Control your words."`
`When Aunt Natsuhi scolded her, the atmosphere instantly went sour and everyone fell quiet.`
`...However, something was tugging at the back of my mind.`
`Sacrifices...`
` Sacrifices...`
` .........Sacrifices brought over from the Gospel House...`
`......What is it?`
` Freaky words like "sacrifices" don't pop up often.`
`...Yet I've seen or heard that word somewhere recently.`
`{n}.........Some part of my memory is tugging at me.`
`......Come on, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}What do you know...?`
`I had arrived in front of the portrait of {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`It wasn't as vast as the one in the entrance hall,`
` but that portrait, which he must have had drawn by some famous painter, was still just as intimidating in this smaller size.`
`...Below it, just like in the entrance hall, was the epitaph said to point out the place where the gold was hidden......`
`"..................ah...`
`...............!`
` Sacrifices...`
`......"`
`"Wh‐what the hell, Battler?`
` You're creeping me out..."`
`".........Sacrifice...`
`the six.`
` ............ah...`
`......AAAAAAAAaaaaaaaahh!!!"`
`Both of my eyes opened as wide as plates...`
`{n}......Right there, everything had been predicted since the very beginning......!`
`Everyone crowded around.`
`{n}And the same expression of terror filled every face...!`
`Yes.`
` It was written in the epitaph.`
`"On the first twilight, sacrifice the six chosen by the key."`
`"Ah, ......aaahh, there's no doubt.`
` Six people died in the beginning!`
` And even on the shutter where the magic circle was drawn, no, where the Hebrew was written, it mentioned the offering of sacrifices...!!"`
`"......Uu.`
` ...I've been saying that from the beginning."`
`That's right, Maria had said it at the very beginning!`
`{n}Right after we found the six bodies, when Maria was in the parlor watching TV, she had said it!`
`― ............Uu.`
` Killer's not human.`
` {i:Just the sacrifices chosen by the key.}`
`"This has nothing to do with the location of the hidden gold!!`
` It's black magic or something, the instructions for a resurrection ritual!`
` If I remember right, this epitaph requires a large number of "deaths"!"`
`"...It, it sure does.`
` Even reading through it quickly, there'd be 6+2+5...`
`...13 people who have to die...!"`
`"...How many people are normally on this island?!"`
`"It, ...it varies depending on the shifts for the servants, but there's Father, my husband, me and Jessica.`
` And two or three servants.`
` ...Today and yesterday, there were five of them, but there aren't normally that many."`
`"Which means that normally,`
` ......there wouldn't be enough sacrifices to carry out this "ritual".`
` ......No, wait.`
` ......There's that rumor that Grandfather was collecting servants from the Gospel House to be used as sacrifices in some creepy ritual..."`
`"So, what?!`
` He increased the number of servants to increase the number of sacrifices, ......and waited for the annual family conference when even more people would gather...`
` ...Isn't now the only time of the year that this ritual could be held?!"`
`When Jessica screamed this, Maria broke out in that creepy laugh, looking truly pleased.`
`"...............Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` ...Aren't there some people who make bets to test their fate?"`
`Like throwing a sandal and saying that if it lands right side up, tomorrow will be sunny.`
`{n}...Or saying that tomorrow will be a good day if a coin lands on heads.`
`......There are many little superstitions like that.`
`If you're fed up at how nothing is going right for you, and you happen to roll some dice and get three sixes, it would probably make you want to believe that it's a sign of some miracle.`
`...When flipping a sandal, you have at worst a fifty percent chance.`
`{n}Even if you get it right side up, it's not worth much.`
`...But if you carelessly roll three dice and they all come up six, you might think that's a small miracle.`
`".........Sorcery works the same way.`
` ...You keep on praying earnestly, hoping for that impossibly unlikely outcome.`
` ......Then, when that impossible result shows itself, the feelings from all those stored up prayers are made incarnate through magic."`
`"............The sorcery that Grandfather was trying to perform was probably like that.`
` The key randomly selected sacrifices in a lottery.`
` So to reduce the chance that he himself was selected, he chose the day with the greatest number of people on the island to carry out the ritual..."`
`"How ridiculous!!`
` Are you saying that all these incidents were part of the process of some questionable magic ritual?!"`
`Natsuhi yelled.`
`......She couldn't stop thinking fearfully about how she might have been protected just because of the scorpion charm.`
`.........If I hadn't received that charm from Jessica and hung it from my doorknob,`
` ......would I have been killed, been one of those six?!`
`And the strangest part is...even though I hung the charm from the inside of my door, they couldn't get through the door.`
`......The killer had noticed the charm from outside the door, and had given up trying to open the door.`
`......A human couldn't have perceived that.`
`The charm meant to stop someone that was not human...had done just that...!!`
` Impossible, impossible, impossible!!!`
`"However, Natsuhi‐san...`
` Look, ......the epitaph traces the events that followed..."`
`"O‐on the second twilight, those who remain shall tear apart the two who are close...`
` ...Could this be talking about Eva‐sama and Hideyoshi‐sama...?"`
`".........P‐painful as it may be, ...we must reach that conclusion.`
` ...And after the culprit killed them, they left the words from "the third twilight" in a letter there."`
`"Th‐that's right...`
` After carrying out the second twilight, they left the third twilight in that place.`
` ...The third twilight is...just like Aunt Natsuhi just read...!!"`
`"On the third twilight, those who remain shall praise my noble name."`
`Aaaaaaaaaahhh... Now I read it, it just keeps going on, doesn't it?`
`"On the fourth twilight, gouge the head and kill."`
`Gouge the head and kill.`
`......George‐aniki's parents were killed with the "demon's icepicks" gouged into their heads.`
`...But if that counted as the second twilight,`
` ......someone else must be gouged in the head...`
`"......That's Grandfather...`
` He had been burned in the incinerator, and our eyes were so drawn to that part that we didn't notice,`
` ......but Grandfather's forehead,`
` ...no, his head had been gouged."`
`"Grandfather is......the victim of the fourth twilight?`
` Th‐...then, Kanon‐kun...!"`
`"...‘On the fifth twilight, gouge the chest and kill’.`
` ......We thought that Kanon‐kun's case was an unexpected encounter with the culprit, .........but that's wrong.`
` They had been planning on luring someone out alone and driving something through their chest from the beginning..."`
`"............If the culprit has followed the epitaph this far...`
`...does that mean that three people still have to die...?!"`
`"On the sixth twilight, gouge the stomach and kill."`
`"On the seventh twilight, gouge the knee and kill."`
`"On the eighth twilight, gouge the leg and kill."`
`"......Y‐......yes,`
` ...you could read it that way...`
` ......hiiiii..."`
`"Well, I wonder about that...`
` .........After those three die, it reaches the ninth twilight.`
` Take a look..."`
`"On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive."`
`"We are...all going to be killed by {f:5:Beatrice}......"`
`".........I don't get it.`
` Doesn't that mean that everyone will die no matter how many people there are?`
` ......What was Grandfather's goal?`
` Doesn't this mean that this ritual would kill Grandfather himself no matter what...?!"`
`"...............It doesn't matter that no one's left alive.`
` ......On the tenth twilight, we finally arrive at the Golden Land."`
`"On the tenth twilight, the journey ends, and you shall reach the Home of the Gold."`
`"The witch shall praise the wise, and bestow four treasures."`
`"......Grandfather wasn't afraid of something like death.`
` .........Look at the second and third of the four treasures."`
`"............‘One resurrects all the dead people's souls.`
` One even revives all the love they possessed.’`
` ......So Grandfather believed that he would eventually be revived, even if he died partway through this ritual...?"`
`"Ridiculous, that's insane!!`
` When you die, it's over, right?!`
` The dead don't come back to life.`
` That's a miracle that humanity has been chasing after for thousands of years and still hasn't accomplished!`
` So it's gotta be something like this, right?`
` Something like, you can revive and meet them in the world after death?!"`
`"......If what you say is right, ......would that mean...`
`Grandfather, whose remaining life is slim and who is insane because of love, is committing suicide,`
` no, ...a massive forced group suicide...?!"`
`"...................................."`
`"......Genji.`
` ...Can that possibility be considered...?!"`
`"............I do not know.`
` ...The Master is a man who sometimes has the wisdom to see a thousand years into the future.`
` However, there are times when that appears to be nothing more than madness to commoners such as myself..."`
`"What, does that mean "yes"?!`
` What do you say, Kumasawa‐san?!"`
`"I, I don't know anything...!`
` No, you can be sure of that...`
` Do you think I would be on this island today if I did know?`
` I would have faked an illness or done whatever it took to get the day off, good gracious, yes!!"`
`"What about your opinion, Doctor Nanjo—you've been Grandfather's friend for many years..."`
`".........I, I feel the same as Genji‐san.`
` ...Kinzo‐san was a man who far surpassed ordinary people.`
` I've even felt a sort of inhuman power from him at times."`
`".........Not even I.........understand what Kinzo‐san was thinking when he wrote that epitaph...!"`
`"...All we can say......is that even if the person who created this outline was Father, the one carrying it out is a different person."`
`"That's right.`
` .........At the very least, there's another culprit who attacked Grandfather and Kanon‐kun.`
` Furthermore, that person is still continuing the crimes just as the epitaph says...!"`
`"...The letter in the beginning that we didn't think deeply about...`
` What was it that was written there?"`
`We thought back to the recitation of the letter last night...`
`{f:5:Beatrice} had proclaimed something inside the letter.`
`{n}She had proclaimed that, in accordance with her contract with Kinzo, she would collect everything of the Ushiromiya family as interest.`
`But then she had also revealed a special clause.`
`If someone discovered the location of the gold Grandfather had hidden, that right would be lost.`
`At the time that the letter had been read, Grandfather was still alive.`
`{n}...But at that time, it had already been sealed with wax by the Head's Ring.`
`...Which meant that Grandfather had handed the ring over to {f:5:Beatrice} while he was still alive.`
`.........If you think about that straightforwardly,`
` we should probably take that to mean that {f:5:Beatrice} is carrying out that strange contract, and Grandfather is securing her that right.`
`......Simply put, it was the same as saying that Grandfather knew of and approved of the contents of that letter.`
`In other words, it's as though it was a joint message from {f:5:Beatrice} and Grandfather...`
`telling us that {f:5:Beatrice} will start collecting interest if we don't solve the riddle.`
`......In short, Grandfather and {f:5:Beatrice} were telling us to solve the epitaph's riddle.`
` And if we couldn't, they were saying they would kill us all, following the procedure in the epitaph.`
`What meaning is there to that?`
` What do they want?!`
`{n}I don't have a clue what it means!`
`".....................`
` .........Look, another letter from {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......Huh?`
` What did you say?"`
`Maria was pointing at the top of the table, where the canned food that everyone had been eating just now still lay.`
`A Western‐style envelope was sitting there, ......but so what?`
`"......What?!"`
`Aunt Natsuhi let out a hysterical cry, looking between her own hand and the table.`
`......Because the envelope that she had just opened was still grasped in her hand.`
`......And despite that, there's an envelope on the table...?!`
`"Wh‐......what is this?!?!`
` What's going on, Maria!!`
` Where did that envelope come from?!"`
`"......Just now, I looked and it was lying there.`
` Uu."`
`"I, ......I don't know anything, anything!!"`
`"This isn't funny, there's only the eight of us here!!`
` There's no way some ninth person snuck in!!`
` There wasn't enough time during the few seconds that we gathered around the portrait, right?!"`
`"Get back, all of you!!!`
` Back against the wall!!"`
`Aunt Natsuhi was pointing the rifle at Genji and the others, bellowing at them...!`
`Genji‐san was overpowered, his face looking like he didn't have a clue what was going on...`
`Of course, I felt the same, ......but a few moments late, I reached the same conclusion Aunt Natsuhi had.`
`Until just a few seconds ago, there was no letter like this on the table...!`
` And nobody had entered this room!`
` That means someone among us had placed it there during the few seconds when everyone was looking away, preoccupied with the portrait...!!`
`"Battler‐kun, open that envelope and read what's inside!"`
`"S‐sure!!"`
`I picked up the envelope.`
` ......It was still sealed with wax.`
`Even without disturbing its contents, I realized that this was an unopened envelope, an unknown envelope!`
`Without relying on a letter opener, I violently tore it open and pulled out the letter inside.`
`The contents were as follows.`
`{e:070:― Are you enjoying the riddle of Kinzo‐sama's epitaph?`
`As you are all probably aware, you have very little time remaining.`
`Please abandon any naive hopes of escaping after the storm passes.`
`This game can only end with my victory or yours.`
`When time runs out, I will win by default.`
` There will be no ties.`
`Make sure that you do not misunderstand your current situation.}`
`"That's what it says......"`
`".........It isn't clear who put this letter there.`
` However, I have been able to narrow down the list of suspects.`
` It's all of {i:you}!!"`
`"......M‐Madam...`
` That's just......too horrible......"`
`"Just before I moved towards the portrait, I set a can of food down here.`
` At that time, there definitely wasn't anything as strange as this letter there!!"`
`"And at that time, Jessica, George‐kun and Battler‐kun were already in front of the portrait!!`
` And they didn't leave the spot in front of the portrait until the letter appeared!`
` So the person who set that letter down is one of you four!!!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} is one of you!!!"`
`".........Uu.`
` We aren't {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice} "exists"!"`
`"Silence!!!`
` I don't know whether I should suspect one of you or all of you.`
` ...But without a doubt, at least one among you is the culprit!!!"`
`"......Th‐...that's right.`
` There can't be a 19th person...!`
` There's no way witches exist!!`
` Even when Kanon‐kun was killed,`
` ......yeah, that could be explained if Kumasawa‐san was the one who did it!!"`
`"The truth is that Kumasawa‐san entered the boiler room with Kanon‐kun and killed him!`
` And then she lied, saying he had already fallen when she got there!!"`
`"Y‐you're making a mistake, Milady...!!`
` Why would I do something like that...?!!"`
`"...I don't have the slightest idea how my parents were killed in that locked room.`
` But when they were killed, everyone except for the servants had an alibi."`
`"......The only ones who didn't were the servants...`
` But, ...is it really correct to suspect them...?!"`
`"......W‐...well, now that you mention it, they do have no alibi for any of the cases, but...`
` .........nghh!!"`
`Should we really be so quick to make that judgment?!`
`{n}But this time...in this room, in this place, in this moment...in this minimally small bit of time and space, it's obvious.`
`Only one of the four of them could have set the letter there in our blind spot...!!`
`{n}We can't tell who put it there, but it's obvious that one of the four did it...!!`
`"...Na‐......Natsuhi‐san.`
` Please, calm yourself...`
` A lot has happened today!`
` I understand the condition your heart is in right now...!"`
`"Doctor Nanjo, it truly pains me to call you suspicious...!`
` However, as Father's personal doctor—and his closest friend!—you have been by his side for many years."`
`"You might know about {f:5:Beatrice} as well.`
` Could you be hiding some kind of old personal connection of his?!"`
`"Of course not...!!`
` Calm yourself...!"`
`It was pitiful to watch Doctor Nanjo frantically pleading his innocence.`
`{n}It was probably a normal reaction that anyone would give if they were suspected.`
`Kumasawa was the same.`
` Since Jessica had started suspecting her in the murder of Kanon, she was now totally flustered.`
`That was why Genji's still‐calm appearance looked so bold.`
`Aunt Natsuhi pointed the barrel of the gun.`
`"............Genji.`
` You were Father's number one subordinate.`
` ...Was {f:5:Beatrice} a fantasy you showed to Father, with you as the performer?!"`
`".........If by suspecting me, you recognize me as the Master's greatest servant,`
` ......then it is a great honor to me, regardless of the circumstances.`
` .........However, I am not the one who put the letter there."`
`"Do you expect me to just accept that?!!`
` You must be the ringleader!`
` Maybe Kumasawa and Doctor Nanjo are your accomplices!!`
` .........And you too, Maria‐chan."`
`Not content to doubt just the adults, Aunt Natsuhi pointed the gun relentlessly at Maria too.`
`But Maria acted as though nothing had happened.`
`.........Or maybe she thought she would be fine even if she was shot.`
`"Maria‐chan.`
` ...By this point, we can no longer remove someone from suspicion just because they are young.`
` So for the last time, let me ask the question that everyone's brought to you since last night!"`
`"...Yesterday, who was the {f:5:Beatrice} that handed you the letter?!!"`
`"..................Uu."`
`"......Maria, don't try to fool us!!`
` Make it clear!`
` Who the hell gave you that letter?!!"`
`"...Kihihihihihi.`
` ...How many times do I have to tell you?`
` It's {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` The thousand‐year‐old Golden Witch."`
`"............If you want to know what she looks like, just turn around.`
` ...See, she's right there.`
` {f:5:Beatrice} is.`
` ......Kihhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!"`
`"You, you think this is a game, you little bitch?!?!!!!!!!!!!!!"`
`"Stop it, Jessica!`
` Maria, too.`
` Don't you understand the situation?!`
` What are you hoping to gain by saying stuff like that?!`
` Stop stirring each other up pointlessly!"`
`"......I don't understand.`
` ...Who do you people want to be the culprit?"`
`"You only believe in {f:5:Beatrice} when you don't want to doubt one of your own,`
` ......and when you're trying to settle a grudge because someone who's close to you has been killed, only then do you want to believe in a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} culprit who you can attack with violence, and deny {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"............That's why you can't {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} her.`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice} "exists".`
` You all can't {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} her!"`
`"Silence!!!`
` I don't want to label you as the culprit, but there is no longer any doubt that you enjoy making this situation unpleasant, serving the interests of the enemy!!"`
`"......Kihihihihihihihi.`
` ...Then what will you do?`
` Shoot me?`
` I don't mind.`
` Very soon, the door to the Golden Land will be opened.`
` Then all the dead will be resurrected.`
` ......Right now, death is nothing to be afraid of.`
` ......Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!"`
`"M‐Mom, she really is suspicious!!`
` We can't stay with her!!"`
`"But Aunt Natsuhi, please, calm down...!`
` There's no reason to shoot Maria‐chan!`
` Please remain composed...!"`
`"The letter was meant to provoke us, but it's nothing to be afraid of!`
` Even the culprit is scared—scared of tomorrow.`
` Scared of the police!`
` Right now, this island is free from the reach of the law, but that's only because it's isolated by this typhoon!`
` Once the typhoon passes, the law will return!`
` So you mustn't shoot...!!"`
`"...How can you stay so calm, George nii‐san?!!`
` One of these four is the culprit!`
` No, maybe all four of them are working together!`
` How can you stay so calm when one of these four might be the culprit who killed your parents?!!"`
`"Even I have the desire to find the culprit and kill them...!`
` But that would be simple barbarism.`
` I will leave the judgment of crimes to the law!`
` So no matter how suspicious they are, you mustn't pull that trigger!!"`
`"I, I feel the same as George‐aniki...`
` Aunt Natsuhi.`
` Get ahold of yourself for a second...`
` Anyway, it'd be bad to shoot, ihihi...!`
` In times like this, I hear you should tilt your head back and say "Stay cool" three times..."`
`"...............Let me make this clear.`
` Witches don't exist!`
` Not on Rokkenjima, not in the Ushiromiya mansion!"`
`"I declare it as Ushiromiya Natsuhi, representative of the Ushiromiya family!!`
` There's no witch here!`
` I won't accept {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` No matter what you're planning, I won't let you lay one finger on my daughter or the rest of them!!!`
` That's my duty as a mother and as representative to the family!!"`
`Those words, ......were the final words of farewell that settled everything.`
`...To protect her daughter, Aunt Natsuhi would regard any suspicious person as an enemy.`
`......The only reason George‐aniki and I were standing on this side was because, by coincidence, we had a clear alibi regarding the letter.`
`If I hadn't approached the portrait,`
` ......I too may have been at the other end of that gun barrel, treated like a criminal...`
`......But even though part of me thought that,`
` ...part of me was thinking that chasing all of the suspicious people from this room would finally guarantee our safety...`
`Genji‐san, Kumasawa‐san, and Doctor Nanjo—all of them were on Grandfather's side.`
`{n}You could even say that Maria was on Grandfather's side, since she had a blind belief in {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......That's right, they're all suspicious.`
`But is this really alright...?!`
`{n}Is it really alright for us to fight back against the lawlessness of the witch by throwing out all the suspicious ones without due process...?!`
`Aunt Natsuhi didn't tell them to leave with her own words.`
`......But with wordless pressure, she was inducing them to say that themselves.`
`......So, if Doctor Nanjo hadn't said those words, this cold silence would surely have continued forever.`
`"............Calm yourself, Natsuhi‐san.`
` .........But I understand your feelings well.`
` I myself feel like there's something wrong with my head after all of these strange, repeated incidents...`
` So I understand well why you want to suspect us..."`
`"..................If you really have nothing to do with this, ...I would think that what I am doing is beyond rude.`
` .........However, ...please understand, just this once."`
`".........I understand.`
` ...Let's leave the room.`
` .........What do you say, Genji‐san?`
` ...Shall we return to the parlor and continue our chess game?"`
`"........................If that is what you wish, ......by all means."`
`"......I, ......I don't want to...!`
` I mean, that means we'll have to leave this room knowing that the wolf is among us...!`
` I don't want to, Madam, please forgive me, hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii......!"`
`What Kumasawa‐san was trying to say made total sense.`
`{n}If she was innocent, then she was being ejected into dangerous territory along with the culprit.`
`......In the current situation, pressing her to leave this room along with the suspects was almost exactly the same as letting her get killed...`
`However, Kumasawa‐san really was suspicious just for being the first one to discover that Kanon‐kun had been murdered.`
`...At that time, everyone except Kumasawa‐san had an alibi.`
`......As long as the use of some trick or the existence of some 19th person could not be established, Kumasawa‐san was one of the most likely suspects by far.`
`I didn't want to believe it.`
` However, Aunt Natsuhi and the rest of us were in such a difficult situation that we couldn't help doubting any of them, Kumasawa‐san included...`
`So we didn't say anything to stop Aunt Natsuhi from trying to oppressively chase them from the room.`
` ......We had stopped her from shooting, but when it came to exiling them from the room, we were passively agreeing...!`
`Maria spoke to the still‐fretful Kumasawa‐san.`
`"............You'll be alright.`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice} is kind to those who respect her.`
` ...You believe that {f:5:Beatrice} "exists"."`
`"...So I'm sure you'll be fine.`
` ......I'm going to watch TV in the parlor.`
` Let's watch it together.`
` ...This place has no TV and it's boring.`
` ............Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi."`
`It looked like Kumasawa found Maria's roguish laugh very frightening...`
`However, the three other people had agreed to leave the room.`
`{n}Kumasawa couldn't fight the flow, and had to agree, crying as she left the room...`
`"...Well then, Natsuhi‐san.`
` I shall leave you for tonight.`
` ......Let us meet again tomorrow."`
`"......Yes.`
` Please understand, at least for tonight.`
` When the police come, I promise to apologize to you all for my rudeness."`
`"...You may play chess, but do it in a safe place if you can.`
` ...Genji, I leave it to you."`
`".........Certainly."`
`"...Ho......hohoho...`
` It can't be helped, can it...`
` They always say that the most frightening bears are those with their cubs."`
`"......Genji, Kumasawa, my sincere apologies.`
` ......Let us meet again tomorrow.`
` ............Maria‐chan too.`
` ...Please forgive your cold aunt."`
`"Uu.`
` I forgive.`
` Uu!"`
`"Madam, the keys to this room.`
` ......I will hand both over to you."`
`Genji‐san pulled the two golden keys from his pocket and handed them to Aunt Natsuhi...`
`"...And I will also hand over my bundle of keys to the inside of the mansion."`
`He took out a bundle of about ten keys of various shapes, and handed it over.`
`.........To the servants, those keys were probably the proof of their position.`
`{n}Being placed in charge of those keys meant that they were trusted, relied upon.`
`......Being forced to return them...meant that they had lost that trust.`
`...Thinking about it this way, ......there could have been no greater humiliation for Genji‐san, who had served here for all these years.`
`......However, his usual indifferent expression remained on his face.`
`"......Genji.`
` ......I had planned that, after Father passed away, I would reward you for your many years of hard work and allow you to retire.`
` .........And yet, I am treating you like this...`
` ...It makes me feel ashamed from the bottom of my heart............"`
`"I have already received the Master's favor.`
` ......Everything I have done until today has been in repayment for that.`
` .........Please, do not worry over it."`
`"......Well, then, ...shall we, everyone?`
` ...Good night to you all."`
`"Uu.`
` Night‐night.`
` Battler too, night‐night, uu!"`
`"......Ah, ......Maria.`
` Wait a sec."`
`Guilt made me call Maria back.`
`...I groped around in my pocket, ......and took out that scorpion keyholder.`
`"............This repels magic, right?`
` ...Keep it on you."`
`"Uu...?`
` Didn't you say you dropped it......"`
`"...Back then, I was kinda pissed off, and I was just bluffing that I'd lost it.`
` ......There's no way I'd lose your precious charm."`
`"........................"`
`Maria silently took the charm.`
`{n}......I was unable to say anything after that...`
`"............Well then, everyone, good night to you......"`
`Unable to respond, ......we watched them leave, our expressions completely tired out.`
`......And until the door closed and we heard the auto‐lock, we were unable to even draw our next breath...`
`Then, when I was finally allowed to take a breath.`
`{n}...I noticed that {f:5:Beatrice}'s letter, which I had been gripping the whole time and which was soaked with my sweat, actually had two sheets.`
`...The paper had been tightly stuck together, so I had mistakenly thought that there was only one.`
`There was nothing written on the second sheet.`
`{n}......The thing drawn there was a magic circle, written with a red ink like blood.`
`.........Just like how every magic circle up until then had been different, this magic circle was one that I had never laid eyes on.`
`Inside the circle, a large triangle and a small triangle were fit together in a simple design.`
`But just as before, there was writing in Hebrew, and it seemed clear that it held some kind of meaning.`
`I wanted to know what that could be, ...but we had just chased Maria, the only person who could understand the meaning of magic circles, out of the room...`
`............I thought of the magic circles as a second set of messages from {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`...What does this one mean?`
` ..................Damn it...!`
`We've chased out all the suspicious people; now all we have to do is stay barricaded here until morning, and...then will everything be over?`
`......Once the typhoon has passed, when the seagulls cry, will everything be resolved?`
`But the letter that had unexpectedly appeared in the study had rejected that naivety.`
`{n}......It had made it very clear that, if time ran out, it would mean victory for the witch.`
`When time runs out, is the witch planning to take on the offensive?`
`{n}......Is she, finally, planning to display some fearful magical power, maybe something that could have been used to kill six adults at once?`
`...Wait, when {i:is} time supposed to run out?`
` ......I don't know...anything...`
`"............Now......we should finally be safe.`
` ......Finally.`
` .........Definitely..."`
`Even as she said that, Aunt Natsuhi couldn't stop gripping that rifle.`
` ...There was no release in the tension of her expression.`
`Of course, none of us felt like breathing a sigh of relief yet.`
`.........At least, not until we could hear the cries of the seagulls once more......`
`After we chased them out, ......nobody said another word.`
`...We had exiled all of the suspicious ones.`
` Even though we had known that there might be some innocents among them, we had exiled them all the same.`
`......We had chased them out of this paradise,`
` where people didn't have to doubt each other.`
`However, our motive for chasing them out had been suspicion of our fellow man—the worst kind of crime for a human.`
`......If we had been able to accept the existence of a 19th person, of the witch,`
` ......then we all might still be talking face to face, trusting in each other.`
`In that instant,`
` we had agreed to chase out all of the suspicious people.`
`......But had that been the right thing to do?`
`......During this endless silence, we could do nothing but be quietly tormented by that sin......`
`Aunt Natsuhi was facing the door, seated all the way back in her sofa, not letting go of her rifle for even an instant.`
`......She would probably spend the night staring at the door without a wink of sleep.`
`George‐aniki was gazing through a gap in the closed curtains by the window,`
` looking down at the courtyard and the mansion that surrounded it.`
`......Whether he was checking to see if any suspicious shadows would become visible through the window,`
` ...or whether he was engaged in some deep internal conversation, ...I couldn't tell.`
`Jessica was sitting at an angle on the sofa next to Aunt Natsuhi's...with a dead expression on her face.`
`......And every once in a while, as though she'd just remembered something, she would take out the inhaler that she had used during her asthma attack and stick it in her mouth.`
`...I just heard it from Aniki, but,`
` ......apparently Jessica liked Kanon‐kun.`
`It seems that it was such a vague thing that she hadn't realized it herself.`
`...You know.`
` It's the kind of thing that other people tend to spot before the person in question realizes it.`
`...In that case,`
` ......she might have first learned of her feelings when the person she liked died.`
`.........It was truly pitiful and sad.`
`Come to think of it, ...Kanon‐kun had been the one to hand her that inhaler.`
` ......Maybe she was remembering that.`
`As for me, ......I was fishing around Grandfather's study, thinking I'd research the meaning of the magic circle on the second sheet of the letter.`
`Even though we were shut up here in a defensive position, my rebellious nature made me want to keep up the offense, find some key to all of this.`
`...We have plenty of time until tomorrow morning anyway.`
`{n}No matter what I do with that time, no one can find fault with it.`
`No one else showed that much interest in this magic circle.`
`...Its meaning was unknown, and once we understood it, we were sure to find some message that would cause us unnecessary anguish.`
`......I also agreed about this.`
`...However, I still couldn't let it go, so I killed time pretending to research it...`
`".........You sure are enthusiastic.`
` ...Did you find anything that might serve as a hint...?"`
`"...Not a thing.`
` The first task is even finding a book written in Japanese.`
` ...Just how many languages could Grandfather read?`
` He's incredible."`
`"Aren't you tired, Battler‐kun?`
` ......You should take a rest while someone else is staying awake for you.`
` Aunt Natsuhi may be saying she'll stay vigilant all night, but there's no way her body can handle that.`
` We should take turns sleeping."`
`"Then you sleep first, Aniki.`
` .........I'm gonna keep on with my little research until the drowsiness hits."`
`"......That magic circle?"`
`"...Pretty much.`
` We've got plenty of time to kill.`
` ......I thought it'd be interesting to find out what kind of message the great {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama put in it."`
`"............I wouldn't.`
` Keep that up and you'll get possessed by something weird."`
`"Relax.`
` I've been certified by Maria.`
` ...She said I'm utterly lacking any spiritual talent.`
` Ihihi...!"`
`".........Were we too...`
`.........cruel...`
`to Maria?"`
`"............Jessica.`
` ...You mustn't think that now."`
`"But Mom...`
` If Maria wasn't involved, and the killer's someone totally different,`
` ......they're obviously gonna go for the easy targets.`
` ......If she's killed because of this,`
` .........then we've just...let her die..."`
`A gloomy silence settled once again.`
` ...It looked like Jessica regretted that she'd let her emotions take hold of her and snapped at Maria.`
`......She always was like that.`
`{n}...Always acted tough, went too far, and regretted it later.`
`"......I understand how you feel, but Maria was in close contact with the culprit,`
` and what's worse, she seemed to be taking their side with her endless series of mystifying statements.`
` .........I am relieved that we chased her out."`
`"...That's pretty harsh, Aunt Natsuhi.`
` ......Couldn't it just have been the nonsense of a nine‐year‐old girl?"`
`Even I thought I was being brazen saying that...`
`{n}I myself had thought Maria was creepy on several occasions today, and had doubted her true nature.`
`......And when Maria had been chased out of this room, I couldn't deny that I'd felt some relief...`
`"..................If that is the case,`
` then tomorrow, I will apologize for what I did.`
` ...I will take full responsibility for chasing them out of this room.`
` ......This isn't something that the rest of you have to worry about."`
`I could feel a tragic determination in Aunt Natsuhi's words.`
`{n}......To protect her own daughter, she would resolutely chase out the suspicious ones.`
`...And if, as a result, she had left to die those people who had the misfortune to be suspected, so be it.`
` ...She was prepared to take full responsibility.`
`"...Why does Maria have to keep saying stuff like that?`
` She's bringing about her own ruin..."`
`"..................I think that the reason Maria‐chan adores witches and magic so much...`
`......might be because of Auntie Rosa."`
`"Because of Auntie Rosa?`
` What does she have to do with this?"`
`"......I think you must have realized it too, Battler‐kun.`
` ...Maria‐chan's real father ran off somewhere a long time ago.`
` ...Although Auntie's trying to cover it up by saying he's on a foreign business trip."`
`"............Talking about Rosa‐san's family has become a kind of taboo in the Ushiromiya family."`
`"I think Auntie even thought about remarrying.`
` ......But I also believe Maria‐chan may have become her shackles and made that quite difficult.`
` ............After all, she sometimes...`
`got incredibly emotional and took it all out on Maria‐chan."`
`"............I agree with you there.`
` ......It looked like Auntie Rosa was trying hard to like Maria."`
`"......Which means...`
`...that she didn't really like her.`
` .........I'll bet she had some strong thoughts about Maria, standing in the way of her getting remarried..."`
`"...I think that the emotional rejection from her mother must have left some deep scars on her young heart.`
` ......So when she learned about this occult hobby from somewhere, she immersed herself in it so she could fill the holes in her heart."`
`"......Did you know?`
` To Maria‐chan, the image of a witch isn't negative at all.`
` ...Remember yesterday, at the beach, when she showed us her notebook...?"`
`"......Yeah.`
` ...It was full of all those fun‐looking scribbles."`
`Yesterday, when we had doubted the witch down by the beach...`
`{n}...Maria had gotten all riled up and started explaining about witches.`
`And not one of the pages had shown a picture of an ugly witch.`
`They were all brightly colored, beautiful, cute witches who looked like they were having fun.`
`There was absolutely nothing sinister about them, like a boy might have imagined;`
` ...they were beings adorned with beautiful dresses, who could grant anyone's dreams with their mysterious magic and who made everyone happy.`
`......The sorrow of not being loved by her mother.`
`...Had Maria sought salvation from the witches as beings who could save her from that sorrow and make her happy?`
`Someday a witch would come, and using her wonderful magic, would bring Maria happiness.`
`......Even though she believed that, as she grew older, she had to face reality as her fleeting dreams were sliced to ribbons one by one.`
`.........If, in front of a girl like that,`
` something claiming to be the witch of Rokkenjima appeared,`
` and whispered that she would take Maria to the Golden Land, where Maria could be happy...`
`"...........................`
` ......I...`
`......think it's time I confessed what's in my heart.`
` ......Maybe throwing out Maria‐chan,`
` ......no, ......Genji‐san and the rest too,`
` ......was probably...the wrong thing to do..."`
`"...............I do feel...`
`......guilty..."`
`Since Jessica had been the one to face them and slam them with words of rejection,`
` ...her conscience must be tormenting her a lot right now.`
`"Then, how do you all explain that letter?`
` No one could have set it there except the four people standing behind me.`
` I was able to see that quite clearly with my own eyes."`
`"...If those four are innocent, how was that letter placed there in a locked room with eight people in it?"`
`"............That's just it...`
` ......When you put it that way, those four really do seem suspicious.`
` .........But."`
`"...{i:That's no goddamn good}.`
` Yeah, {i:it's no goddamn good at all}..."`
`"No good? ...What is?"`
`"Right.`
` .........It might not be worth anything anymore, but let me flip over the chessboard again.`
` ...What I mean is, if one of those four really is the culprit, it makes no sense."`
`"...........................That's right...`
` ......Wasn't setting that letter openly on the table the same as confessing that one of them was the culprit?"`
`"...You're right, that makes no sense.`
` ......If you were gonna do that, you'd put it, like, in the crack of the door, to make it look like someone had slipped it in from the outside!`
` Yeah, they must've known they'd be suspected if they didn't make it look like the culprit was outside the room!"`
`"Yeah, that's it exactly.`
` ...If the culprit was one of those four,`
` setting that letter right in the middle of the table would be both risky and meaningless."`
`"............But, putting aside whatever trick they used to set it there,`
` ......if we assume that the culprit is someone other than those four, ...in other words, someone who was outside the room,`
` then they had a lot to gain from that letter..."`
`"...............Stop that, Battler‐kun.`
` ...At this point, that issue is insignificant."`
`Aunt Natsuhi quickly guessed what I was getting at.`
`......No, maybe she had thought of it long before I had, and had simply held her tongue...`
`"......If the culprit was outside the room, ...then once we shut ourselves up in a locked room where the culprit couldn't touch us, it was all over for them.`
` .........That's right.`
` It's the same as the theory I proposed about how Grandfather disappeared from this room, isn't it?"`
`"......That theory that Grandfather left the room of his own accord.`
` ...If the culprit used some tactic to lure him out, and Grandfather left of his own accord, then..."`
`Come to think of it, ...even Maria had said it, when we found the scorpion magic circle on the doorknob to the study.`
`......{f:5:Beatrice} couldn't get through this door.`
`But she might be able to induce someone to leave of their own accord.`
`"......In that case,`
` ............that would mean we fell for the culprit's trap completely...`
`and sent out some new potential sacrifices..."`
`"............Genji and the rest aren't fools.`
` If they desired to protect themselves, they would quickly think of the next safest place after this room.`
` They are surely hiding themselves there."`
`Aunt Natsuhi hadn't answered the question.`
`......She herself realized that if the culprit wasn't in that group, that letter could easily have been a trap.`
`However, it wasn't worth the risk of calling back the people she had once thrown out.`
`...To Aunt Natsuhi, right now, her greatest and only duty was to protect the children.........`
`And to that end, she was thinking, a few sacrifices may be an unfortunate necessity...`
`".........Hey, Aunt Natsuhi.`
` Let me ask something a little difficult, alright?`
` ......If, by coincidence, Jessica had also been standing behind you at that time,`
` .........would you have chased Jessica from the room too?"`
`"......................................."`
`"Sure, there may have been a degree of cruelty to it.`
` ...But, as a mother, you thought you should protect your daughter no matter what.`
` And it was out of that duty that you sent them out, fully aware you'd eventually be held responsible for it."`
`"............I'm not trying to criticize you for it or anything.`
` I just, umm.`
` .........I was just thinking about what a great mother Jessica has."`
`"......Yes.`
` ...You've been dealing with these incidents since morning, and you've been pulling all of us along this whole time, without losing your composure."`
`"......If you had been as confused as the rest of us, every last one of us may have been in the culprit's grasp by now.`
` ...So I think that we all have to thank you."`
`"........................Thank you."`
`"...............`
` ...So what you're trying to say is...this, right?`
` .........You want her to act as Maria's mother too......?"`
`"................................."`
`"......I...`
`.........always thought of Maria as a real little sister and adored her.`
` .........And yet,`
` ......a bunch of things happened, we got a bit confused...`
` ......And I said a lot of mean things to her and hurt her..."`
`"..................Mom,`
` ...please.`
` .........Let's stay with Maria,`
` .........no, with everyone...`
` .........There was no...`
`culprit among us......`
` Why can't the culprit behind all this...`
`......just be the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}...?`
` So let's just......stop doubting each other......"`
`Aunt Natsuhi closed her eyes for a short while.`
`...Was she coping with her throbbing headache again, ...or was she thinking of something...`
`".................................`
` Jessica,`
` .........you are my precious daughter, ......the daughter I was finally blessed with a whole twelve years after I married my husband.`
` I would become the worst kind of demon to protect you."`
`That was some pretty strong language at the end there...`
`{n}She realized very well that these were only words, but even so, she was strongly resolved to protect her daughter even if she had to become a demon.`
`............But that was because she was tormented by guilt.`
`.........Today had been so long.`
`{n}...So many things had happened in one day, ...and we had been put under such pressure...`
`......I wonder if we have the right to greet tomorrow the way we are now......`
`...............Th‐...There it is.`
`"......I found it.`
` ...It's this magic circle."`
`Within the books I had been constantly flipping through, I had finally found the same magic circle that had been drawn on the second sheet of the letter.`
`George‐aniki peered at it as well.`
`This magic circle's name was......the third magic circle of Mars.`
`The Hebrew written on it was from the Old Testament's Book of Psalms, Psalm 77, verse 13.`
`"What god is so great as our God?"`
`The meaning of the magic circle was...`
`......“discord”.`
`{n}...It agitates internal divisions and causes the enemy to bring about their own downfall.`
`"............Whoa, whoa...`
` Seriously......?"`
`Could there be a more fitting way to describe our current situation and mental state?`
`We couldn't help but be stunned into silence.`
`"......So......this letter was a trap...?!`
` How'd they put it here?!`
` There wasn't anyone in this room except for us eight!"`
`"A‐anyway, let's ignore how they got it in here for now.`
` ......The culprit was after just one thing!`
` They wanted to spread the seeds of doubt inside this impregnable study and use us to throw the sacrificial sheep out...!!"`
`"In that case...what they're after...is the people who went out of the room......!!"`
`"M‐Mom, ......what should we do?!!`
` Those four are in danger...!"`
`"...................................."`
`It wasn't surprising that Aunt Natsuhi remained unpleasantly silent.`
`{n}...Even if this was all a trap by the culprit, even if the four who had been chased out of the room were in danger,`
` it had nothing to do with the safety of the four people in here.`
`And there was no way to prove the innocence of the four people we had kicked out.`
`{n}......If we're willing to let them die, then we shouldn't leave this room no matter what.`
` ...That way is...safest!!`
`Just then, all of a sudden, the piercing sound of a phone rang through the room.`
`It was the antique extension phone that was set on Grandfather's study desk.`
`......It had started ringing right as we began this conversation.`
`{n}It was only natural that we would think it an SOS from the others we had kicked out.`
`But then Aunt Natsuhi spoke.`
`"How, .........how can the telephone be—?!`
` It should be broken down and unusable...!!"`
`"That doesn't matter...!`
` If that's Maria and the others calling for help...!"`
`"If the problem with the phones was the culprit's work in the first place......`
`then this phone call is...`
`......more than likely......"`
`With that one sentence, the ring of the phone, which had sounded like a scream for help...started to sound like a ghastly summons from some unknown person...!`
`Aunt Natsuhi hesitated over whether to pick up the receiver.`
`"Le‐let's take it, Auntie...!`
` The phones might have been fixed for some reason...`
` It could still be an urgent call from Maria‐chan and the rest...!"`
`"That's right...!`
` And on the slight chance that it is a call from the killer, bring it on!`
` Let 'em friggin' talk...!`
` It's just a phone call.`
` No matter what they babble through the receiver, it's not like it's gonna hurt you...!!"`
`"......If you won't pick it up,`
` ......then I will......!"`
`"I, ......I will take it.`
` ......Hello?"`
`I stretched out my hand to take the receiver, but Aunt Natsuhi picked it up first as if to say she had it under control.`
`...We all held our breath, trying to figure out who the person on the other end of the phone was...`
`But for a while, Aunt Natsuhi just kept saying "hello".`
`.........A silent phone call...?`
`{n}There's no way Maria and the others would do something so creepy.`
`......Which means...`
`...this phone call...`
` .........Might it possibly,`
` ...really.........`
`Natsuhi stopped repeating "hello" and strained her ears.`
`.........Because she thought she heard something far away on the other end of the receiver.`
`............What was it......?`
`"......Huh?`
` .....................Is someone...`
`...............singing...?"`
`"What do you mean......singing?"`
`".........I don't know.`
` Faintly, from the other end of the phone, ......I can hear someone singing......`
` I wonder what...it could be......"`
`"G‐give it here for a sec...`
` Hello?!`
` .................................?!"`
`I half forced the receiver from the stunned Aunt Natsuhi's hand and pressed it against my ear.`
`...............At first, I didn't hear anything.`
`...But, ......because I had been told about it beforehand, I noticed.`
`............Not in a quiet voice, but rather, far away from the receiver,`
` ...............I could hear a girl singing a song.`
`......The voice sort of sounded like Maria's, ...but that just made the situation even more inexplicable.`
`At the very least, the one who had made the phone call hadn't been Maria.`
`{n}After all, Maria was singing some song far away from the receiver.`
`......In that case, the one who made the phone call should have been Genji‐san, Kumasawa‐san, or Doctor Nanjo.`
`............And yet, they weren't saying anything.`
` ...Why...?`
` For what reason...`
` ............Who was the person who made this phone call......?!?!`
`"Hey!!`
` Hello?!!`
` Who is it? Answer me!!`
` Is that Maria singing?!`
` Answer me!!"`
`"Wh‐...what's going on?!`
` What is it?!"`
`"I don't know...!`
` All I can say is,`
` ...this is probably a trap, ......and Maria's in trouble..."`
`Aunt Natsuhi took the receiver again, but after calling into it several more times, she realized that she wasn't getting anywhere and hung up.`
`She then dialed quickly.`
` ......And clucked her tongue.`
`Oh, right, if the phones are back, we should be able to reach the police.`
`{n}......But judging by her reaction, the outside line still wouldn't connect.`
`"......Le‐let's go!`
` Even if we know it might be a trap, we have to go!"`
`"Yeah, absolutely!!`
` Jessica, Aunt Natsuhi, stay here!"`
`When Aniki and I tried to dash out, Aunt Natsuhi stopped us.`
`"Wait just a minute.`
` .........I cannot let you go alone.`
` I will go too.`
` Jessica, you wait here."`
`"And you'd have me be the only one left out?!`
` Not a chance, I'm coming too...!!"`
`"Yeah, it might be better that way.`
` ...If the goal of that phone call was to split us up further, it wouldn't be a good idea to leave someone to watch this room."`
`"There's no time to argue.`
` Let's all go!"`
`Aunt Natsuhi raised the rifle high and took the lead.`
`I needed a weapon myself as well.`
`I found a three‐pronged candelabra, which looked like it could be used for some strange ritual, and armed myself with it.`
`With the spikes it had to fit the candles on, although they were short, it was almost like a three‐pronged spear.`
`Then the four of us left the study.`
` We left the study, which should have been the safest place inside the mansion.`
`And so we had been lured out, despite the fact that we had barricaded ourselves in a safe locked room,`
` ...and perhaps, we were even...`
`...repeating exactly the same series of events that had led to Grandfather disappearing from there...`
`"Mariaaa!!`
` Where are youuu?!`
` Answer meee!!"`
`I listened closely, but didn't hear anything...`
`{n}The mansion was vast, and the sound of the rain even noisier than before, as if the passing typhoon was making its last stand.`
`"...Maria‐chan said that she wanted to watch TV in the parlor, right?!`
` Let's try going downstairs!"`
`"............Yes.`
` Good idea.`
` ......Everyone, be mindful of your surroundings!"`
`"Yeah!!"`
`With Aunt Natsuhi in the center, her rifle readied and her finger on the trigger,`
` we moved in a group, our backs together, checking our surroundings in all directions......`
`As though the power of that magic circle designed to spread discord had brought it all into being,`
` ...we had split up, and furthermore, had been dragged into dangerous territory.`
`......In other words, even now in this very moment, we were doing just what the culprit wanted us to do.`
` ...This was now a strange space where it wouldn't be odd for anything to suddenly occur...`
`Aunt Natsuhi nervously pointed the barrel of the gun at every dark spot and shadow.`
`It felt like that motion was out of fear rather than caution...`
`But the rifle she held in her hand would surely also be our trump card that the killer was afraid of...`
`"......You know, I've been thinking.`
` ...It wouldn't be impossible to stick one of those "icepicks" into someone's chest, like in Kanon‐kun's case.`
` ......But splitting the skull and sticking them into the forehead, like it was with my parents, wouldn't be that easy."`
`"You think the culprit had that kind of animal strength...?!"`
`"...They probably have some kind of weapon, a device that can shoot or pound in those "icepicks".`
` That handle was too short to be driven in that deeply by human strength alone."`
`"......Whatever the case, they have enough force to break through a skull.`
` ...It seems that Kanon's wound even reached his lungs.`
` ......Even if you see our opponent, do not step out in front.`
` You must not move away from my back."`
`Just how sinister and frightening was this weapon that could shoot those creepy icepicks?`
`......And could I do anything to combat it with just this candlestick in my hand?`
`In the first murder, the culprit had probably assaulted four of our parents at once as they discussed the inheritance problem in the dining hall.`
`{n}...And we also had four people.`
`......Apparently, I wasn't the only person thinking this.`
`......George‐aniki,`
` Jessica,`
` ...and, of course, Aunt Natsuhi...`
`...were stretching their senses to the utmost limit, in the highest and worst state of tension, slowly advancing one step, then another...`
`.........Aaah, what sinful people are we...`
`...A world as terrifying as this, ......and we pushed Maria and the rest right into the middle of it, just because of the seeds of doubt spread by that single letter...`
`We finally reached the first floor.`
` .........The parlor was just across the hall.`
`When we listened carefully, .........we could hear it faintly.`
`{n}......Maria's eerie singing voice.`
`She wasn't singing naturally, as though she were in a good mood.`
`.........She was singing mechanically, as if she was in music class in school and had been ordered to sing.`
`...The song she was singing was just a common folk song, one that everyone has probably sung in school at one time or another.`
`......But why that, in the middle of the night, alone, with all her heart, over and over, why...?!`
`When we had just left the study, we had called out in loud voices, asking Maria where she was.`
`...But this time, no one said even a single word.`
`......We hid our breath and the sound of our footsteps, heightened all our senses, and examined everywhere around us to a neurotic degree......as we advanced each step...`
`The door to the parlor was closed.`
`{n}But we could hear Maria's singing voice through it...`
`Aunt Natsuhi put her hand on the handle of the doorknob...`
` George‐aniki stopped her.`
`"...I'll open the door...`
` Aunt Natsuhi, Battler‐kun, ready your weapons."`
`"............All right.`
` ......Be careful."`
`"They might attack as soon as we open it...`
` George nii‐san, watch yourself...!"`
`"...Sure...`
` .........OK then, ......here we go...!`
` ............nn?!"`
`He tried to open it, but immediately felt the hard resistance of the lock.`
`Aunt Natsuhi took the bundle of keys from her pocket and gave them to George.`
`......There were about ten keys, and none of us had a clue which was which.`
`Because of this, George had to fumble around loudly and test several of the keys.`
`......Since we had hidden our footsteps, preparing to make a surprise attack on the room, this felt almost fatal...`
`The whole time, we could hear Maria's voice from the parlor, singing the same song over and over.`
`......It was like a broken, crazy cassette tape...`
`In the morning, we had been in that room the whole time.`
`{n}...All of the frightening things had occurred outside that room.`
`{n}...So, we had convinced ourselves that even if nowhere else could be trusted, that room alone was safe.`
`.........That baseless impression was quickly falling apart......`
`"............Nn, .........it unlocked."`
`"...Thank you.`
` George‐kun, Jessica, move behind me."`
`"......Auntie.`
` Let's all jump in at once and split up in different directions.`
` If we just stand around after opening the door, those icepicks might fly right through the center...!"`
`"I'm well aware.`
` .........Ready...?"`
`"Ihihi...!`
` Actually, I kinda wish I could call it quits...!"`
`I readied myself.`
`{n}...If they're going to throw icepicks at me, we'll see how they like my candlestick!!`
`"......Go!!!"`
`Aunt Natsuhi and I rammed into the door as we flew into the parlor,`
` quickly splitting up left and right, and searching the parlor for someone who might be waiting for us.`
`But what our eyes landed upon...`
`.........was an altogether...`
`.........outlandish scene...`
`The parlor.........was stained with blood.`
`This place, where we had spent almost the entire day,`
` where we had pressed in together to protect ourselves from some unknown malice,`
` had become stained with fresh blood, had become an ocean of blood...!!`
`On the floor lay Genji‐san, Kumasawa‐san, and Doctor Nanjo, their entire bodies stained bright red with blood...`
`.........But the only way we could identify them was by their clothes.`
`......That was because......aaah, that's right, this was how this whole tragedy started...!!`
`Their faces were all mashed up like Dad and the others in the storehouse, ...and you couldn't even tell where the eyes and noses were!!`
`It was like someone had vulgarly gobbled apart a tomato pot stew wrapped in a pie crust, ......all globby and sloppy, ...uuwaaaaaaAAAAAAaaaaaaAAAAaahhh!!`
`And that wasn't all.`
`{n}Their bodies had other wounds.`
`......They were those "demon's icepicks"!`
`{n}They were in......Genji‐san's stomach, Doctor Nanjo's thigh—no, his knee?`
`{n}Yeah, it would be his knee...! In the epitaph, the sixth twilight was the stomach,`
`{n}and on the seventh twilight, it said to gouge the knee!`
`So after seeing one of them stuck near Kumasawa baa‐chan's calf, I couldn't help masochistically laughing "yeah, of course it would be"...!!`
`On the sixth twilight, gouge the stomach and kill.`
`{n}On the seventh twilight, gouge the knee and kill.`
`{n}On the eighth twilight, gouge the leg and kill.`
`Aaaaaah, ......now even the eighth twilight is over.`
` And the next one, the ninth twilight, ......what was it again...?`
`Maria......was there.`
`.........She was facing the far wall, ...standing stock still, completely alone.`
`Facing away from this horrible scene, standing in front of the wall, singing her song over and over...`
`There was nothing else in the room.`
`......Just the corpses of the three who had been brutally killed, ...and the receiver, still off its hook, showing that it had been this room that the call had come from.`
`.........Just that and Maria, her back to this scene, facing the wall as she kept on singing......`
`......We couldn't even scream at this......bizarre scene.`
`...We could only stare shocked, our mouths hanging loosely open......`
`"Ma‐.........Maria............?"`
`Jessica called out to her.`
`...But Maria showed no reaction.`
`{n}.........Alone, she kept singing, on and on......`
`We had come here trying to save Maria from some approaching danger.`
`...So, now that we had found her, we should have been running up to her, hugging her, joyous that she was safe.`
` ......And yet, not one of us could do that...!`
`Everyone thought it. But they couldn't say it.`
` After all, because...because...that's right, it's crazy, and yet......but no, it couldn't be.........!!`
`"Ma‐......Maria!!`
` Stop singing!!`
` Are you listening?!!"`
`At some point, ...Aunt Natsuhi and I had pointed our weapons at Maria's back.`
`......I yelled at Maria in a violent voice.`
`{n}......But there was no reaction.`
`{n}She just kept singing...!!`
`With the candlestick still readied, I ran up to her, and forcefully—no, violently slammed my hand down on her shoulder.`
` Then I pulled on her shoulder, forcing her to turn around!`
`"......Uuoa.`
` ............Uu."`
`Maria's small body was quickly pulled down and fell.`
`...And, as though unhappy about how her singing had been interrupted, ......she looked into my face with her usual expression.`
`Even in this gruesome situation,`
` {i:she was just like normal!!}`
`"Maria, what the hell is this?!`
` Who, ...who did this?!"`
`".........Uu.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"Enough of that {i:fucking} bullshit!!!"`
`I threw the candlestick I had been holding against the wall.`
`{n}The violence of that reckless sound should have gone straight into Maria's heart.`
`{n}......But her expression didn't change at all!`
`"Battler‐kun, stop!`
` Maria‐chan, ......this time, you should have seen the face of the culprit who killed these three.`
` Was the culprit......the same {f:5:Beatrice} who gave you the letter?!"`
`"......Uu.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"Well, now we know for sure.`
` There is a 19th person, {f:5:Beatrice} does exist!!"`
`"Then, Maria, I'm sure you'll tell me this, at least?`
` How did they kill these three people?`
` What the hell did they do to them to kill them in such a brutal way?!"`
`"......Don't know."`
`"How could you not know?!`
` It happened in this room!!`
` Are you trying to tell me you were so absorbed in singing that song that you didn't even notice?!"`
`"Calm down, Battler‐kun!!`
` Ma‐...Maria‐chan.`
` Let's you and me have a chat.`
` ...Okay?"`
`George‐aniki, as he always did, crouched down next to Maria so that their eyes met, and talked to her very kindly...`
`"...Maria‐chan, ......can you tell me why were you facing the wall and singing that song...?"`
`".........Uu.`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice} said to face the wall and keep singing for a long time.`
` Uu."`
`"So {f:5:Beatrice} came here, then?!`
` Genji‐san and the rest were still alive at that point, right?!"`
`"......Uu.`
` We all came into the parlor together and sat down.`
` ......Genji‐san made sure to lock the door."`
`"It {i:was} locked when we got here......but then, how did {f:5:Beatrice} get into the parlor?!!"`
`"Uu.`
` But {f:5:Beatrice} is a witch so locks don't matter.`
` She turned into butterflies and came in through the crack in the door."`
`"Huuhh?!`
` Give it a rest with your goddamn jokes!!!`
` Like hell that happened!`
` What are you going on about?!"`
`"Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!!`
` You can't believe it?`
` That's why I didn't want to say.`
` Even if I tell you, you don't believe."`
`"But {f:5:Beatrice} is a witch.`
` She can do anything with her strange magic.`
` That's why {f:5:Beatrice} doesn't care whether a door is locked or not.`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi...!"`
`"A‐and then?! After {f:5:Beatrice} appeared, what happened to everyone?!"`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice} talked to us.`
` She said Grandfather's study was protected by a powerful force, and she couldn't enter no matter what she did.`
` So she told us she'd select the three sacrifices from the four people in the parlor.`
` ......They all begged her not to."`
`"Kihihihihihihihihi, Kumasawa‐san kept saying "please, please don't".`
` But {f:5:Beatrice} chose.`
` ......And when she did, she said I would be fine.`
` .........Why do you think?"`
`"It's because I had the scorpion charm with the fifth magic circle of Mars, upon which Battler prayed for my safety and which he put his feelings into.`
` Because of that power, {f:5:Beatrice} couldn't do anything to me, and me alone."`
`"So she decided to use the other three for the sacrifices.`
` And then she said this to me."`
`{e:070:― Come, face the wall and sing a song for me.`
`......You will sing lots and lots of songs, so no matter what happens, no matter what you hear, you won't hear you won't hear you won't know.`
`Come, let me hear many fun songs.}`
`"So I was singing the whole time.`
` Over and over.`
` So I didn't hear anything, didn't know anything.`
` ...And then all of you came.`
` Uu."`
`"You expect me to believe that crap?!`
` Don't take me for a moron!!!"`
`"Kihhihihihihi!`
` Then who will you suspect this time?`
` Suspect me?`
` Try killing me right here?`
` Even if you do that, {f:5:Beatrice} won't stop "existing".`
` Now, the eighth twilight is over, and {f:5:Beatrice} will revive!!"`
`"No she fucking won't, I'm done with your shit, I've had enough to last me a lifetime!!`
` There's no such thing as witches, that crap won't work on me!!!"`
`"I won't accept it, {f:5:Beatrice} doesn't "exist"!!`
` I'll never accept that she does!!`
` So I won't let her exist, I won't let her revive!!`
` The legend's a legend and that's all it's ever gonna be.`
` I won't accept something like that!!!!!!!!"`
`"Battler, stop...!!`
` It's not like Maria killed them or let them die!!`
` B‐{f:5:Beatrice} came, and Maria had to obey, unable to resist...!!"`
`"............Huh?!`
` A‐......Aunt Natsuhi?`
` Sh‐she isn't here...!"`
`"Huh? What?!"`
`"M‐Mom? Where did she go......?!"`
`"...............She went out by herself just now, reading a letter."`
`Letter?!`
` Th‐that makes sense, the culprit's done with the eighth twilight and it's all gone swimmingly for them.`
`They might well have left a letter so they could brag even more.`
`We had been so wrapped up in questioning Maria that we forgot to look for one...!`
`But even as well armed as she was, why had she left the room all by herself in this dangerous mansion after reading it?!`
`Jessica tried to chase after her and tugged at the handle to the door, but it resisted strangely and wouldn't open...!`
`"Mom, Mom!!"`
`"What's going on?!!`
` Open... Open...!!!"`
`It was only natural.`
` ......Natsuhi had picked up the candlestick, which Battler had thrown at the wall and which had fallen to the floor.`
`.........She had then skillfully wedged it between the doorknobs on the double doors like a bolt, holding them closed.`
`...The intricate design of the candlestick meant it jammed well, and formed a truly sturdy seal on the door.`
`The tragic scream of a daughter for her mother...`
`{n}Did it reach Natsuhi's ears, or not...?`
`Natsuhi was...`
`......alone in the entrance hall.`
`It was the place where the portrait of {f:5:Beatrice} had been hung.`
`Natsuhi threw down the final letter from {f:5:Beatrice} that she had read in the parlor,`
` readied her rifle again, and in a voice that rang clear, yelled in the massive space that was the entrance hall.`
`"......I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi, representative of the Ushiromiya family!!!`
` Show yourself,`
` ...Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!!"`
`The entrance hall was dimly lit.`
` Other than a faint light which shone on the center of the room, everything was blotted out by the jet‐black darkness.`
`......In that darkness,`
` .........butterflies glittering in gold squirmed, twinkled,`
` ......and sneered.`
`Natsuhi gave one more huge gulp, and pointed the cold barrel of the gun at the gold butterflies......`
`"............At last...`
`.........you have shown yourself.`
` ...............I still can't believe...`
`......that something like you really existed...`
` ......But that isn't a problem."`
`"......Both I, bearing the title of representative to the Ushiromiya family,`
` and you, claiming to have succeeded the head of the Ushiromiya family, are here right now.`
` ......At this point, whether you are a witch or not is a trivial problem!"`
`"...............Come,`
` ...let us settle this.`
` ...Which of us will truly succeed the Ushiromiya family?`
` ...Me, Ushiromiya Natsuhi,`
` ............or you,`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` Allow me to respectfully accept your request for a duel...!!"`
`The gold butterflies slowly formed a human shape, which walked into the dim light...`
`Natsuhi readied the rifle,`
` ......and glared.`
`The witch raised her golden staff overhead,`
` ...and laughed.`
`Natsuhi's finger...`
`slowly squeezed the trigger.........`
`"And...gooooooooooooooooo!!!"`
`Battler made an all out dash at the door and rammed into it, crushing the candlestick which had been barring it, and making it possible for a big gap to be opened in the door.`
`He kept kicking the candlestick through that gap, and the door was finally released.`
`At that time, they heard it.`
`{n}...They clearly heard, just once, the crisp sound of gunfire...!`
`"Mom!!`
` Moooooooooooooooom!!!"`
`"Jessica‐chan, you mustn't run off by yourself...!!"`
`"That was the sound of a gun just now!!`
` Aunt Natsuhi just shot!!"`
`At who?`
` At the culprit!!!`
`The noise had come from the entrance hall.`
`{n}And the entrance hall......looked like a stage.`
`Like the heroine of a tragedy, lying down and bathed in light,`
` .........arrayed in the beauty of that silence,`
` ......Aunt Natsuhi was face up, crumpled on the floor......`
`Half‐crazed, Jessica ran up to Aunt Natsuhi.`
`...On her forehead,`
` ...it was almost as though a sparkling shard of pigeon's blood ruby had been placed there.`
`......And,`
` ......from it, a single stream...`
`.........of blood makeup...`
`passed by her eye,`
` and began to traverse her face......`
`The faint smell of gunpowder smoke came from the barrel of the rifle Aunt Natsuhi still grasped.`
`............Huh?`
` Then,`
` .........then,`
` ............she...`
`...shot...`
`herself......in the forehead...?!`
` Why?!`
`"Mom, Mom Mom!!!`
` UWAAAAAaaaAAAAaaAAAA!!!"`
`"...I, I don't get it!!`
` Why did Auntie run away alone,`
` ......why did she shoot through her own forehead?!"`
`"......Maria‐chan, Aunt Natsuhi read a letter before she left the room, right?!`
` There's no letter here!`
` Damn it, what did she read, and why was she lured out here?!"`
`"I don't know I don't know, who cares about that...!!`
` What the hell, why suicide?!`
` Why......did you leave me alone?!"`
`"UwaaaaaaAAAAAaaaaaa......!!"`
`Jessica clung to her mother's corpse, crying earnestly...`
`My body consumed by an anger I didn't know what to do with, I stole the rifle from Aunt Natsuhi's hand,`
` and spun around, pointing the barrel of the gun into the darkness on all sides, as though I was pointing a light from a lighthouse, trying to find the culprit.`
`George‐aniki, even in this situation, was trying to calmly figure something out, but that effort might have been doomed to futility.`
`............And Maria alone was completely indifferent.`
`{n}......Is she treating this as some kind of predetermined fate?`
`No, that's not it.`
` This is all......a prelude to a wonderful world.`
`The door to the Golden Land will finally...`
`open.`
`"......On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive.`
` ......And on the tenth twilight, the journey ends, and you shall reach the Home of the Gold."`
`"......It's all over now, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Congratulations, congratulations.`
` ...So lead me, lead me to the Golden Land you told me of...`
` ...Right now......!!"`
`There, all of the dead will be resurrected, and even the love they once possessed will be revived.`
`{n}............So, in Maria's eyes, it's just as though all of today's tragedies never even happened.`
`And all those days she spent deprived of love never happened either.`
`"Will you cut that out?!`
` What's so fun, what's to be congratulated?!!`
` There were eighteen people on this island!`
` Fourteen are dead!`
` Only the four of us are left!!"`
`"I'm definitely not gonna die!`
` Until the night is over—no, until the typhoon passes, and the seagulls gather again at the harbor, I'm definitely not gonna die!!`
` I'm gonna survive, I'm gonna survive, definitely!!"`
`"............Kihihihihihi.`
` Give it up, Battler.`
` ...Guns are meaningless against {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Besides, survival and everything else doesn't matter now, because it's over.`
` {i:The journey has already ended.}`
` ......See, look at the clock."`
`...Huh?`
` The clock?`
`{n}Hearing those words, I looked at my wristwatch.`
`Both hands were almost touching near the top.`
`{n}......Very soon, it would be 12 a.m.`
` ...In other words, 24:00.`
`When you think about it, isn't 24:00 a strange time?`
`{n}...It can be called 24:00, and it can also be called 0:00.`
`It's the hour at the culmination of the previous day, ...and at the same time, it is hour zero as the next day begins.`
`"............{f:5:Beatrice}!!"`
`Maria suddenly called out happily, and ran towards the darkness.`
`It was almost as though......{f:5:Beatrice} was somewhere in that darkness, and Maria was running up to her.`
`As I looked down the barrel of the rifle,`
` as Jessica hugged her mother's corpse,`
` as George‐aniki stood there shocked,`
` ......we gazed into the darkness...`
`Our eyes...fixed just in front of {f:5:Beatrice}'s portrait.`
`And there, Maria leapt into a hug...`
`...with the portrait's...`
`subject.`
`You've got to be kidding me,`
` ......this is...ridiculous, impossible...`
`...This madness can't possibly {i:be},`
` ...witches don't "exist", I won't accept it...!`
`Things like you must not "exist",`
` because this is a human world—you think I could accept something that's not human?! Never, I will never!!`
`I pulled hard on the rifle's lever; the cartridge was ejected, fell on the floor, and a new cartridge was loaded.`
`Then, I sighted the witch down the barrel...`
`Maria turned around.`
`{n}......Still clinging to the Golden Witch, she turned around.`
`"......Didn't I tell you it's meaningless?`
` ............Mere lead bullets are meaningless against {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......Humans are so stupid, aren't they?`
` ......Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi."`
`"I won't accept the existence of witches!!`
` Who are you?!!`
` Just try moving one step, just try moving one finger!!`
` I'll blast you away!!!"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi,`
` *giggle* *giggle* *giggle* *giggle* *giggle*"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*"`
`""Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!""`
`The laughter of the witch—no, the witches—was joined by the laughter of even the large clock in the hall...`
`It was probably telling us that the time was 24:00.`
`It was both a tone telling us that we had reached the culmination of this day, and a tone informing us that all had returned to nothing.`
`{i:The rules had specified that the witch would win when time ran out}.`
`".........Battler.`
` ...George onii‐chan and Jessica onee‐chan.`
` ......The journey...{0}has ended...{0}and the witch...{0}has revived...{0}you see?"`
`And {i:none shall be left alive.}`
`{e:070:The witch shall praise the wise, and bestow four treasures.`
`{n}{n}One shall be all of the Golden Land's gold.`
`{n}One resurrects all the dead people's souls.`
`{n}One even revives all the love they possessed.`
`{n}And one for the witch to eternally rest.`
`{n}{n}Rest in peace, my beloved witch, {f:5:Beatrice}}.`

`"Hey, everyone, good job finishing "Umineko no Naku Koro ni"!`
` Man, I still didn't have a clue what was going on when the story ended!"`
`"So just what happened?`
` Was that basically the "bad ending", where time runs out before the culprit can be exposed?"`
`"Uu.`
` Definitely a bad ending.`
` Uu."`
`"I think so too.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}'s letter, which Maria‐chan read on the first day, did tell us in advance to solve the riddle of the epitaph.`
` We were all so busy trying to protect ourselves and look for the culprit that we didn't even take a shot at it."`
`".........Yes, that's true.`
` If we had actually tried to solve the riddle, I'm sure things would have ended differently."`
`"I wonder about that.`
` Shannon‐chan, you did a good job too!"`
`"You don't have to be our waitress and serve tea.`
` After all, this is a wrap party.`
` As a group of people who met a horrible fate, let's all get along and lick each other's wou~~nds!`
` Licklickli~ck!!"`
`"Speaking of a horrible fate, Shannon beats the rest of us hands down, doesn't she?`
` She was such a beautiful character, so I thought she'd definitely survive until the very end,`
` but she was killed right in the beginning, and on top of that...what was it?`
` Half of her face was smashed, right?`
` That's the worst!"`
`"............That was my role, so, umm......there was no way around it..."`
`"...Nee‐san, it's nothing for you to worry about.`
` Judging by the final epilogue, even Milady and the others met with a considerably tragic end."`
`"Ahahaha... It seems that way.`
` I think I remember seeing this horrible picture, kind of like my entire body had been eaten apart and dismembered."`
`"Speaking of which, don't you think Kanon‐kun's last moments were the coolest?`
` Even though he had the tables turned on him, it was a showdown with the culprit, right?`
` It's a whole bunch better than our confusing last moments!"`
`".........Though, in the end, I was no match for her."`
`"Still, ...I think that Kanon‐kun's death was a big hint.`
` I mean, because of that, it became clear that a 19th person existed."`
`"Yes.`
` At that time, everyone's location was obvious.`
` So it was impossible for anyone other than some unknown 19th person to kill Kanon‐kun."`
`"Uu!`
` I did say it was {f:5:Beatrice} from the beginning, over and oooover.`
` Uu!"`
`"......I don't wanna believe it, but that does prove the culprit was a witch calling herself {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"That's right...`
` There were many strange things that happened which a human couldn't do..."`
`"Uu. Only a witch could do things like Auntie Eva's locked‐room murder.`
` A human couldn't do that!`
` Uu!"`
`"............Not only is it clear that a 19th person exists, but it is also obvious that this person holds a power that humans can't even imagine."`
`"In that case, I don't think there's anything wrong with calling this person {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"...We probably met at the very end.`
` ...Met with the Golden Witch."`
`"That's why I kept telling you {f:5:Beatrice} exists.`
` It all went bad because no one ever believed.`
` Uu!`
` Even one of my witch friends says miracles won't happen if you don't believe!`
` Uu!"`
`"That's right.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is generous to those who respect her."`
`"......I feel as if, despite the fact that horrible incidents kept occurring one after the other, Maria‐sama wasn't in danger from {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama until the end."`
`"Maria did believe in {f:5:Beatrice} from the very beginning.`
` ...But then, so did Kanon‐kun and the others, so how do you explain why they were all killed?"`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama probably had her reasons."`
`"If the epitaph poem represented {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's resurrection ritual, then she needed many sacrifices.`
` ......He must simply have been designated to be one of those."`
`"...Shannon‐chan, you met a horrible end...`
` At the very least, I wish your death could have been more peaceful and pretty."`
`".........Umm, well, ...it's not like it hurt...`
` Besides,`
` as you can see, right now, I'm perfectly fine, so don't worry."`
`Shannon proved this by stroking her cheek which had been crushed during the story, and everyone laughed out loud, smiling.`
`"Well, it feels a bit weird saying this, ...but I was sure this story would be in the standard mystery genre.`
` I'm a little surprised to find out that it's fantasy.`
` After all, a story revolving around an inheritance, set on a Western‐style mansion shut away on an isolated island, ...I thought that was the classic formula for mysteries."`
`"......Uu.`
` It's not fantasyyyy!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} "exiiists"!`
` Uu."`
`".........Yes, we know.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama does "exist"."`
`"That's right.`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama does "exist"."`
`"...I hate to admit it, but I've got no choice.`
` Because it's obvious that a 19th person, a witch, was involved...!"`
`"She pulled off many things that would be impossible for humans.`
` During the story, we thought of all kinds of things, trying to deny that."`
`"...But now I can say it clearly.`
` Each one of them, all of them, were crimes impossible for a human.`
` ......Those crimes would be impossible to carry out unless it was the witch {f:5:Beatrice} using all of the power magic could provide."`
`"The culprit was a witch.`
` That point is perfectly clear.`
` Long live {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` Hahahahahaha."`
`"Uu.`
` Everyone believed.`
` I'm happy.`
` Uu!"`
`"......Gods and witches might seem terrifying to people who are frightened of them,`
` but I think they must have affection for those who believe in and respect them."`
`"............I think it's just as you say."`
`"So, now we're all done with playing with murder cases.`
` Now's the time to pull ourselves together and try hard to solve the riddle of the epitaph, just like {f:5:Beatrice} said, right?"`
`"Uu!`
` Agreed!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} will definitely be happy."`
`"Hahahahaha...`
` We all ignored that letter during the story, after all."`
`"......Even though it was thrust right in front of us, we almost completely ignored it.`
` I kind of feel sorry for {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"I have a memo with the epitaph on it!`
` Let's all solve the puzzle, let's all solve the puzzle...!"`
`"This story probably went wrong ever since that time."`
`".........That may be so.`
` Maybe we should have tried solving the epitaph's riddle from the beginning, like {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama said."`
`"Well, it's a little late now.`
` Even so, let's try solving it now and see if the witch forgives us.`
` Let's go, let's try to solve the riddle of the epitaph.`
` ......Here we are, "Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old"..."`
`As Maria put her notebook on the table, and opened to the page where the epitaph was written,`
` everyone peered closely at it, and had fun and lively discussion as they started guessing this and that about the riddle.`
`Surrounded by the smell of the black tea and the freshly baked vanilla cookies, they spent the time comfortably and happily......`
`"..................Wait a second, you guys."`
`Battler said, in a tone that ruined the mood.`
`His expression looked a little unhappy.`
`{n}What could he not like about all of this fun?`
`"...I've been listening to you guys, and—why did you all stop thinking?`
` Why are you so sure that the witch was behind all of this?`
` ...Don't you realize that stuff like that doesn't exist?"`
`With just those words, ...the happy atmosphere of the tea party disappeared in no time at all.`
`George and Jessica.`
` And Shannon and Kanon.`
` And Maria.`
`......All of them stared blankly, wondering why Battler was saying such weird things.`
`Even the foolish and arrogant Battler noticed he had said the wrong thing.`
`"...W‐.........well, come on.`
` Isn't it clear that these crimes were impossible for a human?"`
`"Y‐yeah, yeah!`
` ...None of the cases would have been possible for a human."`
`"That's right...`
` After all, wasn't it full of things that you couldn't explain using humans...?"`
`"...I don't understand what you're saying, Battler‐sama."`
`"I, I'm the one who doesn't have a clue what {i:you guys} are talking about!`
` Isn't it obvious that humans committed these crimes?`
` There's obviously no such thing as witches, right...?"`
`"Th‐...then...`
` ...What about when I was killed in the storehouse, and something horrible was done to half of my face?`
` ......If the culprit was human, how could they have accomplished it...?"`
`"...Well...`
` ......I mean...`
` It's hard to imagine how they could've done something that awful."`
`"But that was the rose garden storehouse, right?`
` I'm sure there were plenty of weird tools in there.`
` Don't ask me, but...they could've used some electrical tool like a grinder or an electric saw, couldn't they?"`
`"...............Th‐`
`.........that's......`
`...umm..."`
`"Okay, Battler...`
` Then how do you explain Grandfather's disappearance from the locked room of his study...?`
` Grandfather disappeared all of a sudden even though the door was sealed, remember...?"`
`"We talked about that during the story, too.`
` It's not impossible that Grandfather used some trick to fool the receipt.`
` It's also possible that he went out the window, or fell out the window, and Aunt Natsuhi locked it from the inside.`
` I could think of a bunch of tricks you could use without relying on magic...you see?"`
`"............Th‐`
`......that makes sense, but........."`
`"In that case, Battler‐kun,`
` how do you explain the way my parents were killed in the guest room?`
` The door was sealed by the lock and the chain.`
` Naturally, the windows were sealed too.`
` How would you suggest a human could have killed my parents?"`
`"...Well,`
` ......you're right, we did have to leave that trick alone during the story.`
` Anyways, there's a good chance that the culprit had the key at least.`
` And it was possible to look in through the crack of the door that the chain allowed."`
`"......This is extremely far‐fetched, but it is possible that some device was used through that crack.`
` ...Or maybe they brought something out through the crack...?"`
`"......Hmmmm, well, even though chains are incredibly simple, they're a big factor in constructing a locked room...`
` .........But authors have done almost every possible locked‐room trick there is to do by now.`
` If you bought just a few locked‐room mysteries from some bookstore or other, you could probably find some trick that would fit perfectly."`
`"......Anyways, I can't think of one now...but I can state for certain that a human could manage it somehow if they tried hard enough."`
`"Isn't that argument horribly irrational...?`
` It's just ridiculous to claim that it's possible for a human to do something, even though you can't explain how..."`
`"......Why is that ridiculous?`
` Why did all of you stop thinking?`
` Even if it looks impossible, it has to be doable.`
` Doesn't it always work like that?"`
`"Battler, you're the one being ridiculous.`
` ......If you think a human could've done it, try explaining how.`
` You can't, can you?"`
`"And just because I can't explain it, that immediately makes the culprit a witch?`
` With that argument, all of the unsolved crimes in the world could be resolved by saying a witch is the culprit!"`
`"......Battler, you're sidestepping the issue, and you aren't explaining anything.`
` ...We are saying "A human can't do it.`
` Therefore the culprit is something that isn't human.`
` And that something is a witch."`
` And yet you keep arbitrarily deciding that witches are impossible even though you can't explain anything."`
`"......Kihihihihihihihihihihihi, it's almost like humanity was during the dark ages.`
` Like those fools who claimed that the Earth couldn't possibly be spinning,`
` that the heavens had to be spinning around the Earth, even though they couldn't say how."`
`"...............Th‐...that kind of argument kinda pisses me off.`
` So this is basically what you're trying to say.`
` ...If I can't explain how a human could do it,`
` ...then I must accept that the culprit is the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"............It's not like we're forcing you.`
` We were just wondering on what basis you can say such nonsense."`
`"N‐...nonsense...`
`......`
` ......H‐...hey, is what I've been saying really that weird?!"`
`"Am I the one who's crazy?!`
` You guys are really starting to freak me out!"`
`"......Battler‐sama.`
` When I died in the boiler room, I was killed by a 19th person who shouldn't exist."`
`"...Can you explain how a human could have done that?`
` At that time, the locations of the 18 were well known.`
` Even so, I was killed."`
`"We talked about that in the story as well...!`
` Kumasawa baa‐chan, for example.`
` She said that she followed right after you'd headed down into the boiler room, but for all we know, that might've been a lie."`
`"She might've entered the boiler room with you and caught you by surprise!`
` Or maybe, when you stepped into the boiler room, you activated some kind of trap, one that might have been set up to hit you with one of those icepicks."`
`"After all, the stink of Grandfather's body was coming from the incinerator.`
` Someone was bound to come, so all the culprit had to do was set up a trap, and it would be more than possible for them to stay away from that place and create an alibi for the time of your death...!"`
`"......You talk about a trap in the boiler room...but what kind of trap?"`
`"That's right.`
` After that happened, we all immediately ran over to the boiler room.`
` But we didn't find any kind of weird device like that!"`
`"......That is correct.`
` Battler‐sama, what kind of trap do you claim I was killed with...?"`
`"Well,`
` .........I don't know that.`
` ...But anyway, they must have pulled off some kind of trap, or maybe someone is lying, or...`
`or what about this?!"`
`"Kanon‐kun, what if the whole thing was just you playacting?!`
` Th‐that's it, you were playacting!!`
` Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi were also playacting.`
` They made the locked room themselves, and were only pretending to be dead!"`
`".........Battler...`
` .........Has your...`
`head been...`
`feeling alright......?"`
`"......Umm, .........should I bring some cold drinks...?"`
`"D‐don't look at me with those pitying eyes, I'm not saying something that crazy...`
` I'm just pointing out possibilities that could have been used as tricks, alright?"`
`"Look, isn't one of the clichés in mystery stories that the victims aren't really dead?!"`
`"Clichés...?"`
`"O‐okay, so.`
` When Kanon‐kun was killed, we really did know for sure where the rest of us were.`
` And let's assume that Kumasawa baa‐chan wasn't lying."`
`"But that only holds true for the survivors.`
` ......If the culprit pretended to be dead, placed themselves together with the real victims to hide themselves, and then acted on their own later, then everything would be explained!"`
`"............I guess...`
` Are you trying to say that Auntie Eva or one of the rest of them was the culprit...?`
` But Doctor Nanjo confirmed everyone's death as a doctor, remember?"`
`"......That's right.`
` Doctor Nanjo checked all of the victims.`
` ...Battler‐sama, for your theory to work, wouldn't Doctor Nanjo have to be one of the culprits too?"`
`"Uh, yeah, that's right!!`
` Once you consider that Doctor Nanjo might have been one of the culprits and faked the proclamation of death, the whole story changes...!`
` See, that's also a cliché in mystery novels, isn't it?!!"`
`"......But Doctor Nanjo was also killed..."`
`"Umm, .........about that...`
` ...That's right, Doctor Nanjo faked his death!"`
`"I mean, there wasn't anyone except Doctor Nanjo who could examine corpses properly, and everyone was really confused then anyway.`
` We didn't have any spare time to check and see if he still had a pulse!`
` With this theory, any one of the dead people could have been walking around!"`
`".........I think that it would have been hard for the six of us who died in the beginning to do that...`
` ......After all, the shutter was closed, ...and there was a padlock that couldn't have been opened from the inside..."`
`"Yeah.`
` Mom was holding onto that key.`
` So was Mom one of the culprits too?"`
`"...Aaaaaaah, wait a sec, ...`
`maybe it was impossible for the first six, but in the case of Aniki's parents, the door was only locked on the outside.`
` So they could have opened it from the inside...`
` ...That's right, after we left the room, maybe they jumped out the window and got to the boiler room first!"`
`"Is, ......is that too much...?!`
` Or maybe Doctor Nanjo made a mistake when examining the corpses?!"`
`"Look, he said it himself, right?`
` He said that there's a very high probability of making a mistake when examining corpses!`
` They disguised it well, or prepared a substitute corpse or something, and faked their own death!!`
` Let's leave the method or trick they used for later...and...you see, it's not that hard to deny a 19th person existed!"`
`"Much less a {i:witch}!`
` At least that much is completely impossible!!"`
`"............I don't know why you've been trying so stubbornly to say that one of us is the culprit.`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi, in other words, you want to suspect one of your relatives...?"`
`"That's not it...`
` It's just, uh, I can't easily accept that a 19th person existed...and even if one did, I think we should construct our argument from the point of view that the culprit was a human—`
`witches are something you only start talking about in desperation, at the very end, after everything else has been disproved, that's what I'm trying to say."`
`"I mean, come on, there's no way witches exist, right?!`
` Why have you all just been casually accepting that the culprit was a witch?"`
`"I think it's great how your family love makes you hate the thought that someone close to you is a murderer.`
` But is it alright to just brush things over like that?!`
` Don't you want to find the detestable culprit who killed so many people?!"`
`"Aniki, you want to avenge your parents, don't you?!`
` Jessica, you want to avenge Kanon‐kun, and Kanon‐kun, you want to avenge Shannon‐chan, right?!`
` Shannon‐chan, you should at least want to know who it was that killed you."`
`"Why have you all totally surrendered and decided that the culprit was a witch?!`
` What's wrong with all of you?!"`
`The foolish and short‐tempered Battler tried to force his ignorance on the others by yelling at them.`
`...However, everyone just looked at him pityingly, silently watching over him.`
`Then, the wise Maria laughed, and pointed out Battler's mistake for him.`
`"...............Kihihihihihihihihi.`
` ...We're just astounded.`
` ......All you've been doing is repeating this nonsense, thinking you've figured something out, Battler."`
`"......So what?`
` And?`
` How would a human do it?`
` Concretely?`
` Whenever we ask you those questions, all you say is "I just can't think of anything now" or "with some kind of device" or something, using abstract words to run away and evade the topic."`
`"......In fact, I want to ask {i:you}, Battler.`
` Why don't {i:you} believe in {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` She "exists", so why don't you believe?"`
`"Because she doesn't "exist"!`
` Witches don't "exist"!!`
` There's no way!!"`
`......He was almost like a stubborn child refusing for no reason.`
`The pitying gazes quietly blanketed Battler, but they didn't reach his stubborn heart.`
`"............You're acting just totally like a kid who can't have his way..."`
`"......Battler‐sama.`
` I understand your feelings, but..."`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama does "exist"."`
`"Battler‐kun... Why don't you believe?`
` Look at how much circumstantial evidence there is."`
`"I don't accept the argument that if I can't explain it it's all the witch.`
` If you don't know how a light bulb shines, if you don't know the principle, does that mean it's all magic?"`
`"It doesn't, does it!`
` There's nothing that can't be explained without magic!!`
` All of this about witches and magic is just abdication of thought!`
` You just surrendered and gave up because you don't understand what happened!`
` I'm right, aren't I!"`
`".....................Ki‐hihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` ...Well, I'm not surprised,`
` ......but it looks like you're the only one who's not going to believe no matter what."`
`"......If even a single person doesn't believe, the "miracle" won't occur.`
` ......So, if you don't rethink your ignorant theories, the miracle, ......the magic won't be completed."`
`"Heheh...`
` Nowww I see.`
` ......I finally figured it out.`
` ...So in other words, you guys want to get me to say that the witch exists, don't you?`
` If everyone accepts this lie, it will become "the truth".`
` ......That's what this is all about, isn't it?!"`
`"......Well, too bad.`
` This is the one place I'm going to have to say too bad, that's no goddamn good at all. I refuse.`
` ......{i:You guys are all pressing me, and that is exactly why it's no goddamn good.}"`
`".....................Why?"`
`"Sorry, but why don't you let me flip over the chessboard one last time...?`
` If you want to force me to accept that there's a witch, there's a really easy way."`
`"......And it's not the roundabout way of saying "humans can't do it so it must be a witch"!`
` All you have to do is actually show it to me, the way a witch did it with magic."`
`"Furthermore, what Maria said earlier is what will really dig her grave.`
` ......You said that if even one person doesn't believe, a "miracle" won't occur."`
`"But real miracles happen whether people believe in them or not!`
` Even if I alone don't believe!!`
` So any miracles or magic or witches that exist only because I believe in them are downright lies!!"`
`"................................."`
`The uneasy mood following Battler's ignorant rant...`
`was thoughtfully blown away by a very refreshing and light laugh.`
`Whose laugh...?`
` Battler was surprised by that voice which he had never heard before.`
`When he looked at George and Jessica, at Shannon and Kanon and Maria, he noticed that they had suddenly gone respectfully silent.`
`"..................{f:5:Beatrice}."`
`".........Wonderful.`
` ...I haven't been able to meet such a charming human for quite some time."`
`"Wh‐`
`..................who...`
`......are you..."`
`"......So you don't even know the host of the tea party to which you were invited.`
` ......Simply wonderful.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"...You are graced by the presence of the Golden Witch who has lived for a thousand years, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"I am most honored to see you, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama..."`
`"......Please forgive Battler‐kun's ranting."`
`"Th‐this guy's just stubborn, and, umm, he still doesn't understand the situation he's in......!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...`
` It is fine.`
` ......After a thousand years, most witches get tired of living.`
` Once in a while, it is nice to meet a man with backbone such as yourself."`
`"...............It is quite an honor to be present when {f:5:Beatrice} shows herself, Battler."`
`"......Heh,`
` .........heh‐heh‐heh‐heh...!!`
` Now this...`
` ......This is some shit.`
` ...Are you really that desperate to make me believe that a witch,`
` ...that a 19th person is the culprit...?"`
`"This is starting to get interesting...!`
` And it's no goddamn good...!!`
` You must be an illusion of the witch {f:5:Beatrice} who's asserted by Maria and the others."`
`".........And only when everyone believes in your existence will you finally be allowed to exist.`
` ...You're that kind of a fictional being, right?`
` That's why you want to make me believe too.`
` {i:You can't exist, because I alone don't believe in you}.`
` .........Isn't that right?!"`
`".........Your power of understanding isn't bad for a common mortal who knows nothing of magic.`
` .........I see, it seems that you were born with a strong magic‐resisting power."`
`"......The natural enemy of us witches.`
` ...No matter how much we tip you upside down and shake you,`
` {i:you will never believe in us}.`
` {i:Therefore, magic will fall short against you}.`
` ...That attitude of yours makes a great deal of sense.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"I've got no clue what you're saying, ihihi!`
` It's very kind of you to go to all of the trouble of showing yourself to us,`
` but I don't believe you exist in the slightest."`
`"It's true that many strange things happened during those two days.`
` Like Maria said earlier, even though I think that all of the tricks could be explained, I still can't lay out the practical details of each one.`
` But that doesn't mean I'll surrender."`
`"I'm different from the rest of them, see?`
` I'll never argue that it was the work of a witch just because I can't explain it."`
`".........My interest in you grows deeper.`
` It will be worth my time to break you..."`
`"......You're just the kind of man I'd love to force into praising my name......`
` You're just the kind of man I'd love to force into kissing my toes.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Talk all the nonsense you want...!`
` I deny you exist.`
` All of the events can be explained with "human tricks"...!!`
` There's no room for even a speck of magic or witches!!"`
`"Wonderful!`
` ......This is the perfect form of diversion from a thousand years of boredom."`
`"Then let me ask you.`
` A short while ago, you said that using the crack in the door would be sufficient to kill Eva and Hideyoshi, right...?`
` Explain how you would do that using your human tricks."`
`"......Heh.`
` Suddenly jumping right into the toughest part, are you?`
` ...Does that mean that this is the trick you're proudest of?`
` Miss {i:Real Culprit}?"`
`{f:5:Beatrice} shook her golden pipe,`
` and seven colors of gentle smoke trailed out of the end.`
`...The smoke quickly obscured the surroundings,`
` ......and they were suddenly in the hallway of the mansion.`
`In front of their eyes, a slightly opened door, secured by a chain...`
`Yes, it was the entrance to the room where Eva and Hideyoshi had been killed.`
`"......N‐nice trick..."`
`"Now then.`
` Show me what you would do through this small crack, "Battler"."`
`"Erk............`
` ......Th‐they probably had some device to shoot those "icepicks".`
` If they used that......"`
`"How would you aim at Eva over on the bed when you can't see that far through this crack?`
` ......And how would you reach Hideyoshi, in the bathroom with the door shut...?"`
`".................................Dammit.........`
` ...There is a crack...`
` There should be some way......"`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` If you can't think of one, allow me."`
`"......Oh?`
` Go on, how would a great witch do it, then...`
` C'mon, let's see your little trick..."`
`"............Battler, you're being rude to {f:5:Beatrice}..."`
`"It is fine, quite fine.`
` What a charming man.`
` ...It will make it all the more enjoyable to break him."`
`"......Heh!`
` You really want to make me kiss your toes that much...?!`
` Only if I surrender!`
` But watch... I'll definitely expose this trick, and then I'll make you kiss my ass instead!"`
`"...............*cackle*.`
` What a charming man.`
` I shall remember that promise.`
` ...Weak witches kiss the behinds of demons to gain power.`
` Because there is no greater oath of total submission.`
` It is words like those that give me the desire to subjugate you.`
` .........*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`Paying no mind to Battler's crude ranting, {f:5:Beatrice} once again waved her golden pipe.`
`......Yes, for that golden pipe was her precious magic wand.`
`"Come, arise, children.`
` I am the guide of Purgatory.`
` Wield the seven stakes, which forgave the deadly sins."`
`Guided by those magic words, which sounded like a psalm, seven stakes gathered.`
`{n}...They were the stakes of the seven demons symbolizing the deadly sins of sinful people.`
`"Beelzebub and Asmodeus.`
` Come, forgive their sins.`
` Release the spirits of the sinners...!"`
`"Wha...?!"`
`The stakes of Beelzebub and Asmodeus responded to {f:5:Beatrice}'s call.`
`The two demonic stakes burst into motion like billiard balls struck by a cue, and were sucked in through the crack of the door.`
`Then came the sound of them deflecting repeatedly off the walls of the room, making a sound like a woodpecker.`
`And finally, a pleasant sound could be heard.`
`......It was a small, satisfying sound, like the one heard when someone is chopping firewood and the falling ax neatly and easily slices through the wood.`
`It was the sound of the two stakes burying themselves deep into Eva and Hideyoshi's foreheads.`
`"............Right through the middle.`
` Want to see...?"`
`They had definitely heard two sounds like someone's forehead being split open.`
`Battler wasn't permitted to see it, since he was on the other side of the door,`
` but those two had died again, and this second time, they lay not an inch apart from where they had lain the last time, with the exact same blood spray as before.`
`"Y‐............you must be crazy...`
` Th‐......this is insane......!`
` Y‐you can't kill people with this insanity!!!"`
`"I most certainly can.`
` ......I can kill them just like this...!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`Suddenly, they were no longer in the hall, but seated at the tea party they had started from.`
`......Everyone but Battler was sitting meekly, ......but Kanon was moaning, fresh blood dangling from his mouth.`
`{n}Such bad manners for a tea party.`
`Satan's stake was buried deep into Kanon's chest.`
`"..................u...`
`...............gah...`
`......"`
`"Ka‐......Kanon‐kun......`
`Kanon‐kun!!`
` Daa......damn iiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`Battler was the only one getting agitated.`
`George, Jessica, Shannon—everyone else was meekly hanging their heads like students being told off by their teacher.`
`"...Kanon, you were captivated by a trifling anger and tried to disturb my banquet.`
` ......Your deadly sin is being easily captivated by anger.`
` Cleanse yourself, regret, and do it over."`
`"......{f:5:at}`
`......{f:5:rice}......`
`......sa...ma..............."`
`"B‐...{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...`
` Please, forgive him...`
` I think Kanon‐kun has repented enough......!"`
`"Wonderful.`
` I am generous to those who respect me.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"Cut the crap!!!`
` Don't think for a second that this piss‐poor show of theatrics will convince me of your sorry existence!`
` Like hell you're a thousand‐year‐old witch!`
` Your tricks aren't a thousand years old, at best they're the accumulation of a hundred years of clichés that the mystery world created!"`
`"They're not magic!!`
` No way are they magic!!`
` All of these crimes can be explained with "human tricks"!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` You would explain my thousand years with a hundred years by humans...?`
` Good, good, that's why I like you...!"`
`"...............Foolish Battler...`
` Kihhihihihihihihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi...!"`
`"......Stop yourself, Battler‐kun...`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is someone you can't...`
`go...against......"`
`"............nn...`
`......u...`
`............u..."`
`Shannon started moaning, holding her cheek.`
`{n}...Maybe she had a toothache.`
`But it didn't look anything like a toothache.`
`{n}......A slight redness spread across the cheek Shannon was holding.`
`It looked like that redness was causing Shannon unbearable pain...`
`She started to press her nails into her cheek, and drops of sweat appeared all over her body...`
`"...Shannon...`
`Shannon...!!`
` Hang in there...hang in there!"`
`"What's going on?!`
` Damn it, what the hell is that red stuff...?!"`
`It expanded rapidly, covering half of Shannon's face...`
`...Then, the stupid dunce Battler finally realized...`
`"Ple‐please, Battler‐kun...!`
` Please believe in {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...!`
` I beg you...!!`
` Aaaaaaah, because you won't believe,`
` because you won't believe, aaaaaaaaaah...`
`the magic is,`
` ......the magic is wearing off!!!!!!!!"`
`For the first time in his life, ......Battler heard that sound, like a pomegranate splitting.`
`The red spray even landed on Battler's face...`
`How sad—Shannon's face had been split in half, ...and her last horrible moments in that storehouse had been repeated once again.`
`"U...uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, Shannon, Shannon!!`
` Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`"G...ghhhkkk, damn you, damn youuuuuuu!`
` Stop it, stop it, stop it!!`
` Don't humiliate the dead, don't humiliate the deeeeeaaaaad!!"`
`"Uuuu......gah.........eeeggh!!"`
` This time, red patterns began to spread across George's entire body...`
` It was like the beautiful cloud drawn by milk when it is poured into black tea.`
` They slowly spread out and extended across his entire body.`
`......As they grew more saturated in color, they seemed to give George increasingly greater pain.`
`Looking at those bizarre patterns, ......Battler was petrified as he frantically thought with his pitifully clumsy imagination...`
`about the nature of the strange deaths that George and the others had experienced...`
`Before long, ......that redness reached the nearby Jessica as well......`
`"Gah,`
` .........ee...`
`......ack...`
`.........hh!!"`
`"St‐stop stop stop!!!`
` What did Aniki do,`
` what did Jessica do,`
` just STOOOOOOP!!!"`
`"Ba‐`
`......Battler......`
` ......Don‐`
`...don't let the witch...`
`break your spirit......!`
` ......Deny her,`
` erase her...`
` As, ......as long as at least one person denies her,`
` she's an illusion that can't exist......!`
` Uuuuughhh, gghhh!!"`
`"A‐are you OK, Jessica?!!`
` Whah, A‐Aniki?!?!"`
`George was no longer shaped like a person.`
` ...He looked like the pile of leftover meat after the good, delicious meat has been scraped off to be cooked.`
`...The only traces left of his time as a human were the shape of his lower jaw and rib cage.`
`And it was clear that Jessica, who was covered with a steadily strengthening redness, was approaching the same fate.`
`"............Uu.`
` ...Battler.`
` ......Quick, believe in {f:5:Beatrice}...`
` .........If you don't,`
` .........everyone's magic...`
`......will wear off..."`
`"Ma‐Maria, it's all over your body, too......!!!"`
`"I resurrect all the dead with my magic.`
` ......But as long as you don't believe, that magic will hold no true power.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` But I'm sure that a man of your caliber won't be broken by something like this, right...?"`
`"Ba‐`
`...Battler......!`
` We...`
`...didn't want to doubt our friends...`
` We refused to face reality,`
` ...and gave in to the witch......!`
` But...`
`I know you...`
` ......I know you won't...`
`...give in to that witch......!`
` Geh...`
`ggghh...`
`......gggggghhkkkkkkk!!!"`
`"Jessica, JESSICAAAAA, waaaaAAAAAAAaaaAAAahh!!"`
`How sad—Jessica met the same end.`
`{n}...Just like George, she ended up like a butcher's leftovers.`
`Broken apart, melted, and all mixed up, so you couldn't tell which was George and which was Jessica anymore.`
`"...............Battler.`
` Don't cry.`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice} will resurrect the dead over and over.`
` So there's nothing to be sad about...`
` ......So,`
` ............even if we die, we're still...`
`......just......`
`fine—"`
`The redness began eating into the whole of Maria's body...`
` When he saw this, the foolish Battler screamed out loud.`
`"You bitch, you won't get away with this, I'll never forgive you!!`
` You call yourself a witch?! You call this magic?!`
` I'll deny you with every last fiber of my being...!!`
` I don't care what happens, there's not a chance in hell I'm ever gonna accept you!!`
` If you want me as an enemy that bad, I'm gonna make sure you get what's coming to you!!"`
`"I'll get you for this, you're gonna pay for this, you're going to fucking pay!!!!`
` You're gonna regret making Ushiromiya Battler your enemy!!`
` I'll deny you no matter what!!`
` Every last impossible thing, I'll explain it all with "humans"!!!`
` I'll erase every cell of you from this world!!!"`
`"You! You speak well, "Battler"...!`
` That's the kind of thing that can divert me from my thousand years of boredom!"`
`"Come, explain.`
` Try explaining it all with your so‐called "human tricks"!`
` And learn how lowly humans are!!`
` Let's see you try to use what humanity has built up in a hundred years to oppose my thousand!!`
` It will make forcing you to submit all the more enjoyable...!!"`
`"So tell me, "Battler"!`
` What about Maria's letter?`
` How the six were killed?`
` The shutter?`
` The receipt seal?`
` The locked room with the chain?`
` Kanon in the boiler room?`
` Genji and the others in the parlor?!`
` Natsuhi's suicide?!`
` The riddle of the epitaph?!`
` The location of the hidden gold?!"`
`"Come, Battler, why don't you show me the power of "humans"?!`
` Fuhahahahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!!"`
`"OoooooOOOOOOooooooooooOOOOOOOOohh!!!"`
`"...What sort of tea should I prepare next?`
` You have free choice of any brand that ever was throughout the ages."`
`"......Dried plum tea.`
` ......Those dried plums that go for 200 yen a pack."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...!`
` ...For a thousand years I have been fond of black tea, but I did not know of such a thing.`
` ...I will never tire of living in this world."`
`"...............Beato.`
` You don't have to display such hostility.`
` ...I am just a wandering witch.`
` I didn't come with the intention of violating the rules of your territory."`
`"...*cackle*cackle*, there is not even a sliver of hostility.`
` ...I am just terribly concerned about seeing that the legendary witch, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, is well attended to."`
`".........You misunderstand.`
` I am powerless.`
` Before a witch such as you, with the dreadful power to kill a person a hundred times over, I am completely powerless."`
`"That a "powerless" witch like you possesses a power that none can approach is what is truly terrifying.`
` After all, you fended off that Great Witch, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, as a lone piece."`
`"......I only won an endurance contest.`
` She simply got tired."`
`"That is not what Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} said, though.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*, too much humility can be unseemly, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}."`
`"......That girl has a dreadful power.`
` ............The power to kill a person "without fail".`
` However, there is no such thing as "without fail" in this world.`
` Just as, no matter how many times you divide 1, you can never make it 0."`
`"That girl has the power to bring that closer and closer to "virtually zero", and give rise to a "virtually absolute certainty".`
` ......I hope I never have to fight such a terrifying witch again."`
`"However, you have a power that manifests without fail "except for zero".`
` ......Although you say there is no such thing as "without fail" in this world, you possess an infallible power yourself.`
` ......How very terrifying, *cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"......The power to kill a person "endlessly"...`
` ...I think you're the more terrifying one."`
`"Such jests.`
` ......From your point of view, mine is but a trifling power.`
` The phrase "flattery will get you nowhere" was made for this situation."`
`"......Call it payment for my stay here.`
` ...I am a fleeing traveler who crosses the {ruby:kakera:fragments}, continually running from boredom.`
` ......I simply came around because I'd heard that you'd started something interesting.`
` Rest assured, I will leave of my own accord as soon as you start to bore me."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...!`
` I am deeply and humbly delighted to have the great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} as an observer.`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` And so, your impression?"`
`"............{f:5:Lambdadelta} is terrifying because of her cruelty; however, she was a girl I could understand.`
` ...You do seem to possess affection, but I can't understand you at all.`
` That's why you're much more terrifying than her."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!`
` I am fickle by nature.`
` Do forgive me.`
` ...Besides, I believe you also enjoy trusting your fate to the roll of fickle dice—is that not so, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}?"`
`"......When I roll the dice, I have a roll I clearly want to get.`
` Unlike you.`
` You, on the other hand, anticipate all outcomes."`
`"And, whatever the roll might be, you're never disappointed.`
` Whatever roll the dice show you, you are satisfied "without fail".`
` .........In that sense, you far surpass me."`
`".........You're one I really don't want to fight with.`
` Inside of you, there's nothing but zero.`
` That's why I can't win against you with my power.`
` ...The worst matchup.`
` ......Perhaps {f:5:Lambdadelta}, on the other hand, has a good matchup against you.`
` Since she would likely be able to kill your "endlessness"."`
`"*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` ......Truly, tea is best drunk in the company of a witch.`
` It's never boring.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"......Good to hear.`
` Boredom is the sole poison that can kill me.`
` ......So, don't kill me, alright?`
` Lady {f:5:Beatrice}, Endless Witch."`
`"If such is your wish, I shall show you an even better time."`
`"......In that case, wouldn't it be best if I brought the next chessboard in right away?`
` It seems that the next tale would do more for you than a refill of tea."`
`"................................."`
`"Just wait for a moment.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*!"`
`............Something troublesome seems to have taken a liking to you.`
`I'd really like to lend you my power, but as you just heard, that girl's power and mine have a very bad matchup.`
` Unfortunately for you.`
`But you really are pitiful, so I'll help you out just a bit.`
`First of all, about that girl.`
`She does have an existence that goes by the name of {f:5:Beatrice}, but that doesn't necessarily mean that she is "a woman with an individual body".`
`Do you understand what I mean?`
` In other words, she's not some {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` Her existence is a personification of the rules of this world.`
`To beat her, you have to expose the rules of this world and unravel them.`
`This can be likened to learning the rules of chess by watching a few games.`
`First, take a good look over the chessboard.`
`And notice the movements and roles of the pieces.`
`Then, look for the conditions required to win at her game.`
`When you've managed to reveal all of these things, her heart will be exposed.`
`After that, you can rip it apart or crush it as you please.`
`......I am being quite generous.`
` Back when I was once human, it took me a hundred years to realize even this much.`
`This is my meager farewell gift to you, the pitiful one captured by Beato. It is like a single spoon.`
`A spoon can be used for more than just drinking soup.`
`You can use it to dig through the prison you're locked in, or as a weapon to gouge the witch's eyes out.`
`......Of course, you can also use the spoon to continually sip the watery soup inside your eternal prison.`
`......Don't get the wrong idea—I have no intention of becoming your ally.`
`I do feel empathy for you, but I won't help you.`
`...It's like how someone sitting in front of a television cannot reach the characters on screen no matter how much they yell at them.`
`{a:c:`
`THAT'S HOW YOU CAN TELL I AM A WITCH, YOU SEE?}`
`I intend to enjoy the endless tales that Beato is going to weave until I tire of them.`
` But I'm sure that alone won't hold my interest.`
`......That's why I'll lend you my power.`
` It's all so that I don't get tired of this.`
`I am the cruelest witch in the world.`
`No matter who the opponent may be, I'll absolutely make them surrender.`
`...Even if that's {f:5:Beatrice}, the Endless Witch...`
`You are my game piece.`
` Give it your best shot.`
`I'll give you advice sometimes, out of her sight.`
`Don't bore me, okay......?`
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*......`
`"Look, George‐sama!`
` They're so cute, look, look!"`
`Shannon found a pair of hammerhead sharks playfully swimming in the tank,`
` and made a fuss like a grade schooler seeing an aquarium for the first time.`
`"Yeah, they're really cute.`
` I almost want to eat them."`
`"I, I'd feel so sorry for them...`
` Did you know?`
` I hear that the only people in the world who come to an aquarium and say that the fish look delicious are the Japanese."`
`"Is that so?`
` ...I'm sure even Americans and Italians would want to eat these."`
`"...Uh,`
` ...um......`
`err..."`
`"Those clothes look good on you.`
` Really."`
`Shannon embraced her chest with both hands in embarrassment.`
`{n}...She apparently felt like she was being made fun of for wearing these clothes that she wasn't used to.`
`Even though George's face didn't show it, the truth was that even he was surprised at how easily those tremendous words had left his lips,`
` and he was as embarrassed as Shannon on the inside.`
`However, when he saw how embarrassed Shannon was,`
` he started to feel as though he was teasing the girl he liked,`
` and instead of embarrassment, ticklish amusement welled up in him.`
`......Wait, that isn't just a feeling.`
`{n}...I really am teasing the girl I like.`
`It pains me to admit it,`
` ......but I used to think that such embarrassing expressions had fallen so far out of use they no longer showed up even in manga.`
`On the contrary, if I'd seen a couple acting like that, I'd have felt like throwing rocks at them.`
`However, even if rocks were thrown at us now,`
` I'm sure they would be just like confetti celebrating us.`
`Now, I can't even remember those lonely days...`
`when I felt jealous of couples who were completely oblivious to their surroundings.`
`To use an old‐fashioned phrase, these would be truly rose‐colored days...`
`I was so entranced that I no longer even noticed the big tank of the world's largest aquarium.`
`Instead, I saw only Shannon happily playing with the fish, all her changing emotions showing on her face.`
`"...It's amazing, isn't it......?`
` It's my first time seeing a tank large enough for a whale to swim in."`
`"I heard that this tank is the biggest selling point here.`
` And that it's the biggest in the whole world."`
`"Is that so?`
` That's amazing.`
` ......It's really wonderful.`
` It doesn't even look like a tank at all, but rather like they sliced off a part of the sea with a knife and brought it here."`
`"It does, doesn't it?`
` This is a splendid little sea."`
`Despite its size, I hadn't thought of the tank as anything more than a tank.`
`That's why I thought her expression about slicing off a part of the sea with a knife was so interesting.`
`No matter how far humans broaden their experiences, in the end, they can only hold a single personal worldview.`
` Maybe that's why it's so interesting to interact with someone who has a different worldview.`
`I said that to her honestly.`
`{n}And she responded:`
`"Certainly, this might not be the real sea.`
` ...But, if those little guys swimming in there believe that it's a sea, then it certainly is a sea."`
`"Even though they're inside a finite tank."`
`"The sea is finite too.`
` No, even if it were infinite,`
` how much could we cover in our whole lives?`
` I'm sure that it would be so much smaller than a sea."`
`"...Certainly.`
` It's ironic, isn't it?`
` Even though the world is so vast, most of us live out our lives without ever leaving our own country."`
`"All it takes is the belief that it is a complete world...`
`for even the bottom of a narrow well to be a proper world, and a sea.`
` ...In the eyes of the frogs who live there."`
`Shannon, who spent her days as a servant on a small island ten kilometers in circumference called Rokkenjima,`
` said that with a smile.`
`After we finished walking through the whole aquarium, we had a slightly late afternoon lunch at a restaurant with a nice view.`
`Any boy's heart will jump about at the sight of a buffet.`
`I myself was like that in the past.`
`But with Shannon beside me, this buffet felt different.`
`{n}I couldn't shamefully make a huge pile of nothing but my favorite foods.`
`I was—how should I put it—worried about my appearance,`
` and chose a menu suited for a snob: toast, salad and coffee.`
`If I were by myself, I'd have made a pile of greasy stuff like yakisoba, mashed potatoes, gratins, and the like.`
`"Shannon, is that enough for you?`
` If it is, then I guess we men are animals with really bad fuel efficiency."`
`"...Umm,`
` I, I didn't mean to imply that......"`
`On Shannon's tray, there was only tea and salad.`
`{n}Maybe the very idea that she could "get away with at least one more dish" indicated I was thinking with my male stomach.`
`"What about you, George‐sama, will that be enough?`
` I think it's better for men to eat a little bit more.`
` ...You normally eat more than that for lunch, don't you?"`
`"Oops, right.`
` You already know how much I eat from when I have lunch on the island."`
`"Yes.`
` So, I was wondering whether your stomach isn't feeling well today..."`
`Shannon was showing concern that I wasn't feeling well.`
`{n}Apparently I had made her worry with my stupid attempt to impress her.`
`And in any case, it didn't seem like my stomach was going to let me keep this pretense up any longer.`
`"...Gah, ahaha...`
` I'll confess already.`
` I was just trying to look cool...`
` I just held back because I was with a girl..."`
`"I thought so.`
` Considering how much you eat during lunch at the family conferences, I thought that this wasn't nearly enough.`
` Please, don't be so reserved, and feel free to go and choose another dish."`
`"This isn't fair... All the embarrassment is on me.`
` What about you, then, Shannon?`
` Do you always manage your work for the Ushiromiya family while eating so little?"`
`"......Umm, uh,`
` ............au."`
`Shannon grew silent and blushed bright red.`
`Apparently, I wasn't the only one putting on a front.`
`{n}When I realized that, my embarrassment disappeared completely.`
`"That isn't enough for you either, is it?`
` Yes, normally, you eat more than this for lunch."`
`"A, a woman's stomach is made of magic, so this is enough...`
` au."`
`"This must mean that we were both trying to impress each other.`
` Let's not hold back anymore, shall we?"`
`I smiled to show that I wouldn't make fun of her anymore and stood up from the seat.`
`"We've come all the way to Okinawa—it would be a waste if we didn't eat some bitter melon.`
` I'll go get some fried bitter melon or something.`
` Come with me, Shannon.`
` C'mon, c'mon."`
`"Ah, yes...!"`
`To anyone watching us, we might have seemed like a pretty humorous—and above all embarrassing—couple.`
`But it's only after becoming a couple that you realize.`
`This banter means the world to us, and {i:is} our world.`
`{n}So, no matter how cold the looks we might have been getting from other people, we wouldn't even notice.`
`......Indeed, at this age, I finally understand the feelings of couples who want to endlessly flirt without any regard to their surroundings.`
`After I returned with a plate piled up with fried food, Shannon arrived with a lovely cake.`
`While laughing at our fake stoicism, we resumed our lunch.`
`"It's a shame that it's so cloudy, considering this restaurant has such a view of the sea."`
`Our window seats, which we were lucky to get, showed us seaside scenery so grandiose that it didn't even fit entirely within our field of vision.`
`However, because of the cloudy sky, it was a far cry from its normal beauty.`
`"Yes, it is.`
` If it had been clear, we would have seen quite the deep blue sea."`
`"Yes.`
` I imagine you're used to seeing the sea on Rokkenjima, but the sea here would surely have been an exceptional blue.`
` ...It's a real shame."`
`"Aah, but—no matter how blue it is, the sea I see during work might as well be gray.`
` But, today, I'm not working, so...I mean..."`
`Apparently, Shannon was doing her best to say an embarrassing line.`
` But I grade harshly.`
`"So close.`
` If only you'd said "when I look at it with you, even the grayest sea looks deep blue",`
` I'd have given you full marks and a reward."`
`"Uh,`
` ah,`
` I, I, I'm sorry......`
` nnnnnn..."`
`"Wanna hear what the reward would have been...?"`
`"Umm,`
` ......`
`uh,`
` if you wouldn't mind......"`
`"No.`
` I won't tell you.`
` Ahahahahahaha."`
`"Tha‐that's not fair..."`
`When I was in elementary school, I was always the kid that got bullied.`
`{n}When everyone teased me, I grew nervous and speechless, to the delight of the bullies.`
`Back then, I wondered why everyone teased me.`
`But now, teasing Shannon like this, I understand why.`
`{n}This is so much fun.`
`I can play with her emotions however I please,`
` ...and I can have them all to myself.`
`Right now, I can't think of any higher pleasure.`
`Which is exactly why I have to treat her lightly.`
`{n}I don't want her to get embarrassed and have a bad time.`
`{n}So I decided to end the topic there and then.`
`{n}It's not good to be too persistent.`
`"When you've finished your lunch, do you want to take a walk on the beach?`
` Perhaps the clouds will clear up and we'll be able to see a picturesque sea."`
`"That's a nice idea.`
` I'd like to do that."`
`"OK, that's what we'll do.`
` ...But that looks like a really delicious cake.`
` I wonder if I should get one like that too."`
`"You mustn't...`
` If you eat cake after already eating so much, you will get fat.`
` Hideyoshi‐sama's blood seems to run pretty thick in you, George‐sama, so if you don't take care, you will get chubby."`
`"So, Shannon, would you stop liking me if I got fat...?`
` I wouldn't stop liking you if you did."`
`"I, I didn't mean it that way...`
` I meant...if you don't take good care of your body, your health will...`
` au."`
`"Mother warns me all the time too.`
` Maybe I also need to take up Tai‐chi‐chuan or something to get some exercise."`
`"If you want to lose weight, it's best to start by reconsidering your eating habits, instead of doing intense exercise.`
` The exercise has to come on top of that, or you won't get any results, I hear."`
`"In other words, you're telling me not to eat cake, right?`
` Then, I guess I'll just have to gaze at you while you stuff your cheeks with that cake, Shannon."`
`"Uh,`
` er,`
` .........`
` ......Maybe one whole cake is too much,`
` ......but maybe just half of one would be alright.`
` Here, it's really delicious."`
`Shannon cut her own cake and tried to move half to my salad plate.`
`I had no doubt that she wanted to share the flavor of the delicious cake with me.`
`Even so, I deliberately and meanly pulled my plate away from her.`
`She blinked her eyes in surprise.`
` She couldn't seem to figure out if that was a refusal of the cake or not.`
`So I winked, opened my mouth, and said "aah".`
`"*giggle*.`
` This is what you wanted from the beginning, isn't it?`
` ......Gosh, you're such a pampered child, George‐sama."`
`"Okay,`
` say "aah"."`
`While still wearing an embarrassed, exasperated face, Shannon offered the cake to me with a fork.`
`Chomp.`
`It tasted like cheap chocolate cake you could find anywhere.`
` Still, it was exceptional.`
`Because eating cake in such an embarrassing way, as if we were the ultimate stereotypical lovey‐dovey couple, had been my dream for many years.`
`It made this cake's flavor heavenly...`
`If the Earth is destined to end someday, I wouldn't have had any regrets if it happened right then.`
`......It was such a moment of bliss.`
`After that, we gathered shells, ran from the waves, and enjoyed each other's company while walking along the beach.`
`In the end, the clouds never parted.`
` However, we both believed that our eyes were still reflecting a deep, blue sea.`
`".........Somehow, I'm so happy,`
` ...it makes me scared."`
`"You do say that from time to time.`
` What is it that you're afraid of?"`
`"...I'm...`
`......a servant of the Ushiromiya family.`
` For someone like me...to be here together with a member of the Ushiromiya family...`
` Um,`
` .........it just seems like too much for me."`
`"I'm also surprised.`
` I didn't just meet you today or yesterday, Shannon‐chan.`
` We've known each other for years now.`
` But we would only ever exchange greetings during family meetups, barely a few times per year."`
`"...I never imagined we'd become close enough that I could spend time with you like this.`
` It's the same for you too, right?"`
`"Uh,`
` ......I...`
`...umm..."`
`"Hm?"`
`"......I did...`
`...imagine.`
` No, umm, err!`
` Rather than imagination,`
` ......it was more like I was fantasizing......`
` You're always so considerate and gentlemanly, so I wondered, if we were in a relationship,`
` ......um, I just had fantasies of what it would be like......"`
`"Then, our relationship happened thanks to your believing heart.`
` Magic dwells in the power of dreaming.`
` So, I'm sure it was that magic that brought us together."`
`".........You're right.`
` ...I really think......that it truly was magic."`
`"But, you know, that's not quite right.`
` Every time we met, I saw you as more and more beautiful, and you grew to occupy a large space in my heart.`
` If the same thing happened to you,`
` then the fact that we are here today is simply an inevitable consequence, rather than something caused by magic or a miracle."`
`"...............No.`
` A miracle did happen,`
` George‐sama."`
`She stopped at the water's edge, and gazed beyond the sea.`
`" ......A miracle?"`
`"No, magic.`
` ...It happened."`
`I was bewildered by that slightly mysterious expression, which I sometimes heard her use.`
`"......Magic, you say?"`
`"Yes, magic.`
` .........You probably won't believe me even if I say it, so I won't.`
` But that magic definitely had the power to grant the miracle which brought you and me together."`
`"You mean, like a lucky chant to make your wish come true?"`
`"Perhaps.`
` Maybe it was something like that.`
` ...Except that it wasn't pretend—it really was real magic."`
`"...Hmm..."`
`Perhaps Shannon isn't alone in wanting to credit an encounter on a miracle, or on chance; it might be a universal thing all girls share.`
`For a man like me, an encounter with a girl is 70 percent effort to try to please her, and 20 percent raw courage.`
` And only 10 percent chance.`
`What she believes to be everything carries little relative weight within me.`
` ...Maybe that way of thinking is in itself calculating and typical of men.`
`But, were I to express that in words, any kind of magic would be broken.`
`I do think that to become this close has taken many fortuities, concessions, and great efforts from us both.`
`We have this private time together now only as the result of all those things put together,`
` and if she wants to call that "magic", that isn't strange in the slightest.`
`That's why I answered her the way I did:`
`"Yes.`
` ......If the same fate were repeated a hundred times, you and I might have gotten into a relationship like this only once."`
`"Our distant and formal connection could have continued right up to now, even as we both remained conscious of each other.`
` From the perspective of those otherworldly selves, we are undoubtedly in a miraculous relationship."`
`"It's not like that...`
` ......It really is magic."`
`"...Perhaps this is something that men will never believe, no matter how often you tell them.`
` Kanon‐kun didn't believe me at all, either."`
`"...I believe you.`
` ......Because I wouldn't want to break the magic by not believing in it."`
`"George‐sama..."`
`In a small voice, I apologized for making light of her magic.`
`Those words seemed to make Shannon a lot happier.`
`After all, if a pair of people believes in the magic of love, it becomes eternal.`
`"Oh, that's right.`
` I have a request, if you'd be willing to indulge me."`
`"...Yes?`
` What is it?"`
`"You know how you call me "George‐sama"?`
` It's not that I dislike it, but would you not call me that anymore?"`
`"Of course, you have to keep up your appearance with the Ushiromiya family, so I won't force you to do this during your everyday routine at Rokkenjima.`
` But, when we are alone, I'd rather you didn't call me that.`
` Yeah, let's create that rule."`
`"A, a rule?`
` Wh‐what would happen if I broke it...?"`
`"Good point.`
` Maybe rule violations do need to have some kind of penalty attached.`
` ...What should it be...`
` ......Wanna hear?"`
`"N‐no, I don't want to hear..."`
`"Ahahahahahaha.`
` I'll have to think about what it should be."`
`"Yes.`
` ......George...`
`san."`
`"...Yeah.`
` That sounds wonderful, doesn't it?`
` I'm so happy,`
` Shannon."`
`"I,`
` ......I...`
`...have the name Sayo...`
`......as well."`
`"Right.`
` Rules must be fair.`
` I'll abide by that too, and from now on, I'll call you Sayo.`
` Alright?`
` Sayo...?"`
`"Y‐yes."`
`I put my arm around her shoulder and held her close.`
`Her delicate body was pulled irresistibly towards me, and she leapt into my chest like a doll.`
` As I held her head in my arms, we looked at the horizon together.`
`"What a deep blue sea.`
` I'm so happy that we were able to see it together."`
`"......Me too.`
` It makes me very happy that I could look at such a deep blue sea with you."`
`As we gazed at the gray sea and a light rain began to sprinkle down,`
` we kept listening to each other's heartbeats...`
`The sound of waves soaked into my ears.`
` ...No, this was the sound of raging waves.`
` My body, bathed in painfully cold splashes, did not allow me to forget.`
`The memory of the day when my old fate was broken and smashed.`
`In the past, "tomorrow" had been literally like a mirror to me.`
`All I could see in it was the same me that existed "today".`
`{n}......My tomorrow would never be any different from my today.`
`That was my old fate.`
`...But at that moment, for the first time, I saw a different fate beyond the mirror.`
`The witch whispered.`
`She tempted me to take a bite out of the fruit of knowledge.`
`{n}She tormented me, saying that as long as I stayed in the paradise of God, I would remain furniture.`
`And so I learned of love, and decided to choose to become a person.`
`......Those days were like sweetly melting honey,`
` ......but then, I hadn't realized that they were the beginning of days filled with a new kind of suffering......`
`Taking a motorboat that I had just been told about, I made my way to this islet.`
`No, I couldn't possibly call it an islet.`
`{n}It'd really be more appropriate to call it a reef.`
`It had a torii and a small shrine for the local deity.`
`It was probably built to worship the guardian deity of Rokkenjima.`
`{n}......Even though I didn't know the exact meaning, I understood that it had a holy significance.`
`Despite being in a place like this, I took just one more look around to see if there was anyone observing me.`
`......The only things I could see were the stormy ocean, Niijima looming in the distance, and the waves breaking against Rokkenjima's steep cliffside.`
`I readied myself,`
` ......timidly approached the small shrine,`
` ...and took up the mirror that had been placed there.`
`It was an old‐looking mirror, dim and dirty.`
`{n}......If it were an ordinary mirror, that would probably give you a terribly bad impression of its value.`
`...However, since the mirror had been offered to this small shrine, that quality made me feel some kind of divinity from it.`
`......And I realized.`
`This was not merely a mirror.`
`{n}...Even if it was nothing more than an old‐looking mirror to a non‐believer like myself, in actuality, it was a mirror that had an important meaning.`
`......Is it really alright to break it after being captivated by honeyed words?`
`......No, this is no mirror.`
`{n}...It is the inescapable life I have lived until today—my fate.`
`Break it.`
`Break it, ......and seize a life from beyond the mirror.`
`{n}If I don't break it, my life will forever be a pair of facing mirrors.`
`{n}Nothing will ever change in the slightest...`
`The witch whispers.`
`She tempts me to take a bite out of the fruit of knowledge.`
`{n}Or maybe I have already had a taste of that fruit.`
`Because I ended up knowing those maddening emotions.`
`{n}Just as Adam and Eve felt compelled to pluck the fig leaf...`
`I can no longer...`
`...go without breaking this mirror.`
`I fought with conflict for many days.`
`{n}Inside my heart, the virtuous part of me and the part that sided with the witch repeatedly fought each other.`
`And now, here I am.`
`Did the part of me who is here win or lose?`
`There's only one thing I know.`
`{n}To obtain something, you must be ready to lose something.`
`The cowards who don't risk loss and never try to change anything will never be given the key to open the path to a new future.`
`The key is already in my hands.`
`It is—to break this.`
` To break it.`
`Is there any other effort I can make, as furniture imprisoned on Rokkenjima?`
`No.`
` There's nothing...but this.`
`Come, have courage.`
` I'll free myself from being mere furniture.`
`{n}And I'll accept my new sufferings, and become human.`
`{n}These are surely the small and large trials I must impose on myself.`
`Now,`
` ......break it.`
`Break the eternally unchangeable fate that imprisons me...into pieces......!`
`I raised it high,`
` .........thought back on all those days of conflict,`
` ......and, after a time far too brief to do them justice, I finished my reflections...`
`...`
`and threw it.`
`The thunder roared, ...crying out against me for my outrageous act.`
`{n}...It was truly the wrath of the angels, preparing to banish me from eternal paradise.`
`I looked down on the mirror tumbling at my feet, broken in two equal parts,`
` ...and, having made sure I had accomplished my task,`
` ......I looked up at the enraged sky, and screamed.`
`"...I,`
` ...............I kept...`
`......the promise...`
` ......Now,`
` .........it's your turn to keep your promise with me, right......?"`
`The thunder roared once more.`
`...I had already been banished from Paradise.`
`{n}So, I would have to struggle by myself in order to live.`
`The witch had said it.`
` That's the single element of the world.`
`To lose it—means to lose the world.`
`{n}...Like how a flask with a hole in the bottom can't be filled, no matter how much water you scoop into it...`
`"......I kept the promise.`
` .........Now, it's your turn to keep your promise.`
` ......Please, grant my wish!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐samaaaaaa!!"`
`My mind wandered.`
`Back to the days when I could barely imagine the happiness I have today.`
`I was a middle schooler at the time.`
`{n}An ordinary girl, who dreamed about love, as is normal at that age.`
`But I really should not have dreamed that dream.`
`...Because I am "furniture".`
`{n}Furniture is nothing more than a tool, and is not human.`
`For a person less than human such as myself, just receiving my education was more than sufficient happiness.`
`So even thinking about love was more than I deserved...`
`The Ushiromiya family conference was a customary event held every October,`
` but relatives would occasionally visit at other times as well.`
`{n}...Of course, they didn't come just to drink tea.`
`On this day, Eva's family had visited the head family on Rokkenjima.`
`The three people from Krauss's family and the three people from Eva's family had gathered in the parlor,`
` and were having a friendly chat as they updated everyone on their situations.`
`Genji had supposedly told Kinzo of Eva's family's arrival, but he hadn't come down yet.`
`...He was probably immersed in his own "research", and couldn't spare the time.`
`This often happened, so the others waited patiently for their fickle father to come down.`
`"Hoh.`
` That does sound promising.`
` Study a lot at your father's, and do your best to become able to help him soon."`
`"Thank you very much.`
` The mentors Father has introduced me to are providing me truly valuable study.`
` Everything I learn is something that can't be learned in school."`
`"It's not language or math you learn in school.`
` What you study is the attitude to have towards studying.`
` Once you form that basis, you can finally start a long period of study that'll last your entire life."`
`"People who don't get this will spend the rest of their lives with rocks for brains, totally unable to absorb knowledge.`
` They might get full marks in math and language, but they'll be useless for their company!"`
`"Mmhm, that is exactly right.`
` Hideyoshi‐san, your education policy is always truly excellent."`
`"You're not a full man yet, George!`
` Always keep that in mind, and embrace your studies."`
`"Oh, stop that, honey.`
` George is {i:always} doing his very best.`
` Aren't you?"`
`"Truly excellent.`
` I wish our Jessica would learn from him..."`
`"...Ughhh.`
` Are you {i:still} holding a grudge about my test scores?`
` I said I {i:am} studying for the exams, I'm doing it my own way.`
` You didn't have to bring it up here as well.`
` Cram it already."`
`When George was praised for his diligence, the conversation would nearly always turn to Jessica, who hated studying.`
`Jessica made an openly displeased face, as though she'd known it would come back to her.`
`"My, my...`
` In addition to studying, I think you need to learn to speak a little more ladylike, don't you?`
` It's quite shameful for a daughter who bears the Ushiromiya family crest."`
`"Oh, but this is charming in itself, don't you think?`
` Times change.`
` The times when we had to feign purity in order for a man to allow us to eat ended a long time ago."`
`"Yes, yes!`
` I knew you'd understand, Auntie Eva!`
` Eheheheh!"`
`"......Haah...`
` My headache is truly trying today."`
`"Are you alright?`
` Aunt Natsuhi, your face looks off‐color."`
`"Thank you, I am all right.`
` ......But time really has flown.`
` It feels like just yesterday when you would run around half‐naked by the beach and come back soaked."`
`"Wasn't Jessica‐chan the same?`
` And now she's a lady who fusses over how to put on makeup.`
` You really are particular about your eyebrows... You look really cute today."`
`"Thank you very much.`
` Nobody noticed, so my confidence was taking a beating."`
`A full smile rose to Jessica's face as the results of her own "studies" were finally noticed.`
`Eva smiled back just as widely.`
`{n}...Then, she turned that smile towards Natsuhi.`
`"Come on, Natsuhi nee‐san!`
` You must take notice of small changes in your own child.`
` Poor Jessica‐chan.`
` She must have wanted her mother to notice first, su~rely?"`
`"It's fine, it's fine.`
` She never notices anything like that."`
`"Jessica.`
` I do not think much of you calling your mother "she".`
` Apologize."`
`"......Later, I will speak to you at length about your language."`
`"Ugh...`
` If you've had enough of the annoying little kid, just say so next time.`
` I'm getting out of here.`
` This room is getting stuffy."`
`"Jessica...!"`
`Jessica was still at that unpredictable age with exams right around the corner.`
`{n}Recently, she had clashed often with her mother, who was enthusiastic about her education.`
`"Excuse me...`
` kya?!"`
`Jessica, making to leave the parlor in a bad mood, and Shannon, pushing a serving cart loaded with tea, bumped into each other.`
`"Ah, Shannon. Don't bother with my tea.`
` I'm just going to wander around the garden."`
`"...Mi‐Milady..."`
`"Shannon, the tea is getting cold.`
` Serve it quickly."`
`"My, my apologies..."`
`Shannon hadn't actually done anything wrong,`
` but Natsuhi, who felt like some shame to herself had been shown, lashed out at her emotionally.`
`...This was something that often happened in the Ushiromiya family.`
`{n}But it seemed that Shannon wasn't strong‐willed enough to accept it that way.`
`She shrunk back, and nervously prepared the black tea.`
`She had the unfortunate habit of making more mistakes when she felt intimidated.`
`Her pitiful appearance dispersed the peaceful atmosphere that had been there until just a moment ago.`
`That wasn't really Shannon's fault, but she thought she might be the source, and felt a pressure on her chest.`
`Her shaking fingers made the porcelain clatter, and you couldn't have called it graceful, not even as an empty compliment.`
`The more pitiful everyone thought that was, the greater the silence grew,`
` the more irritated Natsuhi looked, and the more Shannon cowered...`
`Shannon's thin neck felt like it was being choked and suffocated by the death god called tension.`
`Then, George spoke cheerfully, as if to blow away the stiff atmosphere.`
`"That's a nice smell.`
` What kind of tea is it?"`
`"Umm,`
` .........this is......"`
`"No, don't say it.`
` I'll guess.`
` It's a very distinctive smell, so I probably know it.`
` ......Is it...Earl Grey?"`
`"I, I think it probably is..."`
`"Ahahahaha.`
` It probably is Earl Grey.`
` When you get back to the kitchen, check the can."`
`"Hoh.`
` George‐kun, are you knowledgeable about black tea?"`
`"I'm currently in the service of a company president who knows a lot about black tea.`
` After enough time listening to his expositions, I picked up a little of it."`
`"Oh yeah, the president of Okonogi Foods.`
` That sort of in‐depth knowledge is his specialty!"`
`"The names of tea often refer to the place where it's made, right?`
` So is this something cultivated from a place called Earl Grey?"`
`"I have heard that long ago in England, there was an earl called Grey, and it was named after him."`
`"Incidentally, this distinctive smell doesn't come from tea leaves, but from a fruit called a bergamot, which is a relative of the mandarin orange."`
`"Is that so?`
` I never knew that.`
` Having that knowledge, the tea will taste even more delicious."`
`"Alcohol and cigarettes are the same.`
` With luxuries, you've gotta appreciate the romance.`
` Knowledge like this deepens the taste."`
`"It's the same with the advertising on medicine.`
` Natsuhi nee‐san, you should try reading the explanation on your favorite headache medicine someday.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"Hahahaha!`
` A fine idea.`
` Try it tonight."`
`"...Yes, I shall."`
`"Shannon‐chan, open that pot and have a look.`
` You should be able to find some dried bergamot mixed in with the tea leaves."`
`"Ah, ......yes.`
` It is in there.`
` Something like dried orange peel is mixed in."`
`"Yep.`
` That's probably bergamot.`
` The main ingredient in Earl Grey's scent.`
` The scent is vivid, so it gives the impression of having a sharp taste, but it's a docile taste that's easy to drink."`
`"It might be lovely to make it with milk—the scent should become more mild.`
` If there's anything left in the pot after you've poured for everyone, you really should make a milk tea out of it and try it out."`
`"Ah, ...yes...`
` Thank you very much..."`
`George gave her a small wink.`
`Shannon finally realized that George had been doing her a favor by calming down the atmosphere in the room.`
` And he had been doing it for her sake as she had lost her self‐confidence.`
`The Ushiromiya family did not pamper their servants.`
`{n}So if there was any awkwardness, they would be harshly punished.`
`So it didn't often happen that they were given a helping hand like this.`
`Thanks to George's concern, Shannon was somehow able to get ahold of herself and finish serving everything safely.`
`If she was calm when she worked, she could easily carry out her tasks elegantly and flawlessly.`
`By the time the black tea was laid out on the table and the elegant scent drifted around,`
` the room was completely back to how it had been, in a peaceful mood, as everyone praised George's knowledge.`
`Shannon wanted to thank him for saving her, but it didn't look like she would get the chance.`
`So she at least thanked him inside her heart, praying to God that George would hear it, and pushed the serving cart away.`
`"George nii‐san has always lent a helping hand in times like that.`
` By changing the topic or something."`
`Shannon and Jessica could be seen in the rose garden.`
`Jessica, having gotten into a fight with her mother, now felt unable to simply nonchalantly wander back into the parlor, and so found herself here, killing time.`
`"......When I think back on it, I feel that maybe this wasn't the first time he has helped me like that."`
`Whenever I made a careless mistake, and George‐sama was there,`
` he would always naturally smooth things over and make things harmonious, I think.`
`...Maybe it wasn't something as direct as picking up a fork that had been dropped.`
`But that was his way of caring.`
`{n}Even servants have pride.`
` They want to fix their own mistakes by themselves.`
`...Because if a guest helped them out with that, they would lose face.`
`"He's really good at reading between the lines in those kinds of situations.`
` Well, maybe that's George nii‐san's aesthetic take on things.`
` That guy's more of a show‐off than he looks.`
` Ahahahahaha."`
`"Tha‐that's not true...`
` ...I think he is a really wonderful person."`
`"Hmmmm...?!`
` ......Shannon, you haven't fallen in love with George nii‐san, have you?"`
`Shannon had refuted Jessica's words uncharacteristically forcefully, so Jessica caught on immediately.`
`"No, ...that's not it, I...think......"`
`"Come to think of it, I've never heard any of that kind of gossip about George nii‐san.`
` Wait...`
` Actually, didn't I hear him say that family‐oriented girls were his type?`
` Nice, that fits you perfectly, Shannon!"`
`"It, it, it does...?!`
` I don't—`
`I am not, umm,`
` ...qualified...for that..."`
`"You sure are qualified!`
` You've known each other for years, you're almost childhood friends.`
` They say that when you have a natural relationship where you don't think of each other as boy and girl, it's plain sailing once you do!`
` No doubt!"`
`Jessica loved teen magazines with these kinds of stories, and she was always on the phone talking excitedly with her friends about that kind of thing.`
`So she had a keen intuition for this kind of romantic topic.`
`So, this wasn't the first time a topic like this had been brought to Shannon.`
`But it was certainly the first time she had noticed George as a member of the opposite sex.`
`She was furniture, and George was an honored guest connected to the Ushiromiya family.`
`{n}......She had thought it impermissible to even imagine any deeper relationship.`
`So she hadn't thought about it.`
`Jessica was taking immense pleasure in poking fun at all this, since it didn't affect her.`
`{n}Shannon was doing her best to make sure that her blushing cheeks weren't discovered.`
`So if George showed up at a time like that, there would be no way that she would be able to keep her cool.`
`They saw George come out from the entrance hall of the mansion.`
`{n}It looked like he had seen them as well.`
`{n}He headed over, waving his hand.`
`Shannon had to frantically try to regain her ordinary composure before George reached them...`
`"Grandfather finally came down.`
` Now they're having an adult discussion, so they chased me out."`
`"Hahaha, escaping then was the right choice.`
` I'd sooner kiss a god of pestilence than go look Grandfather in the face."`
`"You shouldn't speak that way.`
` ...However, I think Grandfather may think of us as such pestilent creatures.`
` After all, we came over here specifically to ask him for money for business."`
`That's right—this wasn't the customary annual October family conference.`
`Eva's family had visited to apply for a business loan from the main family.`
`Kinzo had vast resources, and he lent those out to his children.`
`Of course, this was not money to lend because they had gotten themselves into financial trouble.`
`{n}...How would they expand their business, using the vast amount of money that they borrowed?`
`How much interest would be attached, and how soon could it be repaid?`
`This wasn't a loan for the have‐nots.`
`{n}It was a loan for those who were on the offense.`
`Kinzo judged strictly whether it was worth lending out his fortune, and afterwards, he strictly oversaw its use.`
`So there was occasionally this spectacle where relatives visited Rokkenjima and explained their business to Kinzo.`
`To the parents, it may well have been a meeting concerning the movement of large sums of money, forcing immense stress upon them.`
`But to Jessica, who lived on this isolated island called Rokkenjima, it was a precious opportunity to meet up with her cousins.`
`So even her bad mood from getting into that fight with her mother...`
`was immediately cured by this chat with the infrequent visitor George.`
`"My family's a total bunch of tightwads.`
` They've probably got money to spare, why not be generous with it.`
` I bet my Dad and Grandfather are both just being really tight."`
`"It's natural to be prudent when lending money.`
` Of course, my father has come with a plan by which he can expand his business with what he borrows, and which he can definitely repay.`
` Everything else will be up to the presentation."`
`"......Really, I would have liked to watch alongside and learn.`
` But Mother chased me out.`
` I'm a little let down."`
`"......It seems that the Master still scolds Krauss‐sama and Eva‐sama in just the same way he did when they were kids.`
` I'm sure she didn't want to show that to you, her son."`
`As Shannon hung her head, she thought back on those scenes she had grown used to seeing while working in the mansion.`
`Even Krauss, who acted haughtily towards his siblings, was still treated like a child by Kinzo.`
`...Shannon herself had often seen Kinzo slapping Krauss, or making him sit in {c:86EF9C:{i:seiza}}‐style.`
`......It was probably deeply humiliating to have that forced upon him at his age.`
`In the Ushiromiya family, taking care not to be present when this happened was one of the great tasks of the servants.`
`...Of course, that did mean that Shannon had been making mistakes by being witness to it.`
`"Probably.`
` ...Realizing that and going away may be my duty as her child.`
` ......Welllll!`
` All that aside, the flowers in this garden are truly splendid this year, aren't they?"`
`George stretched as he said that.`
`...And truly effortlessly, he changed the subject away from something that had become a little gloomy.`
`This time, Shannon noticed it too.`
`......This person, George, was highly sensitive to the mood of a group, and was always caring enough to change the subject to something harmonious.`
`It had been so smooth that Shannon hadn't noticed it until today.`
`Today, Shannon had to really admire that behavior of George's.`
`Almost all of the boys Shannon knew of her own age were her classmates during her education.`
`But they were all immature, ......and none of them had had the composure that George did.`
`Even though he had been just another guest until moments ago,`
` ...now, she couldn't describe him with just that.`
`But that was idle thinking, irrelevant to her work as a servant.`
`{n}Shannon tried to chase it away with a small shake of her head.`
`"Hm?`
` What's up?"`
`"Ah, no, it's nothing...!"`
`"Umm, shall I prepare some tea?`
` Uhh, ......I will prepare some more of that Earl Grey for you."`
`"Ahaha, so you remembered the name of that black tea.`
` I'm happy."`
`"Um, .........umm........."`
`"Hm?"`
`"...Umm, ......thank you for your concern back then..."`
`Shannon was finally able to put her thanks into words.`
`If you wrote them out on paper, they wouldn't seem like much,`
` ...but Shannon had needed just a little courage to say them out loud.`
`But George played dumb.`
`"What's this?`
` I don't remember doing anything I should be thanked for?`
` Heheh."`
`It seemed he was being a gentleman in his own way, saying that he hadn't helped her because he wanted to be thanked.`
`It seemed that George's response had been more or less predictable to Jessica.`
` She burst out laughing uncontrollably.`
`"Seeee?`
` This is it, isn't he a show‐off?"`
`"N‐no...`
` I don't think that's......"`
`Jessica made fun of Shannon as she remained silent, red‐faced.`
`{n}George didn't know the details, but he naturally joined in, laughing the same way.`
`The three of them lazily walked around the garden, talking about what was new.`
`George, as the oldest cousin, talked about his life experiences.`
`{n}Jessica talked about recent life on Rokkenjima.`
`{n}And Shannon talked about her recent work.`
`These silly little topics went round and round in circles.`
`Even when the others' stories had been fascinating,`
` Shannon had never felt particularly connected to their contents.`
`She was nothing more than a servant, and she had no intention of delving into her masters' lives.`
`She simply wanted them to enjoy their time speaking with her,`
` and was only pretending to listen intently, and nodding at the right moments.`
`But for some reason, she found talking with George deeply interesting today.`
`Even for things that she would normally ignore, she felt like she could feel a kindness hidden beneath the words.`
`For some reason, she wanted to know more things about George, no matter how trivial.`
`So...she stared fixedly at him.`
`She thought that as far as looks went, this person Ushiromiya George, ......was probably...`
`about average, and he didn't really stick out.`
`But he was diligent, serious, ...and deeply thoughtful in a way that allowed him to understand people's hearts and care for them.`
`But she had never been aware of these things until now.`
`{n}She might not have met him many times, but she had known his face for many years.`
`Even so, she had not noticed once until now.`
`{n}...So Shannon felt ashamed of this, and her cheeks went red.`
`Maybe George thought that Shannon was appreciating him talking about himself, because he continued to relate his personal stories.`
`...But Jessica didn't miss that slight change in Shannon.`
`So she turned the discussion around to the topic Shannon wanted to hear about most.`
`"......Oh yeah, come to think of it!`
` George nii‐san, did you finally get a girlfriend yet or what?"`
`"Wha‐what is this, out of the blue..."`
`Normally, just George's reaction would have been answer enough.`
`But for some reason, as she was now, Shannon found herself unable to understand it unless he said it clearly.`
`"Um, ...umm...`
` George‐sama is very nice,`
` ......so I'm sure...`
`umm......he must be very popular with the girls......"`
`"No, err, ...hahahahahahahahahaha."`
`"Quit it Shannon~.`
` That's pretty meeeean, cornering him like that...`
` *cackle*!"`
`"I, I wasn't trying to be mean........."`
`"Thank you for your happy wrong impression.`
` It's a shame, but I still don't have a relationship with any special girl.`
` As you can see, my looks are below average.`
` And I can't speak wittily in a way that can entertain a girl."`
`"I, I don't think that's true.`
` ......And...I think that a man's charm is decided by things you can't measure on the outside.`
` Tha‐that's why, umm,`
` ......I think that you might be a, um, ...very charming man, George‐sama..."`
`Shannon was uncharacteristically verbose.`
`{n}Compared to her normal self, she was being very wordy indeed.`
`George looked fairly pleased about hearing his own charm described, but he was just a little surprised at this high praise.`
`Jessica, sure now that her own imagination was right on, acted as though she could barely hold back her laughter.`
`"Thank you, Shannon‐chan.`
` I hope I soon run into a girl gracious enough to find me attractive."`
`"Yes, I'm sure you will.`
` ......I'm sure there's a girl not—`
`I mean, a, a, a lot of girls who will recognize your real charm."`
`She probably wanted to say "there's a girl not very far away".`
`...She avoided saying that much, drawing a final line as a servant.`
`"Re‐......really.`
` ...I guess I'm kind of...embarrassed..."`
`Maybe he had never been praised this much by a girl.`
`{n}George's face turned just as bright red as Shannon's.`
`As she watched the two of them, Jessica giggled sadistically.`
`"Well, I'm sure you'll eventually find a wonderful partner, George nii‐san.`
` But I don't think you'll be able to escort your partner as you are now, riiiight?`
` Your Braininess may be a diligent worker, but it looks like you're totally clueless when it comes to {i:that} aspect of your studies."`
`"...E‐excuse me for being ignorant.`
` I'll start studying that bit by bit."`
`"How would you do that by yourself?`
` Are you gonna watch movies about love?`
` Learn from Uncle Hideyoshi?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Tch...`
` You're milking it for all it's worth, aren't you?`
` Men aren't a match for girls in this kind of conversation."`
`Normally, when George and Jessica got together, their parents would say "George is diligent and admirable", and "Jessica is lazy and rude".`
`So it was probably irresistible fun for Jessica when their roles were finally reversed.`
`George also realized that, so this time, he was content with being the one who was teased.`
`"Then, George nii‐san, as long as you're okay with it, why not practice a bit with Shannon?`
` Keep Shannon entertained all day long on a date!`
` What do you think?!"`
`"Wh‐wha‐what are you...!`
` Mi‐Milady...!"`
`When she heard Jessica's audacious plan, Shannon's face turned bright red, and a donut of smoke rose from it with a "poof".`
`"Tha‐that's a very attractive plan, but...I'd feel bad for Shannon‐chan.`
` I wouldn't just be wasting her precious day off,`
` I'd also be butting in on the ideal moment when she'd be able to be alone with someone she really has feelings for.`
` I couldn't do something so boorish."`
`"I, I, ...I also, umm......`
`......don't have a person I have feelings for or anything, so, umm,`
` ...caring for me like that is—yes, it's, it's unnecessary...!"`
`Shannon's blood had all rushed to her head, and it looked like even she didn't know what she was babbling about.`
`Jessica, who knew how Shannon normally was, seemed to find that really comical.`
`She couldn't hide her cackling laugh anymore.`
`"...I‐is that true...?`
` I can't believe that a cute girl like you would be single, Shannon‐chan..."`
`"I, I, I,`
` ...I'm a servant, so, umm,`
` ......I don't have any opportunities to meet boys, and, umm..."`
`"Which means that, in the future, if Shannon's gonna have any chance of getting herself a wonderful guy,`
` she needs practice with relationships, right?`
` So you each want the same thing.`
` Alright, that'll work nice, *cackle*!"`
`Jessica irresponsibly cheered the two of them on.`
`{n}Now, George was also hanging his head, red‐faced.`
`"George, I've been calling for you.`
` Couldn't you hear me?"`
`Since Eva appeared in what was already an embarrassing situation, both of them became even more flustered.`
` Jessica was in stitches.`
`"Ah, M‐M‐Mother...!`
` Sorry, our conversation got complicated.`
` I didn't notice...!"`
`"Oh, Eva‐sama... My deepest apologies..."`
`"It sounds like you young kids were getting really excited.`
` You're all about that age.`
` I remember well what that's like—you must have no end of things like that to talk about.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"Oh, come on, Auntie Eva, you're still in your priiime!`
` Please tell us how you and Uncle Hideyoshi met!"`
`"Oh my, there's no way I could tell you that.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*.`
` You're all so young.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"S‐so, what is it, Mother?`
` You called because you wanted something, right?"`
`"Your father and the rest have finished talking.`
` We're going to talk to Grandfather about you, so come on."`
`"About me?`
` What could that be?"`
`"The same topic you all were just having.`
` Remember, that topic?"`
`"Oh, ...oh, that topic.`
` That isn't really something we need to talk to Grandfather about, is it...?"`
`"What are you talking about?`
` Wait, George nii‐san, you aren't getting married to someone?!"`
`"Con‐...congratulations...!"`
`"No, no...!`
` Didn't I just say I don't have a special woman?"`
`"That isn't something to brag about, is it?`
` ...Seriously."`
`Eva smiled bitterly, looking a little exasperated.`
`"...Ah, ...I got it!`
` George nii‐san, it's one of those, right? A marriage meeting!"`
`"A marriage meeting...?"`
`"......nn, ......well, yeah.`
` ......Hahahaha..."`
`As a man, George undoubtedly wanted to find a partner by himself and carry her off himself.`
`So it seemed that he found the idea of meeting his partner for the first time in a marriage meeting arranged by his parents to be a little pathetic.`
`"Shouldn't marriage meetings be done at a more mature age...?!`
` I still don't feel like I've become an adult..."`
`"We don't intend on rushing you into an immediate engagement or marriage—of course not.`
` It isn't a problem if you deepen your friendship first, and then have her moved to our family register later when you settle down as you age."`
`From the forceful impression Eva was giving, and George's evasiveness, it seemed you could catch a glimpse of how this marriage meeting linked into everything.`
`Who this other person was remained unclear, but it was surely someone profitable to Eva's family in a business sense.`
`It felt almost like a political strategy; they wanted to create a connection between the two families, if not by changing registers, then at least by having them get engaged.`
`"Marriage isn't something you do after you start liking someone.`
` It's something you get used to after you do it.`
` If you marry just based on emotions, you'll definitely regret it.`
` There's definitely nothing wrong with choosing a person with a secure background as your partner in life, and then building up emotions of love."`
`"Auntie Eva, that's so rude to Uncle Hideyoshiii...`
` *cackle*!"`
`"I love him, you know.`
` I want to always be with him, and to live my life by his side."`
`"......Eva‐sama, that's wonderful.`
` Truly splendid..."`
`"Thank you.`
` But we built up those feelings while we were husband and wife, you see?`
` And I believe that in the future, we will be much, much closer than we are now.`
` I think that's the best way for a husband and wife to be."`
`"Although I don't think that makes it alright to marry someone you don't even like."`
`"And {i:that} doesn't make it alright to marry whoever you want just so long as you like them.`
` A wedding only lasts a moment.`
` But your life as a married couple after that is very, very long."`
`"So you should search with prudence, and not leave it up to momentary emotions.`
` And don't you think that your mother and the rest of us would be better at that than a person inexperienced in life like yourself?"`
`"......Tha‐that may be true, but..."`
`"You are my pride and joy—my only son.`
` You have grown into a fine man who could match up to anyone.`
` ...And with Battler‐kun leaving the register, you are the only grandson to carry Father's blood.`
` ......We must prudently choose a fitting partner for you."`
`As everyone related to the Ushiromiya family knew, Eva adored George so much that he was the apple of her eye.`
`But that didn't mean she had pampered him.`
`{n}She had raised him strictly, and he had grown into a charming man who wouldn't betray her expectations.`
` ...That's how he was the apple of her eye.`
`"We definitely aren't deciding your partner based on what we personally stand to gain from it.`
` ......I will introduce you to a truly wonderful woman who's right for you.`
` Right now, you may still have some immature youth inside of you that's turning you away from this."`
`"......But at least listen to what your mother says on this point.`
` Have I ever failed to think of what's best for you?"`
`".....................No, ......you haven't..."`
`"That's all you need to think of for now.`
` Come on now, let's go.`
` We're keeping Father waiting.`
` Hurry to the mansion."`
`"Well, sorry, you two.`
` See you later."`
`George bowed to the two of them, ...and after bowing once more to Shannon, he dashed off to the mansion.`
`"I'll be going as well, then.`
` Sorry for cutting your fun conversation short, Jessica‐chan, Shannon‐chan."`
`"Ah, no no.`
` Please don't worry about it.`
` Come on, Shannon.`
` Let's go."`
`"Ye‐yes...!"`
`"It's alright.`
` I'm sure you'll meet someone wonderful soon too, Jessica‐chan.`
` A wonderful person suitable for you."`
`"So if he's at the same level as me, hahaha, you mean a guy with bad grades?`
` Well that kinda frickin' sucks, hahaha!"`
`"And of course, you too, Shannon‐chan.`
` I'm sure that a wonderful man suitable for you will appear."`
`"Ye‐yes!!`
` Thank you very much..."`
`As Eva giggled and smiled, she approached Shannon's ear with a hand over her mouth, as though she was trying to tell her a secret.`
`".........Huh?"`
`"I'm sure you'll find a perfect match for a lowly servant like yourself.`
` ......Have you forgotten to be grateful for your schooling?`
` Know your place."`
`".........Th‐...that's not what I... ...I didn't..."`
`"George is the eldest grandson carrying Father's blood.`
` He's a person who may bear the burden of the Ushiromiya family someday in the future."`
`"To answer that expectation, he has studied tirelessly, entered a wonderful college, and is getting wonderful grades.`
` Do you reeeally think you're in his league, you incompetent, unqualified, uncultured seeerrrrvant?"`
`Those malicious words all poured into Shannon's ear without spilling a drop...`
`......To Shannon, it was like cold water was being poured in there.`
`".....................I, I...`
`...didn't mean..."`
`This was all whispered in secret.`
`{n}And with the same smile as before.`
`...Jessica, who could only see Eva's expression, didn't think it was anything other than Eva telling Shannon some embarrassing story about love.`
`When their secret conversation ended, Eva patted Shannon's shoulders, as though to underscore her message.`
`"Don't worry!`
` I'm sure that you'll find a partner just "perfect" for you.`
` Right?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*.`
` ...Alright, Jessica‐chan.`
` See you later."`
`"Yeah, see you later!`
` And then, please tell me some stories about you and Uncle Hideyoshi~~!!"`
`"No waaay.`
` Ahahahahahahahahaha...!"`
`Eva laughed dryly and headed back to the entrance hall.`
`Behind Jessica, who was cheerfully waving her hand,`
` ...Shannon reflected very, very deeply on those words of Eva's, about knowing her place...`
`...I felt deep remorse for my brief moment of conceit.`
`I had forgotten.`
` I am furniture.`
`Furniture isn't human.`
`So I am a being who must feel gratitude for even being treated like a human,`
` and I am not permitted to wish for anything more.`
`Even if people develop affection for furniture that they're used to using,`
` that is an emotion on the human's side, and the furniture has no right to hope for that.`
`......They should just serve with simple honesty every day.`
`But that feeling I felt when talking with George‐sama and Jessica‐sama...is a forbidden drug for me.`
`In other words, it may have been an emotion I must not know.`
`"......Shannon.`
` You have been too distracted for a while now.`
` Are you feeling ill?"`
`"N‐no.`
` My apologies..."`
`Natsuhi's words "too distracted" were right on the mark.`
`...Even Shannon couldn't believe that she hadn't noticed Natsuhi until she had been called.`
`This was supposed to be the time when she had to concentrate on the cleaning.`
`But she had just kept sighing and hadn't accomplished anything...`
`"Even if there aren't any guests, you must always be alert.`
` Acting like this is shameful as a servant working for the Ushiromiya family."`
`"...Yes.`
` I will take care from now on..."`
`"The head and my husband will return very soon.`
` Have you finished cleaning the study?`
` Have you finished cleaning the staircase?"`
`"My, my apologies...`
` Not yet..."`
`"Yes, I know.`
` So I had Lunon do it.`
` While you were plodding around cleaning the hallway, she finished cleaning the study and the staircase."`
`"......That's because, umm,`
` ......I wanted to clean thoroughly, so it took some time......"`
`Shannon was simple and honest, so she would always carry out her tasks seriously and properly, without any omissions.`
`So she was always slow with her work.`
`In contrast, Lunon skillfully cut corners wherever they should be cut.`
`{n}So she could complete her jobs with a result that looked similar to an outsider, but in a much shorter time.`
` In other words, she was shrewd.`
`Compared to her, we should say that Shannon, who had just talked back to Natsuhi when she was already in a bad mood, was not shrewd in the slightest...`
`Of course, there was nothing that Natsuhi couldn't stand more than a servant talking back.`
`{n}Her forehead creased, and she spoke sternly.`
`And yet, her speech was slow and admonishing, which was terrifying beyond measure, and finally made Shannon realize she had said the wrong thing...`
`"In that case, you shall clean as thoroughly as you desire.`
` Shannon, I order you to clean the reception hall right now.`
` It is an important hall, where several pictures treasured by the head are displayed, and where honored guests of the Ushiromiya family are invited."`
`"Clean it thoroughly, so that not a speck of dust remains, and so that even you are satisfied.`
` Of course, you will finish today.`
` Until you finish and report to me, you will not be permitted any food or rest.`
` Understood?"`
`"Ye‐.........yes, Madam."`
`"That is good.`
` Servants should endeavor to use only those words.`
` The next time you talk back, I will give you an even more severe punishment, so keep that in mind.`
` Engrave these words in your heart."`
`"Yes, ...Madam.`
` ...Thank you for your guidance."`
`"You are welcome."`
`Natsuhi headed off down the corridor, making a gesture as if her headache was troubling her...`
`Once Shannon couldn't see her anymore, she hung her head and sighed.`
`......This happened because I let my thoughts take me.`
`I might be bad at everything I do, but I should at least be able to carry out the cleaning as well as an average person can, right?`
` I can't even do that properly—it's so pathetic it makes me cry.`
`And there's something even more pathetic.`
`Not only was I unable to perform a single bit of cleaning well,`
`{n}but just now, when Natsuhi was scolding me...`
`.........I was envisioning him appearing and rescuing me.`
`If only George‐sama had been here,`
`{n}perhaps he would have casually stepped in and saved me.`
`I'm sure he would show up cheerfully, intentionally acting like he doesn't know what's going on, nimbly change the subject, and make me forget I was ever reprimanded by Natsuhi...`
`I kept envisioning him...`
`suddenly appearing from the other side of the door...`
`or the other end of the hallway.`
`I envisioned the kind of person that would be an appropriate partner for him in a marriage meeting.`
`And I envisioned how unfitting I am for him.`
`Eva had told me that clearly.`
`{n}It had repeated endlessly through my dreams...`
`".........You're still as clumsy as always, Nee‐san.`
` Madam has been in a bad mood since this morning.`
` You spoke out of turn when you should have hung your head in silence."`
`"......Kanon‐kun..."`
`Kanon was suddenly there.`
`{n}......His footsteps were always quieter than a cat's, and he left no trace of his presence.`
`She probably wouldn't have noticed him no matter how long he stood there...`
`The expression on Kanon's face was...hatred.`
`{n}That expression he was making, he surely made for Shannon, who didn't know how to do so herself...`
`"Madam and Lunon can go to hell.`
` She knows where Madam checks, and only cleans those areas.`
` Her cleaning just now was like that.`
` I know because I was watching."`
`".........She wasn't cleaning in any real sense of the word.`
` ...She's just the worst kind of parasite, leeching off of your thorough work."`
`"You mustn't use such dirty words...`
` Dirty words pollute your clean soul, Kanon‐kun.`
` So don't use those words in front of me at least.`
` ......Alright?"`
`"............Hmph."`
`Kanon faced away, acting sulky.`
`It was a dishonest reaction, very like Kanon‐kun, ...but I was a little happy.`
`He got angry in my place.`
`"......Cleaning the reception hall will be tough.`
` I'll help."`
`"Thank you.`
` But I was the one Madam ordered, so don't worry.`
` ......Don't you also have your own work, Kanon‐kun?"`
`"...............It's a filthy job.`
` My soul was corrupted long ago."`
`Kanon then hung his head, and bit his lower lip...`
`"Just saying that you'll help is enough for me.`
` ...If you don't go back to your own job, even you will receive punishment.`
` ...And that would make me sad."`
`Shannon knew Kanon's character well.`
`{n}...Sometimes, he didn't reflect on himself.`
`If I don't refuse forcefully, he will help me even if it means neglecting his own job...`
`Kanon was a little sad that his favor had been rejected,`
` but he realized that in the end, going too far would also cause her pain, and he gave a single, small sigh.`
`"............`
` ...Fine.`
` ......Do your best, Nee‐san."`
`"Yes.`
` .........Besides, I am also partly to blame."`
`"You aren't at fault at all, Nee‐san...!"`
`"...No.`
` I am.`
` ......So go now."`
`Kanon‐kun's face showed that he still hadn't completely accepted it, but he stopped being persistent, and disappeared.`
`......Even though Kanon‐kun had given me words of comfort when I was down...`
`...Even so, I was still dejected because it hadn't been "him".`
`{n}That was, simply, a sin.`
`Far beyond any dream the likes of me could be permitted to see—know your place.`
`...Shannon, who had neglected breakfast, was already starting to feel her thoughts attenuate.`
`......But if she didn't finish cleaning the reception hall, she couldn't receive Natsuhi's permission to eat.`
`That cruel Natsuhi had surely told the kitchen of that.`
`...I have to respectfully receive Madam's punishment.`
`That's right.`
` My position in the world is furniture, ...and I had been intoxicated by a dream that is beyond me...`
`I finished cleaning the hallway and went to the reception hall.`
`Maybe hunger makes a nose more sensitive.`
`The kitchen was far away, but somehow I could smell the delicious aroma wafting from there, stimulating my empty stomach all the more.`
`...Until I finished up here, I could not get any soup.`
` I just had to prepare myself.`
`Several portraits were hung in the reception hall.`
`One of those portraits...was thought amongst the servants to hold a special meaning.`
`......It was the portrait of the witch.`
`{n}That wasn't its true name, but everyone in the mansion called it that.`
`The name of the woman with elegant blonde hair, drawn as the subject of that portrait, was {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`...It was whispered that she might be the former mistress of the family head, Kinzo.`
`{n}......And also that she was the great witch who had given Kinzo his legendary gold.`
`The witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, master of the night on Rokkenjima.`
`{n}She was gracious to those who respected her, but she would always curse those who made light of her.`
`It was in Shannon's character not to neglect rules and beliefs such as those.`
`...So she thought of the portrait of her other master as that person herself, and always treated it carefully, treasuring it.`
`...And it had become part of her daily routine to talk, inside her own head, to the witch who only existed inside the portrait.`
`......She was furniture.`
` Furniture doesn't complain.`
` Cannot complain.`
`{n}So she had no right to speak her mind about her difficult days.`
`{n}No right to open her mouth and say those words.`
`So, ......she at least spoke her mind inside her heart.`
`{n}Those words she couldn't say aloud, she spoke inside her heart, ...and protested to the formless witch.`
`Of course, the witch didn't answer.`
`{n}She never consoled, and she never laughed it off.`
`{n}......Shannon could only interpret that silence as she liked, as though the witch was at least listening attentively.`
`...{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
`......Please listen to me, worthless as I am.`
`As Shannon wiped the dust from the witch's portrait, she spoke inside her heart.`
`.........Just as Eva‐sama says, I truly am incompetent and uncultured furniture.`
`......I am not a person.`
`...So maybe I have no right to love...`
`......But in that case, why was I given a heart which can know love?`
`...Shannon paused there, and held back her tears for a time.`
`The sound of the rain which had started falling, along with the chill air in the reception hall, made her feel as though her shabbiness had increased another level.`
`"Real furniture...doesn't have a silly thing like a heart.`
` So they don't have to love people, right?`
` So they don't feel pain.`
` ......If I'm just another piece of furniture, ......why do I have a heart?"`
`".........If it's going to be this hard and this painful, ............I wish I'd never been given this stupid heart............!"`
`......I see.`
` To have given a heart to furniture.`
`Amusing games that one plays sometimes...`
`*cackle*cackle*...!`
`"e........................"`
`The witch who never answered or laughed...`
`...answered,`
` and laughed.`
`My imagination?`
` Hearing things?`
` No.`
`...After all, the next words became a "voice", and I could hear them, not with my heart, but with my ears...`
`"Humans have been continually searching for the elements that make up the world since before the Christian Era.`
` It is said that the ancient Greeks tried explaining the world with the four elements of air, fire, water, and earth."`
`"And after that, over several millennia, humans added several elements to those four,`
` trying to explain the world with a host of interpretations—the five elements, the six elements, the seven elements, the eight elements, the twelve elements—`
`but they could never explain the one true "single element"."`
`".........However, a single man appeared by the guidance of a star, and finally explained the single element that makes up the world.`
` Do you know what it is......?"`
`"...............e...`
`.........a...`
`.........wh‐`
`............wh‐who........."`
`Shannon fearfully turned around...`
`Right there, ......she "existed".`
`Not as an illusion—in reality.`
` The contrast made by the lightning made it clear that this was not just a daydream.`
`"......It is "love".`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The witch of the portrait elegantly held a golden pipe to her mouth, and giggled.`
`...She laughed at the ignorance which caused mankind's thoughts to stray far from the most simple answer.`
`"That man explained everything in the world with love.`
` That is the single element.`
` With the smallest possible number, that man fully explained how the world was constructed."`
`"......How simple and clear, how splendid, exhilarating, pleasant and thrilling.`
` ...The year that man was born eventually came to be known as Anno Domini.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*!"`
`Shannon lost any words to speak.`
` She thought that when first meeting an unknown guest, her first words should ask that person's name.`
`But without saying anything, ...Shannon knew this person's name, so she refrained.`
`No, ......surely, as a person of this island, asking this person for her name would be the greatest disrespect.`
`Because...she was the other master of this island in addition to Kinzo.`
`"B‐.........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama..............."`
`"Indeed.`
` I am {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` .........The face people make when they first see me hasn't changed after one thousand years.`
` ...*cackle*."`
`The witch giggled at how Shannon's reaction didn't betray her expectations.`
`Shannon realized that she had met with a being that mustn't be met with, and she took a step backwards.`
`......That's where the wall and the portrait were, so even as she gazed at the witch, she supported the witch's portrait on her back.`
`"Your worries are due to love.`
` ......Which is the single element of the world.`
` In other words, everything of this world.`
` ......When that is not whole, it means the world is not whole.`
` It is like continually scooping water into a flask with a hole in it."`
`"......Even if you scoop and scoop, it is never filled—an eternal desert of the heart.`
` The original sin that humans are founded upon and everything is made of."`
`"Understand?`
` What Adam and Eve learned when they put the fruit of knowledge to their lips was love.`
` ...Because of that, humans were chased out of Paradise and became "human".`
` Which means that what makes one human is knowing love, and suffering."`
`"......Girl of kind heart.`
` You should be proud.`
` Now that you have known it, you are no longer furniture.`
` Now, you are "human".`
` I recognize that upon my name."`
`".....................umm, .........u......"`
`"Hmph.`
` Is it hard for an inferior being to understand?`
` ...Oh, well.`
` *cackle*cackle*...`
` Forgive me.`
` It has been a long time since I have spoken with a human.`
` I shall apologize for my talkativeness."`
`Without expecting a reply from Shannon, {f:5:Beatrice} laughed pleasantly for a while.`
`"I am not sure that this is sufficient for an apology,`
` ......but I can use my power to grant that desire of yours, if you'd like?"`
`"...Huh...?"`
`The meaning of those words surprised Shannon even more than the witch's sudden appearance.`
`"I am offering to bring you and the one you love together.`
` ......Normally, I would demand something of equal value in return."`
`"...*cackle*, I am in a good mood.`
` And you have never failed to pay your respects to me in the past.`
` That is something worth rewarding."`
`"............Do, ............do you really mean it......?"`
`Normally, Shannon would have been shocked by this guest who lacked realism, and wouldn't have been able to speak.`
`......However, as though she had already been caught in the witch's trap,`
` ...Shannon responded to the witch.`
`"With my magic, it is no trouble at all to arrange for a pair of people with feelings for each other to be joined."`
`You do mean it, don't you...`
` ...Those words almost escaped Shannon's lips, but she held herself back, with her final reserves of reason.`
`A witch is a witch.`
` A sinister being.`
`The witch {f:5:Beatrice} is clearly trying to slip in through the cracks in my heart and take me prisoner......`
`That sort of temptation, which so many fairy tale picture books had warned me about when I was young, was right in front of me now.`
`"Fear too is a form of respect.`
` It may be pleasant for me, but we will make no progress this way."`
`"......I may be no different from the image of a detestable witch that you humans hold in your minds.`
` However, I respond with goodwill to those who respect me.`
` Aren't humans the same?`
` Although, I doubt any human would respond with goodwill to a hostile attitude like that..."`
`".........My, ......my apologies...`
` I didn't mean..."`
`Shannon finally realized that her hostility was rude to this guest.`
`And...she finally digested the words that had been spoken to her a short while ago.`
`― You are no longer furniture.`
` Now, you are "human".`
`......The more she reflected upon those words,`
` .......the more Shannon felt as though {f:5:Beatrice} could understand all of her suffering...`
`"......You said something...um...`
`...about a reward...`
` ......What did you mean?"`
`"I say that I can arrange for you to be bound to the man who has captured your heart.`
` You can think of it as a form of gratitude for diligently polishing my portrait all the time."`
`"................................."`
`"Calm yourself. I ask for nothing in return.`
` I am generous.`
` .........However, though I ask for nothing in return, I do have a request."`
`Look, here it comes...`
`The other Shannon inside her heart sent her a warning.`
`{n}This is what she had been so often warned of in all those scary picture books she had read when she was little......!`
`"Do you know of the small torii and shrine that have been constructed on a reef in the ocean very near this island...?"`
`...Shannon immediately remembered it.`
`{n}When you reached Rokkenjima by boat, there was a torii and a shrine on a reef which was too small to even be called an islet.`
`She had the feeling that Kumasawa had told her its history, but she couldn't remember that very well.`
`...A traveling mountaineering ascetic or someone had built it, or prayed at it, or something.`
`"...Yes, I know about it, but...`
`...what does...that.........?"`
`"I will not explain everything from square one to a person who does not know of demons.`
` To make a long story short, ......it is causing problems for me.`
` ...There is actually a certain mirror kept inside that shrine.`
` I want you to break it."`
`That was a very suspicious request.`
`Shannon didn't know its history, but anything that might be stored inside a shrine would have to be something sacred.`
`......And she wants me to break it?`
`{n}Why would someone as powerful as a witch be unable to do that herself, and be asking a human for help...?`
`There was no need for Shannon to speak her thoughts aloud.`
`{n}{f:5:Beatrice} started talking about this reasonable question before Shannon could give her answer.`
`"The magic power of that mirror opposes my own.`
` ......I cannot explain it well with human words.`
` ...By way of example, let us speak of the differences between utensils.`
` That mirror is a fork, and my power is soup.`
` You cannot drink soup with a fork, correct?"`
`"If only the imposition of that mirror were gone, I could prepare a spoon perfect for drinking soup.`
` ......If only I had that, I could drink soup, or even dig my way out of a rocky prison.`
` ...I could even scoop eyeballs out, ......is that what it was?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"......I, .........I don't know what you are talking about.`
` ...If that is because I am uncultured, I apologize."`
`"It comes down to this.`
` If you spare the effort to break that most vexing of mirrors for me,`
` as a reward, I will grant you your wish."`
`"......I am in a very good mood today.`
` If you desire, you may change your wish, and I can give you all of the gold I bestowed upon Kinzo...`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"I, ...............I will have to decline........."`
`"......What did you say?"`
`When she heard Shannon's words, {f:5:Beatrice} realized for the first time that her expectations had been betrayed.`
`"If there is a reason, tell me.`
` If there is a misunderstanding, I shall resolve it."`
`"......I, ...I don't really know the reason.`
` .........But, ...until today, the island has been at peace, and nothing bad has happened.`
` ...So, even if I don't break the mirror, the peace that has existed until today should continue into the future."`
`"Hmm...`
` I see, I see, that is quite right.`
` It's just as you say.`
` If you don't break it, the same unbreakable days that have passed until today will continue into tomorrow, and the day after.`
` Why don't I give you an absolute guarantee?"`
`"Upon my name of {f:5:Beatrice}, I say to you:`
` {i:The same unbreakable days that have passed until today will continue into tomorrow, and the day after.}`
` And so forever, in perpetuity."`
`Shannon was seized by an eerie illusion.`
`The mirror was most likely something to restrain the witch.`
`{n}...So breaking the mirror should have been something done for the witch's sake.`
`......And yet, it felt as though Shannon had to do it for her own sake.`
`It felt like some premise had been switched...`
`"I have done nothing more than give you the opportunity to have your feelings fulfilled as a reward.`
` ......It's up to you whether you break it or not.`
` If you break it, I will grant your wish."`
`"If you do not break it, the tomorrows up until today will continue for all time.`
` Your wish will not be granted for all eternity.`
` ......Do you understand?`
` What I am saying?`
` *cackle*cackle*."`
`The witch was telling her.`
`She was pressing her, saying to break the mirror, if she wanted to be joined with George.`
`{n}And she was declaring that if she didn't break it, then her feelings would definitely never be fulfilled......`
`"...Please...stop it......`
` I don't...`
`...want to hear something like that.........!"`
`"To cause you pain was not what I wanted.`
` ......Well.`
` Feeling madness from love is the best thing about humans.`
` You should enjoy that emotion to your heart's content."`
`"However, if you wish to borrow my power, you can break that mirror at any time.`
` And you can yell my name and awaken me.`
` I will definitely keep my promise.`
` ......This way, you should have no complaints, right?`
` I won't force you to decide right now.`
` I take it that is easier for you?"`
`Was this deal ultimately something she could feel at ease with?`
`{n}......Definitely not.`
`To Shannon, who was burning with love, tormented by passion, being tempted forever by a way of escape was far too cruel a trial...`
`"I won't set a time limit on that promise,`
` ......but there is a time limit on the magic that can grant that wish.`
` ...That limit is not mine to determine.`
` It will be determined by your loved one himself.`
` .........Do you understand what I mean?"`
`"......I, I don't know."`
`"The limit is the time your loved one chooses the person he should pledge his love to.`
` ......I am a witch, but I am not a demon.`
` I possess no spell which can tear apart two who love each other, you see...?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"I hear that your loved one will soon be attending a marriage meeting...?`
` You may have stronger feelings for that man than anyone else in the world.`
` However, that doesn't mean that you are the most appropriate for him, does it...?"`
`"I {i:know} who he will be having the marriage meeting with.`
` That girl is {i:the most suitable for Ushiromiya George} in the entire world."`
`"She came from a good school, achieved good grades, and has composure and prudence."`
`"She is more beautiful than you, wiser than you, {i:more suitable than you}."`
`"Why would an ignorant, incompetent, uncultured girl like you be suitable?`
` You know better than anyone.`
` You are the most unsuitable!"`
`"Even imagining that you and Ushiromiya George could be joined is sinful, and foolish, foolish foolish know your place!!"`
`"Have you forgotten to be grateful for your schooling?`
` Know your place."`
`"George is the eldest grandson carrying Father's blood.`
` He's a person who may bear the burden of the Ushiromiya family someday in the future."`
`"To answer that expectation, he has studied tirelessly, entered a wonderful college, and is getting wonderful grades.`
` Do you reeeally think you're in his league, you incompetent, unqualified, uncultured seeerrrrvant?"`
`"*giggle*giggle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*ahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!!"`
`"Sto‐............stop it, don't bully Shannon!!`
` Who the hell are you?!!"`
`At that time, as Shannon held her head, trying to protect her heart from the blade of {f:5:Beatrice}'s words, Kanon ran in front of her.`
`Kanon didn't care who this woman was.`
`{n}As long as he knew she was an enemy tormenting Shannon, who he loved and respected as a sister, nothing else mattered.`
`".........Kanon‐kun—`
`stay back...!`
` This person is......!"`
`"................................."`
`It seemed that Kanon also realized that the being standing before him was the witch of the portrait.`
`...And also that she was a terrifying being.`
`"......I just wanted to make Shannon take her reward, but it seems I said too much, and ended up tormenting her.`
` I shall apologize."`
`"......But I will leave that promise as a reward to you.`
` If you need my power, call me at any time.`
` I have already told you how."`
`".........Well then, with that, let us disperse for tonight.`
` Hostile gazes may be pleasant, but they are bad for the figure, you see?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*..."`
`"Beat it...!!`
` I don't know who you are, but you're threatening Shannon!`
` Don't ever show yourself again!!"`
`It seemed that Kanon's words made the witch horribly displeased.`
`"......So, you do not choose your words carefully, lowborn?`
` ...I am gracious to those who respect me, but brutal to those who do not..."`
`While she still smiled, the witch's expression began to warp...`
`And an oppressive feeling that couldn't be described with any of the five senses gradually filled the room...`
`Even though they couldn't comprehend what it was, they immediately realized it to be something terrifying...`
`If you were swimming in the ocean, and something large went by in the water beneath you, you would want to escape to the land even before you learned what it was.`
` ...This was the same as that!`
`"Ple‐......please stop, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama!!`
` Kanon‐kun is still a child.`
` I apologize for his language!"`
`"..........................."`
`"........................!"`
`Kanon blocked the way to Shannon at the risk of his life.`
`{n}...There was tense sweat on his forehead.`
`In that moment, the witch certainly had Kanon's fate in her clutches.`
`{n}...She didn't even need to move a finger.`
`She had Kanon's fate so readily in her grasp that she could crush it completely with a single twist of her own smile...`
`Kanon also understood that.`
`{n}Which is why he was sweating,`
` and his knees felt weak...`
`However, {f:5:Beatrice} abruptly released that feeling of tension, and laughed.`
`".........Very well.`
` At your request, I will grant him special pardon.`
` ...Kanon, is it?`
` In deference to her, I shall forgive you tonight and send you off.`
` Be thankful.`
` Well then, we will disperse for tonight."`
`"............In parting, I shall leave a single souvenir.`
` Hold out the palms of your left hands, you two."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} grinned broadly, and snapped her fingers,`
` whereupon their left hands stretched out in front of them, and their palms opened, against their will.`
`It was a strange sensation, as though only their left hands had become someone else's.`
`It felt like their left hands alone had become puppets,`
` pulled by strings hanging down from the ceiling.`
`"Wh‐what......`
`do you think you're doing...?!"`
`Kanon resisted, but he couldn't take back the freedom of his left hand.`
`"Don't struggle.`
` It will not take long."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} held her pipe aloft, and from inside the smoke, gold‐colored sparkling dust hovered in the air.`
`......That glitter eventually became several gold butterflies.`
`The beautiful butterflies danced freely throughout the reception hall, creating a fantastical and beautiful world.`
`...And two of those butterflies alighted on the palms of Shannon's and Kanon's hands.`
`"?!"`
`"Ouch...!"`
`There was a sharp pain, as though they had been burned.`
`{n}When the two of them tried to examine their palms, there was no trace left of that inability to move their bodies, which had been there until a second ago.`
`".........Ah, ......a bruise...?`
` What is......"`
`On the palm of her hand, a small burn mark had been made, the size of a pea.`
`...Furthermore, it was shaped like a butterfly...`
`"Wha‐...what is this supposed to be..."`
`Apparently, Kanon had the same bruise on his hand.`
` He stared at the witch hatefully.`
`"It is a simple greeting.`
` I have no hidden motive.`
` ...It is nothing more than a bruise, so it will heal in just a few days.`
` It requires no treatment.`
` That is a mark so that tomorrow, you will not forget that I truly was here, and that I made a promise with you."`
`"............The impact of a meeting with me is strong.`
` ...Sometimes, at the next morning, people try to think of their meeting with me as a dream or an illusion.`
` ............You should think slowly and carefully, Shannon.`
` ...And you should probably take a good rest, look at my mark tomorrow morning, and try thinking again."`
`"I shall not force you into anything.`
` You should freely decide your future, by your own will.`
` .........However, to think that the object of your desire can be granted for such meager compensation...`
` It would annoy the great artists who write plays about blighted love to no end.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Well then, let us meet again when the chance arises.`
` It truly was entertaining to have a conversation again after so much time.`
` Farewell, furniture.`
` Ahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!"`
`{f:5:Beatrice}'s body crumbled like smoke and blew away.`
`...It was golden smoke—no, a flight of golden butterflies.`
`They scattered in all directions inside the reception hall, ...leaving a golden mist behind as they disappeared into thin air.`
`......After that, only the cold silence was left.`
`The extreme silence was enough to make both of them think that they might have been daydreaming until just a moment ago...`
`...Which is why the witch had left it.`
`{n}She had left a mark to make it impossible for them to think that this was a daydream.`
`As Shannon and Kanon thought back on the butterfly bruises on their hands, and the pain they had felt when those had been left,`
` they stood there for some time, stunned and motionless...`
`And from that day on...`
`......Shannon was tormented by days of suffering and conflict.........`
`"Eeeeeeeeeh?!`
` What do you mean "separate rooms"?!`
` Then, Shannon, you and George nii‐san stayed in different rooms on purpose?!"`
`"Ye‐......yes...`
` umm, ......was it that strange a thing to do......?"`
`Since Jessica's cheeks had been stuffed with chocolate‐coated chinsukou biscuit that Shannon had brought as a souvenir from Okinawa,`
` it all flew out at Shannon when Jessica cried out...`
`"...Sha‐Shannon, why did you even go on a trip up to Okinawa then...?`
` And even alone with George nii‐san!"`
`"That's because... I mean... Since there's a very big aquarium in Okinawa, I was invited to go and...`
`I...like fish and stuff..."`
`"No, I mean, like...!!`
` This is a young couple going on an overnight trip, right?!`
` And you're saying there weren't even any hugs and kisses?!`
` To say nothing of the fact that the guy and girl were staying in different rooms!!"`
`"As for ki‐kisses, no comment.`
` ...ah, but we did hug, though...?`
` George‐san's chest was warm..."`
`"That's not the point!!`
` Aah, geez!`
` Why do couples like this exist?!`
` Aaah, geez!!`
` It's so damn irritating!"`
`From Shannon's perspective, a lot of things had happened and it seemed to have been a very happy trip,`
` but it looked like the missed opportunity had left Jessica feeling greatly unfulfilled.`
`For a while, Jessica chewed on her souvenir,`
` writhing on her bed as she complained about their romance.`
`Shannon and George had chosen to go to Okinawa because there was a huge aquarium there.`
`That was because their first meeting had revolved around an aquarium.`
`Since they had started at an aquarium, having their first overnight trip also be to an aquarium must have held some commemorative value.`
`"This was your special commemorative trip, your turning point!`
` Your first overnight trip!!`
` Shouldn't there have been all kinds of progress?!"`
`"And yet!`
` Separate rooms for the guy and girl?!`
` A couple taking two single rooms?!`
` Aah, geez, really, what's wrong with you?!"`
`"...Err, umm, ......but we're both single...`
` ...George‐san says that respecting boundaries is good manners between men and women......."`
`"For hell's sake, this overnight trip was so you could overcome that, wasn't it?!`
` You're not at the stage of mere hugs and kisses any more!"`
`"Mi‐Milady, I don't know what you mean by that, but...`
` Geor‐...George‐sama was a real gentleman with me until the end."`
`"That is, I mean,`
` ......I also...`
`wondered if those things would happen, you know,`
` ...but we, we may be going out, but...`
`I mean, it, it's not as if we are married or anything..."`
`"The kind of things you seem to be expecting, Milady,`
` ......I mean, we must do so only after we properly make a vow in front of God, and, umm,`
` ......ww...we mustn't...`
` au."`
`Shannon's face was bright red.`
`{n}She was restlessly fidgeting, making a circle with both hands, then a chain link, continually intertwining, separating and making heart shapes with them.`
`Apparently, the dramatic progress Jessica had looked forward to hadn't happened,`
` but it seemed that it had been a very important experience for Shannon in her own way.`
`...So in the end, no matter how much Jessica envied Shannon or made fun of her, it didn't change the fact that Shannon had a huge lead on her.`
`"Aah, I want a boyfriend toooo!!`
` I can't believe you beat me to it!!`
` We promised we'd get boyfriends at the same time but you snuck ahead and beat meeee,`
` aarrrrrrgh!"`
`"U‐umm...`
` Milady, you are a wonderful person, so I'm sure you'll find someone even more wonderful than I did, before long..."`
`"Don't try to console me!!`
` Shannon, you traitor, get outta here, you suuuuck!!`
` *cough*cough*, *cough*cough*cough*!!"`
`Jessica threw several cushions at her.`
`{n}But midway, she had an asthma attack and started to cough pretty badly.`
`Shannon hurriedly ran over to her and took a look on top of the nearby side table.`
`An adorable basket was placed there, and inside of it was Jessica's inhaler.`
`Shannon picked it up and handed it over to Jessica.`
`Jessica's asthma attacks always came suddenly.`
` Because of this, she had to carry this medicine around with her at all times.`
`She breathed in the medicine, and after some time spent holding back her coughing, her asthma finally settled down.`
`Shannon thought this a good chance to leave, bowed courteously, and made to exit the room...`
`As she did, one more small cushion came flying and hit Shannon on the head.`
`She looked around, and saw that Jessica was on the verge of crying, half of her face buried in her last and favorite cushion.`
` That face was red and meek...`
`"......Mi‐Milady......?"`
`"Sha‐......Shannon...`
` ...Be honest with me...`
` .........Is my...`
`.........hairdo and stuff...strange...?"`
`"What are you saying...`
` I think that your hair is very beautiful."`
`"Then, ...then then, are my eyes strange, or maybe my nose?`
` ...Or is it the way I talk after all......?`
` Is that why I can't get a boyfriend......?"`
`"Of course not.`
` Milady, you are wonderful enough as you are.`
` And I think that your charm will keep on increasing more and more."`
`"......But, it's only me who can't get a boyfriend...`
` Saku and Hina managed to find one, but I can't, I'm the only one......`
` Is it because I don't have any charm after all......?`
` You know, everyone's gonna be bringing their boyfriend along to the cultural festival......"`
`"I was so sure I'd have a boyfriend by then, I've been grandstanding about it...`
` .........But I can't get a boyfriend to save my life.`
` I'm the only one, the only one......."`
`Before she realized it, Jessica was shedding huge tears.`
`Jessica hadn't really planned on crying, and of course, she felt like supporting Shannon's progress in love as a friend.`
`...However, as she had made fun of Shannon, her true feelings had suddenly gotten mixed in, and the tears had just poured out on their own...`
`...Shannon understood Jessica's innocent and easily injured heart.`
`Jessica's usual rough style of speech...`
`was all just an attempt to protect her own easily injured heart.`
`......As a daughter and successor to the Ushiromiya family, and as a girl isolated on Rokkenjima, the only person she could expose her true feelings to was Shannon.`
`Shannon understood that.`
`{n}So, ...she strongly regretted feeling a little too self‐satisfied.`
`"...S‐.........sorry...`
` Crying like this, I'm weird.`
` Sorry......*sniffle*."`
`"You are a wonderful person, Milady.`
` There is no way that a nice man won't appear for you..."`
`".........Sha‐Shannon, it's about time for you, right?`
` If you don't go soon, Genji‐san and Mom are gonna yell at you.`
` I'm totally fine, so get going...!`
` Heheh, sorry for crying like this.`
` ......I'm such a moron."`
`Jessica faced away as if to show she wasn't looking for attention,`
` and waved her hand as though to drive Shannon away.`
`Shannon took that as a sign that she didn't want to be badgered any more,`
` bowed her head, and left the room...`
`When her footsteps disappeared into the distance, Jessica lay down on her bed, still hugging the cushion.`
`...Her expression was still a little meek, with tears in her eyes,`
` ...but for the first time in a long time, she had a very, very quiet and honest conversation with her heart.`
`"I also...`
`.........want to fall...`
`in love..."`
`As Shannon watered the flower beds in the garden in high spirits, she sensed someone's presence.`
`She turned around, thinking that if one of the family had come to visit, she must greet them,`
` ......and what she saw was that witch.`
`"B‐......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama........."`
`"It's been quite some time.`
` How are you?`
` Has your relationship with your special person progressed since last time?"`
`As {f:5:Beatrice} sat on the rose arch, she happily blew on her pipe.`
`Sitting in a place like that would crush the roses,`
` and it might have been dangerous if you fell off the arch, ...but after all, this was a witch.`
`That was surely an unnecessary concern.`
`"...Ye‐yes.`
` Thanks to you, ...it's going smoothly."`
`"Naturally; my magic is instantaneous.`
` ...You may even be feeling as if your meeting was a predetermined fate.`
` But that isn't correct; don't think for a moment this has anything to do with fate."`
`"......I, ......I understand that."`
`The witch was calling attention to something.`
` Two things, actually.`
`That originally, her relationship with George had been completely impossible.`
`{n}......And that her magic power was so great, it could manipulate that fate.`
`Shannon had become swept up in these sweet days, and had started to fall under the illusion that all fate was revolving around her.`
`...But the witch's words made her remember.`
`Her relationship with George had originally been impossible,`
` .........no, might also be impossible in the future as well...`
`"...*cackle*cackle*, sorry, sorry.`
` It's just like a doctor.`
` Even though you rely on them when you worry about your health, after you're healed, you forget even to thank them.`
` ......Witches have never known thanks, so I couldn't help acting a little rudely.`
` Forgive me."`
`".........I have never forgotten my feelings of gratitude.`
` ...I was able to achieve happiness thanks to your power, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` ......And without that power, George‐sama and I would have had no fate together.`
` ...I have never forgotten that."`
`"Sorry, sorry.`
` This was not my intent; I didn't come here to bully you.`
` Talking rudely is just my personality.`
` Do forgive me."`
`"...More importantly, I heard it through the grapevine...!`
` You two went on a little private trip.`
` I'm sure it was quite fun."`
`"Y‐yes!`
` It was very, umm, ...fun."`
`Shannon's face suddenly grew bright.`
`{n}The witch laughed lightly, as though that transformation was worth money.`
`"Already the person of your thoughts is no longer an object of one‐sided love.`
` You are a pair of lovers now.`
` ......To a pair filled with love, that alone is all they need in the world.`
` A wonderful, ideal world, so to speak?`
` Huhuhuhuhu!`
` Even witches would be jealous."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} laughed pleasantly.`
`{n}That smile was without a trace of malice, making her look as though she blessed the lovers' secret meeting from the bottom of her heart.`
`After that day, {f:5:Beatrice} had shown herself before Shannon every once in a while.`
`Even now, Shannon still thought of her as a creepy being.`
`...However, she was also hugely indebted to this person for bestowing the magic that had given her the relationship she had with George.`
`So Shannon was trying with all her might not to be surprised or scared.`
`"Oh, ...oh, yes.`
` ......Umm, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` I bought some confectionery as a souvenir from our trip.`
` ...Would you, umm, ......like some?"`
`"Hoh???`
` A souvenir for a witch.........?"`
`It seemed that even the witch who boasted of living for one thousand years hadn't been able to predict that she would receive a souvenir from a pair of sweet lovers.`
`When she saw that surprised expression, Shannon thought of the witch as a friend for the first time.`
`"Hohoh, Oriental cookies made from wheat flour and lard.`
` To wrap that in chocolate in the Western fashion is truly a blending of Japanese and Western style—the Silk Road of confectionery."`
`".........What?`
` What's so funny?"`
`"N‐...nothing.`
` My apologies."`
`This mysterious witch, who surely held a terrifying power,`
` was chomping down on the treats one after another, making a sound like a squirrel stuffing walnuts into its mouth.`
` After a while, Shannon couldn't conceal her laughter.`
`"Hmm, a fine treat.`
` ......I should serve you some Dolce Vita from Nero one of these days.`
` Roses are the symbol of eternal love.`
` I believe a rose dolce would be appropriate for you now."`
`The witch was in a great mood, having enjoyed the modern treats to the full.`
`"Umm, .........here.`
` I truly can't thank you enough.`
` I believe you have done more than enough for me already, so I'm returning this."`
`The thing that Shannon had softly set on the table was a gold‐colored butterfly brooch.`
`"There is no need to return it.`
` If you continue holding that, your relationship should remain firm in perpetuity."`
`"......I may have been given the chance to meet him through the power of magic.`
` But I think the effort that will make that encounter eternal should come from the two of us cooperating together."`
`"Hmm.`
` ......So love, too, is like a rose.`
` Too much fertilizer causes the roots to rot.`
` Some flowers cannot be raised without hard work.`
` In that case, do as you wish.`
` You may keep it in a box, rather than on your person.`
` That is my goodwill, given to you.`
` It would not please me to have it returned."`
`"Ah, ......my, my apologies...!`
` That's not what I..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` No harm has been done.`
` That brooch is already yours.`
` If you treasure that as proof of our friendship, that would comfort me a little."`
`"You may hold on to it, and gain its benefits.`
` You may also keep it in a box.`
` If you wish, you are even free to give it to another who is worrying about love.`
` ......But you should regard it as important.`
` It would certainly pain my heart if you did not take care of it."`
`According to {f:5:Beatrice}, she had appeared several times in the past in response to a person's summons so that she could give them an item imbued with some kind of magical power.`
`...However, most of them, after they used that power to resolve their worries,`
` would quickly come to think of that power as creepy, and, forgetting their feelings of thanks, they would throw away the items they had been given with disgust.`
`"Which is why I haven't often received thanks for my good will.`
` ......Let's see, is this the first time?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`The witch laughed heartily, but it looked like a sad laugh to Shannon's eyes.`
`She herself had been like that in the past—no, maybe she was still like that now.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} was definitely a witch, with a strange and terrifying power.`
`Most likely, no one would go along with her if they could help it.`
`And even though on occasion they had relied on her strange power, it had undoubtedly resulted in fear more often than gratitude.`
`.........It must have deeply hurt the witch when that repeated over and over.`
`From the moment that she realized this,`
` ...Shannon decided to stop being frightened of {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`That had surely tormented her for over a thousand years...`
`Maybe she really liked the treats.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}, who normally spoke abusively, praised the black tea that Shannon served her, and looked to be in remarkably high spirits.`
`On such terms, the witch and the servant grew animated talking about the trip with George.`
`Shannon didn't know much about {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`First off, she was a ghost‐like being who appeared in unexpected places at unexpected times.`
`{n}And it seemed that not everyone could perceive that she was there.`
`It seemed that each person had something called a wavelength, and that there was a great amount of individual variation in people's ability to perceive the witch.`
`Only Shannon and Kanon could interact with her enough to exchange words like this.`
`...There were a few people who could sense her presence, but most people couldn't even feel that much.`
`From what {f:5:Beatrice} said, Krauss and his wife in particular had zero magical talent.`
` And no matter how much she followed them around, they would never notice her.`
`Previously, when Shannon had messed up and Natsuhi had gotten really mad at her, {f:5:Beatrice} had started playing around, hitting Natsuhi on the head with her pipe.`
`...Indeed, Natsuhi seems completely oblivious.`
`{n}But Shannon, watching that, had burst out laughing without thinking, and had gotten scolded even more.`
`"Then, ......what about the Master?`
` I hear that he has been doing research in magic, so I'm sure he would be able to notice you, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"............Kinzo is the same.`
` There is no one with a more pitiful lack of magical talent.`
` ...It's the blood.`
` He has so little talent, he is worthy of sympathy."`
`"..................?"`
`As soon as they started talking about Kinzo, it felt like the atmosphere around {f:5:Beatrice} changed.`
`She had spoken about Krauss and the rest's lack of magic talent as though she looked down on them, but she spoke of Kinzo in a different way.`
`Anyone connected to the Ushiromiya family would know about Kinzo's Legend of the Gold.`
`{n}...According to the legend, Kinzo had summoned the witch {f:5:Beatrice}, and had been conferred gold.`
`...In short, that implied she had some kind of relationship with Kinzo.`
`"So, you see, ......he attained that level despite not having a single scrap of talent.`
` ...It was through frenzied solitary study that he reached the tier of mage."`
`"That's.........something really incredible, right......?"`
`"......Mmhm."`
`The witch, who usually looked down on people, was unexpectedly praising someone.`
`...While she lambasted Kinzo, calling him talentless, she praised his efforts.`
`"And then, .........the Master summoned you with the power of magic......"`
`"Mmhm.`
` ......Well, I only answered the summons on a whim.`
` In this period where magic has long been denied, there I saw a being, without a scrap of talent, giving it his all.`
` It was just my luck that I'd decide to come and laugh at him.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`The words "just my luck"...showed that this had been a disaster for her.`
`Shannon hesitated over whether it would be alright to encourage her to continue, but {f:5:Beatrice} continued on her own, ignoring Shannon.`
`"The format and rules were all there, at least.`
` He'd mixed up a few of the procedures, but, well, in deference to his enthusiasm, I generously responded to his contract.`
` ......And I gave him a mountain of gold."`
`"Then the Master...used that gold and succeeded in business, and grew his wealth into what it is today."`
`"Mm. His talent in magic was nothing, but it seems he had talent in business and gambling.`
` ...Or was it because of his bravery and madness to stake everything on irrational bets?`
` ......Madness sometimes brings about magic.`
` Yes, if I look at it that way, maybe I can't really say that Kinzo had absolutely no magical talent.`
` *cackle*cackle*..."`
`Shannon felt like she was daydreaming.`
`While everyone in the Ushiromiya family knew of the story that Kinzo had delved into sorcery, summoned a witch, and been given gold, in actuality, it was all rambling that no one believed in.`
`And now the witch herself was telling her that it was true...`
`{n}Shannon felt a little flustered at this insane secret that only she knew.`
`"Then Kinzo, who had obtained a vast fortune, satisfied his every dream that could be granted in the human world.`
` .........And finally, he sought the truth of the world."`
`"The truth...of the world?"`
`"...The single element that makes up the world.`
` Kinzo, who had achieved everything one can obtain in the human world, wanted that, the final desire humans seek."`
`The single element.`
` .........She felt like she had heard the witch say those words before.`
`When {f:5:Beatrice} saw Shannon trying to remember what that was, she smiled awkwardly, waving her hand and saying there was no need to remember.`
`"......I underestimated Kinzo a trifle.`
` I truly hadn't thought that he would display such power."`
`"......And thanks to that, I'm in this state.`
` I've been sewn in place on this island for several decades now, without even a friend to drink tea with.`
` ...My voice reaches none I call out to, and I cannot go anywhere.`
` Such boring decades."`
`As she laughed in self‐derision, she tapped her teacup with her finger.`
` It made the clear sound of porcelain.`
`...Shannon didn't know whether the word "self‐derision" was really an accurate expression to describe the look on the witch's face.`
`Shannon didn't understand everything, but she could more or less figure out the situation.`
`{n}...And it was surely a topic that she should not press the witch on lightly, unless the witch started talking about it herself.`
`To sum up everything she had said up until now...`
`{f:5:Beatrice}, who had been summoned by Kinzo's magic, could not leave this island for some reason.`
` And she had lost her power and her form, living her days in boredom.`
`During that time, her words had reached Shannon, who never forgot to strongly respect the witch.`
` And she had made Shannon help her to regain her power, even if only a little bit of it.`
`...As a result, she had become able to drink tea with Shannon like this...`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, what in the world was that mirror you told me to break?"`
`"Aaah, that topic.`
` .........It seems that a lot of things happened on the islands around this area, in the distant past.`
` Bad things gathered due to that, attracting bad distortions.`
` It seems that a traveling Eastern mage or someone built a shrine for the repose of souls and sealed them in there."`
`"...That in itself had nothing to do with me, but unfortunately the foundation of that magical power was different.`
` It created a strong interference with my own magic, and was extremely bothersome."`
`"Is that how it was...?`
` I just assumed that it had been sealing you, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama..."`
`"I was not its target.`
` But it was a divine mirror.`
` As a result, my power was sealed away."`
`"......If I were to use food as an example, maybe it would go something like this.`
` Let's say that I have ordered some Western cuisine, which is being made in the kitchen.`
` However, when it comes time for it to be served, the seating is in the Japanese style, and Japanese tableware has been laid out."`
`"So the kitchen is unable to take out the plate which would be out of place, and no matter how long I wait, my Western food won't arrive—something like that."`
`"So I had you destroy that Japanese‐style seating, and return the area to a blank slate for a time.`
` Thanks to that, the meal I had ordered was finally delivered, and my power came back, you could say.`
` However, so far, only the aperitif has arrived."`
`"It will still be quite some time before the main dish.`
` As I am now, I'm even more faint than a fairy in a shoe store."`
`".........pf...`
`...ahahahahahahaha."`
`"Mh.`
` What's so funny?"`
`"Nothing...`
` I was just thinking witches' analogies are so interesting.`
` I never thought you could use food as an analogy to talk about magic."`
`"I had thought it to be a skillful description, if I do say so myself, and I certainly did not imagine it would be laughed at.`
` I feel a little offended."`
`A slightly sulky expression rose to the witch's face.`
`{n}...It would not have been a strange expression at all to see appear on the face of two friends as they enjoyed their tea.`
`"......Although I may not look it, I was known for doing extremely brutal things in the past.`
` ...I've gotten soft.`
` Now I can even have a foolish discussion while drinking tea with a human."`
`She was probably talking to herself.`
`{n}As {f:5:Beatrice} gazed at the sea birds tracing the horizon, she put her tea to her lips again.`
`"...The clouds have come out.`
` When the ocean loses its brilliance, it's nothing more than a gray puddle."`
`"You think so?`
` ......I think the ocean is a beautiful deep blue, even if it gets cloudy."`
`"............Hmph."`
`Maybe the witch had noticed the deep meaning behind Shannon's words.`
`...She laughed lightly and set down her empty teacup.`
`"......It seems that those things buried in your eyes aren't black pebbles anymore.`
` So?`
` ......Do you understand the feeling of furniture being reborn as a human?"`
`"...............Yes.`
` ...I didn't know that the world was this kind."`
`Since her relationship with George had begun, Shannon's face had grown brighter more often.`
`Her smile had made everything go smoothly, and had even changed her luck.`
`......Shannon made fewer mistakes in her work than she had before, and the family members' opinion of her was starting to change slightly.`
`Just the other day, Krauss, who rarely exchanged words with her, had suddenly started talking to her, surprising her.`
`"You've been making a good smile more often lately, haven't you?`
` Has something good happened?"`
`"N‐no...`
` But......every day is fun, yes."`
`"Hmph.`
` Isn't that good to hear.`
` Coffee is obviously more delicious if it's poured with a smile.`
` ......Could I ask for another cup, with that smile again?"`
`"Ye‐......yes!"`
`That had become a chance for Shannon to gain confidence in herself.`
`Of course, it didn't go beyond her own heart, and it wasn't so big a change that everyone could see it.`
`...But she had begun to change, bit by bit.`
`Shannon understood it clearly.`
` To know love was to gain a soul.`
` ...And therefore, to be born again from furniture to a human.`
`There was absolutely nothing mistaken in {f:5:Beatrice}'s words.`
`{n}......By knowing love, Shannon had learned what it was to be human.`
`"......These have been unusual snacks.`
` It was time well spent.`
` It's probably about time for you to return to your work.`
` Let us end our tea party now."`
`"......After all, it seems there are some who dislike your drinking tea with me, you see?"`
`"Huh?"`
`The witch gripped a teaspoon and flipped it with her fingers, sending it up in the air.`
`...Then, it was flicked by the fingers of some invisible person in empty space, and flew straight into a bush close nearby.`
`The bush moved violently, and Kanon came out.`
`{n}......It seemed that he had been there for some time, and had been watching their tea party.`
`The spoon was gripped in his hand.`
`{n}...If he had not been able to catch it by reflex, it might have hit him hard in the forehead and caused him to start oozing blood.`
`"..........................."`
`"Calm yourself.`
` Our tea party is over now, Kanon."`
`"How long were you there?`
` If you had called to us, I'd have poured you some tea too..."`
`"I imagine that you didn't want to interrupt a pair of women talking, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`".................."`
`Kanon kept silent, but it seemed that there was a slightly hostile look in his eyes.`
`...On the outside, he acted respectfully.`
` But unlike Shannon, Kanon did not trust the witch.`
` {f:5:Beatrice} rapped the table with her pipe, and the tea set turned into gold butterflies, which flew upwards in unison.`
`They scattered in every direction, and the cleanup was already done.`
`"It was fun, Shannon.`
` ...Let us meet again if the chance arises.`
` ......My magical power is still quite lacking.`
` It's tiring even to show myself."`
`"......If it tires you that much, never appear again."`
`Kanon had said it in a small voice, but it seemed the witch had heard it perfectly.`
`She giggled, but did not reply.`
`"Shannon.`
` Tell me more about George at our next tea party.`
` There are no snacks sweeter than a person's love life.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` I bid you farewell."`
`{f:5:Beatrice}'s body also became gold butterflies, which scattered in all directions and disappeared.`
`...It was a very fantastical and beautiful scene, like a blizzard of gold leaf.`
`For a while, Shannon quietly watched the witch's exit...`
`{n}Kanon approached her from behind, and spoke with a very different expression on his face than his sister's.`
`".........Nee‐san, didn't I tell you that you shouldn't hang around with her?"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama isn't that bad of a person.`
` ...Yes, she might be a little strange, but—"`
`"The fact that only we can see her is suspicious enough...`
` She isn't human.`
` Who knows what she's planning."`
`"Kanon‐kun, I think that's a little rude."`
`Shannon spoke seriously, which was unusual for her.`
`{n}...To Kanon, who knew her well, it must have seemed extremely serious.`
`Kanon showed almost excessive surprise at Shannon's style of speech, and remained silent.`
`"It's true that {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is different from humans.`
` She has a terrifying power, so I think she is to be feared and respected.`
` ...But I think it's really rude to loathe her just for the single reason that she's different from a human."`
`"............I know what you're trying to say, Nee‐san.`
` ...You've changed since she gave you that brooch.`
` It's like you're the witch's prisoner.`
` She mediated your relationship with George‐sama, and now you're indebted to her."`
`"...Don't say things like that."`
`"She isn't human.`
` We don't know what she's thinking.`
` You mustn't trust her.`
` .........And we aren't humans either,`
` Nee‐san."`
`Kanon's words became more serious.`
` ...Those words probably gouged at Shannon's heart.`
` Shannon bit her lower lip and hung her head.`
`"We are furniture.`
` ...Even if we receive names and are treated as humans, that won't change how we were born."`
`You are no longer furniture...`
`Those words {f:5:Beatrice} had given her, which had made her happiest of all, floated through Shannon's mind...`
`"I am not...`
`......furniture."`
`"No, you are.`
` We are less than human.`
` ......Nee‐san, you're acting like you've forgotten that, ...and you're just pretending to be human.`
` You should understand that yourself."`
`"I'm......not furniture.`
` ...I'm human...!"`
`"No, you aren't human.`
` From the beginning, we have been unqualified to love or be loved."`
`It seemed that Kanon's criticisms had shifted focus from Shannon's interactions with the witch.`
`...Shannon also noticed that quickly.`
`"I heard from Milady.`
` Seriously, what were you thinking?`
` I can't believe that you would go on a trip with George‐sama...!`
` You've forgotten your place as furniture.`
` You've just been tempted by that witch, and mistakenly believe that you became human!"`
`"Listen, Kanon‐kun.`
` ............We certainly are furniture.`
` Lesser beings, inferior to humans."`
`"...But if we were to gain the missing remainder...`
`...wouldn't that mean we'd have become human?"`
`"......That couldn't happen."`
`"No, it could.`
` If we can gain that, we won't be furniture.`
` We can become human."`
`"..................`
` .........Ridiculous.`
` ...As if we......could."`
`Kanon spat that out, ...but weakly, and turned away.`
`That was probably...resignation.`
` ......The baptism of days upon days of suffering being furniture had firmly sealed his heart...`
`"...You can too, Kanon‐kun.`
` ......You can become a normal human."`
`"...........................`
` Stop it, that's the witch talking."`
`"That's right.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama taught me.`
` ......By gaining the single element of the world, we can become human."`
`"No—nobody's human without that.`
` ......That's why people spend their entire lives trying to gain that single element."`
`"I have no idea what you're talking about, Nee‐san.`
` I don't want to listen to rambling."`
`"Then I'll teach you in a way you can understand.`
` .........Look, see what I'm pointing at?"`
`"......?"`
`Shannon pointed straight at the sea, at the horizon.`
`Kanon didn't understand what she was actually pointing at, and couldn't do anything except look between the horizon and Shannon's expression, which looked like it was posing a riddle.`
`"The ocean.`
` ......Kanon‐kun, what color does the ocean look to you?"`
`It was an all too simple question.`
`Kanon tried to guess the meaning behind that question for a while,`
` but since he couldn't think of anything, he gave his answer straightforwardly.`
`"...It's an uninspiring dark gray.`
` So what?"`
`Objectively speaking, the sea, laid out beneath a cloudy sky, could probably be described best by Kanon's words.`
`......But as Shannon closed her eyes and smiled, she shook her head slightly.`
`"It looks deep blue to me."`
`"......Is that what you mean?`
` Like {c:86EF9C:using the word {ruby:blue:"{i:ao}"} for a green traffic light}?"`
`"No.`
` ......The ocean is deep blue.`
` If I can see that, and you can't,`
` ...then...that's exactly the reason..."`
`Kanon bit his lower lip and was silent for a while.`
`"........................`
` .........I.........can't see it."`
`"Kanon‐kun,`
` ......stick out your hand?"`
`As Kanon stood bewildered, unable to understand what she was saying, she took his arm, and opened the palm of his hand.`
`Shannon softly set something there.`
`It was that magic brooch, which she had received from {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}The magic charm, shaped like a gold butterfly, which could fulfill love.`
`"This is...`
`.........her......"`
`"No, this is mine.`
` ...So think of it as me and treat it with respect, okay?"`
`"....................."`
`After being told that, he couldn't just throw it away.`
`{n}Kanon didn't know what he should do, and he stood there confused for a while, the brooch still on the palm of his hand.`
`Shannon put the palm of her hand on top of Kanon's, and the brooch was warmed by both of their hands.`
`"This charm holds true magical power.`
` ......I'm sure that it will teach you an important emotion, Kanon‐kun."`
`"...There is nothing her magic can teach me."`
`"No, there is.`
` ......So wear it.`
` If that's embarrassing, I hear it's okay if you just hide it in your pocket."`
`"............Ridiculous...`
` As if I'd be led astray by her magic."`
`Even as he said that, Kanon couldn't be cold‐hearted towards something Shannon was pressing on him.`
`In the end, Kanon agreed reluctantly to take it,`
` saying he'd prove that he wouldn't surrender to the witch's power.`
` Shannon smiled and nodded back.`
`"I'm sure you can learn something important from it.`
` ......And I'm sure you can become human.`
` And when you do, I'm sure that this ocean will look a beautiful blue to you as well."`
`"...Gray is gray no matter how many times you look."`
`"That's wrong, Kanon‐kun.`
` ......It only looks like that because you have no{0}{nobreak:{m:-5:——}—}."`
`"Huh...?"`
`Because of the howling wind, he hadn't been able to catch the critical part of what she'd just said.`
`So Shannon said it once more.`
`...The single element of the world.`
` She spoke once more of a world full of that element, where the sea was deep blue.`
`"I'm sure you'll be able to see a deep blue ocean.`
` After all—"`
`{a:c:Without love, it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}.}`
`".........Who is there?"`
`"......It is Kanon, my lord."`
`It was rare for Kinzo to leave his study.`
`{n}......However, that in itself didn't mean his noble research had been suspended.`
`He may have left the study for a change of mood,`
` but the thoughts filling his head were no different from those he had inside the study.`
`So Kanon knew that no matter what the time, speaking to Kinzo when he didn't want to be spoken to would always be a disturbance to his research.`
`"The weather is heavy.`
` Will it get worse?"`
`"Yes.`
` According to the weather report, it could rain at any time.`
` ......Shall I bring you an umbrella, my lord?"`
`"That won't be necessary.`
` ......You should leave me alone for a while.`
` If my children ask, say that you do not know where I am.`
` I am busy on a journey through my own thoughts."`
`"......Certainly.`
` Then, if you would excuse me."`
`During the time that Kanon bowed to him, Kinzo had already returned to his own world, and had forgotten that Kanon was there.`
`And once again, he began rambling to himself.`
`{n}Amidst those words, ...the name of that witch was repeated many times.`
`"......Ooohh, {f:5:Beatrice}...`
` My hand does not reach your smile...`
` What should I do to revive you—what should I do so that you smile at me once again...?`
` ......What is lacking?`
` My research? My materials? A catalyst?`
` Or is it magical power or luck or an oracle...?!"`
`"Ooohhh, {f:5:Beatrice}, what must I do to see your face one more time...?`
` Ooooooooohhhhhhh......"`
`As Kanon listened to his master's weeping voice over his shoulder, he turned around just once.`
`When he did,`
` ............right behind his isolated old master,`
` ......was the silhouette of a person that shouldn't have been there.`
`It was......the witch.`
`At once, Kanon, thinking that the witch must be plotting to do Kinzo some harm,`
` quickly ran back to Kinzo, trying to become a shield himself.`
`But when he saw the expression on the witch's face,`
` ...that emotion of his vanished.`
`Because {f:5:Beatrice}'s expression was one of...`
`...sorrow,`
` ......or maybe pity.`
`"You fool, Kinzo......`
` ......I am right here, can you not {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} me?"`
`Right behind Kinzo, as he repeated the witch's name over and over, desiring to be reunited with her more than anything else, was the witch herself.`
`And yet, Kinzo couldn't notice a thing.`
`{n}......Even when {f:5:Beatrice} tried to rest her hand on his shoulder, he didn't notice a thing.`
`"...Why, why does my hand not reach {f:5:Beatrice}'s smile?!`
` Is it the phase of the moon,`
` the period of the comets,`
` the alignment of the planets?!`
` What is lacking, what, what?!!"`
`".........It's useless, Kinzo.`
` ...Without love,`
` it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}."`
`Kanon took the brooch he had received from Shannon out of his pocket.`
`......Could he learn something that would enable him, too, to {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} what he currently could not?`
`".................................`
` Without love, it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}."`
`He looked at Kinzo's back once more.`
`{n}......The witch was no longer there.`
`The biggest event for the Ushiromiya family in fall was the family conference in October,`
` but for Jessica, there was another one before that: the school cultural festival.`
`Jessica liked school; to her, it was a place where she could let out the stress she'd built up during the rigid lifestyle she was forced to lead at home.`
`For the cultural festival today, she had formed a group with her friends,`
` and would be performing casual pop‐rock on a temporary stage.`
`She had kept on preparing and practicing for that, and was really looking forward to today,`
` .........but there was one thing that had been worrying her.`
`She looked at the clock.`
` ...There was still a little time, ...but she was uneasy.`
`Would he really come?`
`As she was about to breathe out a stress‐relieving sigh, her heart jumped as all her friends suddenly started speaking in shrill voices.`
`"No wayyyy, Hina's boyfriend's a to~tal stud!!"`
`"He totally is, right?!`
` He totally is, right?!"`
`"Rin, your boyfriend looks hella smart!`
` So the guy's a hard S with glasses?! Like, for real?!"`
`"No way, no way, my man's a gyaru‐o!"`
`"""*giggle*{p:0:♪} *giggle*{p:0:♪}"""`
`......It's not necessarily the case that all girls are like this,`
` ...but at Jessica's school at least, the cultural festival was really a boyfriend exhibition.`
`Jessica didn't have a boyfriend.`
`{n}She had many friends of the opposite sex, but no "special one".`
`...But Jessica was a little famous around the school, and everyone naturally expected that she had a fitting partner.`
`Furthermore, her pride had caused her to act like that was the case.`
`Through such acting and dodging of questions, she had somehow managed to keep up the bluff until this year.`
`......But for various reasons, she hadn't been able to escape this year's cultural festival...`
`"Jessie~.`
` Is your boyfriend he~re?"`
`"Hweh?!`
` Ah, ah, no, looks like he's not here yet.`
` Maybe he's busy with work?`
` Ahahahahahahahahahaha..."`
`"What kind of guy is your boyfriend, Jessie?`
` At least give us a hint.`
` What type is he?`
` What type is he?!"`
`"Awesome, he's a working man, right?!`
` Is he gonna come in a suit?!`
` Of course he's gonna be sporting glasses, right?!`
` Kyaaa!!"`
`"Heeeeeey, but you don't really have one, do you?`
` If you come clean now, I'll let you join me!`
` Let's both flood this cultural festival with teeeeears!"`
`"No no no, I do I do I do, I'm telling you, I really do...`
` Ahahahahahahahahahaha...!!"`
`Jessica laughed awkwardly, covered with cold sweat.`
` ...It was extremely doubtful whether she really had deceived her sharp‐witted friends...`
`"Yes.`
` Then, how about making a fake boyfriend and taking him with you?"`
`"F‐f‐fake?!`
` Wh‐who......?!`
` I can't think of anyone...!"`
`Shannon's ridiculous plan surprised Jessica wildly.`
`Even so, it was a little more realistic than the unrealistic method running through her head of getting a boyfriend in a huge hurry before the day of the cultural festival.`
`"For example,`
` ......what about Kanon‐kun?"`
`"K‐K‐Kanon‐kuuuuuun?!`
` N‐n‐no way, no way!!`
` And anyway I'm sure Kanon‐kun will have work on the day of the festival—`
`I don't want to bother him and stuff..."`
`"Of course, I've already checked the schedule.`
` Kanon‐kun has that day off."`
`"......Wh‐...why are you always so clever at times like this...`
` No, wait!`
` It'd be even worse if he's off...`
` I can't pull him away from his precious break just for my own vanity!"`
`"If Kanon‐kun isn't pulled away, he'll always just be shut away by himself,`
` so I think forcibly dragging him around a bit would be perfect."`
`"Y‐y‐`
`......you think so?`
` ...No,`
` but,`
` ...I'd feel bad for Kanon‐kun......"`
`"Then I think you're out of options...`
` How about meekly confessing to everyone that you don't have a boyfriend?"`
`"...Oh, sure, sure, that may well cause you to experience some shame,`
` but you would only have to endure for the short and yet oh so loooong time before graduation.`
` To those couples in love, there's no sweeter honey than the face of a single person with an inferiority complex{p:0:☆}"`
`"Sha‐Shannonnnn~!!`
` You aren't really worrying for my sake, are you, you're teasing meeeeee!!"`
`Jessica wrestled about with Shannon, her eyes teary.`
`{n}But Shannon was unconcerned, laughing with her usual smile.`
`"Yes,`
` this is to get you back for making fun of me and George‐sama all the time."`
`At that comeback of Shannon's, the likes of which didn't happen even once a year, Jessica rolled around on her bed hugging her cushion, writhing and suffering.`
`Shannon's triumphant smile was unbearably frustrating, but right now, she was the only person Jessica could talk with.`
` She could wait until later to suffocate her with a cushion.`
`"Why not, Milady?`
` It's a cultural festival, but it's also a chance for you to have fun with Kanon‐kun."`
`"Well yeah, but...`
`ahh, nononono......!!"`
`Jessica buried her head in her favorite cushion to hide the fact that her face had grown bright red.`
`And she bit away at her thumbnail...`
`{n}...It really was a reaction to be appreciated.`
`Shannon and Jessica were about the same age, of the same sex, and they were also friends.`
`And they were both right in the middle of puberty.`
`{n}They could never talk enough about things related to love.`
`{n}That's why they were able to be open with each other about these topics.`
`So Jessica had heard in detail about how Shannon's and George's love was progressing,`
` and on the other side, Shannon had heard the details of what type Jessica liked, and what kind of man she might be interested in.`
`Judging by Jessica's reactions, it would probably be crude to talk about that in detail...`
`But we won't get anywhere with Jessica just rolling around on the bed forever, so—to be blunt—`
`Jessica had been thinking about Kanon ever since he had first appeared.`
`There were almost no young men on Rokkenjima.`
`{n}So maybe it was natural that Jessica, as a girl in puberty, had become interested in Kanon.`
`But if anyone said that, it would destroy the romance of a maiden's pure heart and of love at first sight.`
`Shannon had been with Kanon the whole time at the welfare institute, so she had known him before they had started working.`
`So Jessica had asked persistently about what kind of person he was, what his hobbies were, what his favorite foods were, what type of girl he liked.`
`.........Even Shannon could clearly tell that Jessica was infatuated with Kanon.`
`"Come on.`
` ...Isn't this a good chance to take Kanon‐kun on a date?"`
`"B‐b‐but but but...Kanon‐kun might also have someone he likes...`
` Wouldn't he take it badly if I made him go with me just to show off...?"`
`"People who aren't honest about their feelings, such as you, Milady,`
` ...what was that word again, I learned it from George‐sama.`
` That's right, they call them "{c:86ef9c:tsundora}".`
` Apparently they will be quite popular a few decades from now, you know?"`
`"Wowww, George nii‐san sure is incredible...`
` So, he's capable of foreseeing future trends now, is he?`
` Awesome.`
` ......No, wait!`
` You're saying I'm living in the wrong time period!"`
`"Waah, waah, waah, I'm dooooomed!!"`
`......Ultimately, Jessica wasted several days before finally agreeing to the plan of having Kanon pretend to be her boyfriend......`
`"......Yes, Milady.`
` Did you call me?"`
`Jessica realized that she had called him at a bad time, and immediately regretted it.`
`...Kanon always had a sour look, but even so, he had some good days and some bad days.`
`...Unfortunately, this reaction was the latter.`
`"N‐n‐no, umm, well,`
` ............errr."`
`"....................."`
`All that confidence and effort she had amassed by practicing in front of a mirror all night was wiped out in about five seconds...`
`Jessica turned bright red and hung her head.`
`Watching her, Kanon sighed.`
`{n}...Jessica thought he was getting fed up with her, and her face went pale.`
`".........I heard from Shannon.`
` Is this about me accompanying you to the school cultural festival, Milady?"`
`"Huh?`
` ......Ah, aaaaaaahhh!!`
` Nice, Shannon...!`
` ...I mean...!"`
`"Ye‐yeah, yeah.`
` Tha‐that's right, but, umm, err!`
` ...............Do, do you have any p‐plans that day...?"`
`"...I was strictly ordered by Shannon to work specially for you on that day, Milady.`
` I have never been to high school, so I don't really understand,`
` but I hear it's a place where girls feel very ashamed if they don't have a boy with them."`
`"...And I was particularly ordered to see to it that the daughter of the Ushiromiya family is in no way inferior to the common people."`
`"Waha...`
`wahahahahahahahahahaha, Shannon, I'll beat you to death laterrrrrrr!!!"`
`Jessica kept yelling with a strange voice, a broken smile, and steam pouring from her head as if she were a boiler.`
`As Kanon watched this, he sighed again.`
`Kanon wasn't an idiot either.`
`He fully understood what Jessica intended by inviting him.`
`......However, in truth, he found it nothing but bothersome to go along with the lady's game of love.`
`But Shannon had spoken to him persistently about it.`
` He was very indebted to her for many things.`
`{n}He couldn't refuse.`
`...And in his pocket was that brooch.`
`Couldn't this strange turn of events also have been brought about by the magic power residing in this brooch?`
`............Ridiculous.`
`{n}But those words of Shannon's came to mind.`
`...What did Shannon {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} that I cannot?`
`I don't understand Shannon's feelings.`
` We are furniture.`
`{n}...As if we could...become something more than that.`
`Jessica, still rambling on in a strange voice, and Kanon, sighing deeply, were a truly odd combination...`
`"Jessie, someone's here for you!!`
` Didn't you hear?!"`
`"Huh, ah, ah, sorry!!`
` Wh‐who...?"`
`As my friends all gathered together, ...they were looking this way with hard‐to‐describe expressions,`
` whispering to each other in low voices that couldn't be called low.`
`Even I felt kind of shameless.`
` Did I just say "sorry, who"?!`
`{n}Like I don't know who's shown up...!`
`{n}Aaaaaaaaah, crap, crap, crap, my mind is blank...`
`"Omigod, that's Jessie's boyfriend?!`
` He's sooo cuuuuuuuuute!!"`
`"She really had a boyfriend?!`
` No fake, serious, for reeeeal?!"`
`"Jessica, you traitoorrr!!`
` He's soo fine!!"`
`"He's younger?!`
` I never heard he was younger?!"`
`"Where where?!`
` Where where where's Jessie's boyfriend?!"`
`"She really does like young boys!!!!!"`
`"He‐hhhhhey!`
` Y‐you took a while, wahahahahaha!"`
`"......I didn't know where the entrance was.`
` I apologize for being late."`
`"R‐right, umm, ...that outfit suits you, doesn't it?`
` Wahahahahahahaha...!!"`
`"...Shannon...said my normal clothes wouldn't do, ...so we went and bought this yesterday.`
` It probably doesn't fit me..."`
`"Wa‐wahahahahahahahahahahahaha, that's not true!`
` Shannon, when I get back you're getting a posthumous two‐rank promotiooooon!!"`
`".........This place is kind of filled with girls... It's uncomfortable."`
`"Y‐y‐yeah, isn't it?!`
` C‐come on, let's not hang around here, let's go to the stage, alright?`
` 'Cause it'll be our turn really soon!`
` Come on come on come on!!"`
`It seemed that Jessica was just as uncomfortable.`
`{n}It looked like she was finding it difficult to cope while bathed in everyone's interested gaze.`
`...When he saw Jessica's appearance, Kanon thought that he might have made things difficult for her by coming.`
`"......I get the feeling that I'm getting in the way.`
` Am I a burden?"`
`"N‐no‐not at all, seriously!!"`
`"...If {ruby:boku:I} am in the way, please tell me at any time..."`
`((Kyaaa, omigooddd, he calls himself "boku"!!!!!!))`
`"Ahiiiiiiiii, you, you, you aren't a burden, Kanon‐kun!!"`
`(((Kyaaaaaa, she calls her boyfriend "kun"!!!!!!!)))`
`"......What should I do, Milady?"`
`(((Omigoood, she makes him call her Milady, like a butler, {ruby:omg:ktkr}!!!)))`
`"Nooooooooo, don't call me Milady todaaaaaaaaay!!"`
`".........Re‐...really?`
` Understood, Jessica‐sama."`
`(((Kyaaaaa, she's trained him to call her "sama"!!!!!!!!)))`
`"S‐ss‐sorry, Kanon‐kun, just for three seconds, could you close your eyes..."`
`(((Hiiyaaaaaaa, kiss, it's a kiss, she's going to kiss him!!!!)))`
`"O‐...okay, here goes."`
`BANG,`
` thunk!`
` BAMBAM,`
` SLAM,`
` CRASH!!`
`...When Kanon opened his eyes, for some reason, there was a horrible tragedy in the room.`
`{n}Everyone had been driven into the walls, their arms and legs outstretched.`
`Jessica put her brass knuckles in her pocket before Kanon opened his eyes.`
`"A‐anyway, let's go over to the stage.`
` Our turn is coming up soon, so wait in a seat for a bit."`
`"'Cause we have to get ready!`
` If you go straight to the end here, there'll be a temporary stage, so you'll know where to go, just wait there!"`
`Kanon seemed to be having a hard time adjusting; pushing him in the back, Jessica sent him out into the corridor.`
`Even though Kanon was confused by Jessica's attitude and show of agitation, which he had never seen before, he followed her instructions and headed in the direction she had indicated.`
`After seeing him off with an awkward smile, Jessica slammed the door shut and yelled loudly.`
`"There you go, you saw, right?`
` You saw, happy now?!`
` Wahahahahahahahaha, sucks for you!!!"`
`"......ugggggggh, I lost the bet."`
`"I was so sure that Jessie didn't have a boyfriend."`
`"That wasn't a boyfriend, right, she's just harassing one of her servants, right?"`
`"Waaaah, Jessie's boyfriend's incredibleeee...!"`
`"Sh‐sh‐shut up!!`
` Let's get ready, move it move it!!"`
`Jessica took the brass knuckles out of her pocket again, and everyone energetically returned to their tasks.`
`"...............haah."`
`Kanon went down the corridor as Jessica had told him to, and found a temporary stage set up where the vending machines should have been.`
`It was probably being shared in timeslots between the individual groups and clubs.`
`A student group was singing, and the place was already fired up.`
`Disliking that ruckus, he found a dark wall to lean against, alone.`
`......So this is what they call high school.`
`{n}It sure is noisy,`
` ...Kanon thought.`
`Then he remembered Jessica just now, acting in a way that he'd never seen before.`
`......Honestly, she was in such high spirits that alcohol might have been involved.`
`To him, the greatest virtue for a person was to always be composed and intellectual.`
`In that sense, it was very hard for him to get used to the atmosphere in a school cultural festival.`
`...He had the responsibility of reporting everything he saw or heard to the Master.`
`...So he would also have to report about Jessica's unrestrained behavior earlier.`
`......At the very least, it was not fitting for a daughter of the Ushiromiya main family.`
`The Master, Krauss‐sama,`
` ...and especially Natsuhi‐sama would probably be angry.`
`If I were to report it in a way that protects Milady, should I blame it on inappropriate school friends...?`
`".........What was all that?`
` ......So stupid."`
`Kanon thought back on how Jessica had acted earlier, and sighed again.`
`He could understand Natsuhi's headache a little now.`
`......Come to think of it, Natsuhi‐sama, as the president of the PTA, should have gone straight to a social after attending the ceremony in the gymnasium.`
`Hadn't she said that she wouldn't be there to see Milady's event?`
`{n}......That was probably for the best.`
`"............The crowds are unpleasant.`
` ...What in the world do they want?"`
`Several female students kept glancing at me.`
`It seemed they were all whispering the same sort of things that Milady's school friends had said, and it was really unpleasant.`
`Come to think of it, didn't Shannon warn me?`
`......That if I was going to walk around a school festival on my own,`
` I had better watch out because a lot of strange people would come and talk to me.`
`"He‐hello~, are you by yourself?"`
`Just as expected, a group of girls I'd never met started talking to me.`
`{n}Their stares started to make my back tingle.`
`......Didn't she tell me some magic words that could chase them off in times like this?`
` ...Ummm.`
`"......Sorry.`
` I'm with someone."`
`"Uh, oh, really...?!`
` I, I'm sorry!"`
`Ah, it worked.`
` Instant reaction...`
`Well, that got them to go away, but it hasn't really changed the number of people staring at me.`
`"No, it's that kid, Jessie's boyfriend!!"`
`"No way?!`
` That kid?!"`
`"I can't believe it, I was sure he was fake!"`
`"He's so cuuute, is he younger than her?!`
` I'm so jealous!!"`
`"...............haah."`
`...No way I'm ever coming to a place like this again.`
` Kanon sighed for about the hundredth time that day.`
`As he did, the lighting changed, and the standing audience started cheering.`
`Looking around, I realized that there were suddenly a large number of people here.`
`{n}And unlike earlier, they were all guys.`
`With this huge crowd, I couldn't even see the stage.`
` Fortunately, there was a fallen beer case nearby, so I tried using that as a footstool.`
`And I noticed that there was now a new group on the stage.`
`The leader was Milady.`
` She had changed into stage clothes, and was even holding a guitar.`
` ......I didn't know she could play.`
`No, maybe she could.`
`{n}I have seen her practicing air guitar before.`
`Natsuhi‐sama wouldn't approve of any hobbies outside of study.`
`Maybe she was always practicing in secret.`
`...Come to think of it, she's been returning really late from school recently, hasn't she?`
`...Maybe she's been practicing at school, far away from Natsuhi‐sama's prying eyes.`
`It really is for the best that Natsuhi‐sama didn't come.`
` ...If Milady were to get scolded by Natsuhi‐sama after putting so many hours of practice in, she would probably be very dejected...`
`"""Jessie‐samaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"""`
`"Everyone, thanks for gathering here todaaaayyyyyyyy!!"`
`I could hear Jessica‐sama's forceful voice through the speakers.`
`...Jessie‐sama?`
` Maybe that's her nickname at school.`
`The students in the audience kept calling out that name.`
`{n}...I was a little aggravated by that inferior name, which was inappropriate for Milady.`
`Jessica‐sama was in great spirits as they kept calling her Jessie‐sama.`
`...They were all probably her fans.`
`{n}With her mike performance, she was responding to that and firing the place up.`
`{n}...It was almost like a song program on TV.`
`............At first, I had thought all this was frivolous, but that feeling now changed into appreciation—this was pretty incredible in its own way.`
`Kanon had never listened to music of his own free will, but he had often heard the kind of music that the people of the Ushiromiya family liked.`
`...Since that was almost all classical music, Kanon had naturally started liking classical music too.`
`...So to Kanon, the songs Jessica and the others were singing were...how should you say it...`
`.........very modern.`
`In any case, he thought that if Natsuhi‐sama heard it, she would probably faint.`
`But everyone looked like they were having a really good time.`
`The die‐hard fans, who had even brought pen‐lights, sang along,`
` dancing crazily with the exact same movements, almost as though it had been planned ahead.`
`On the stage, Jessica‐sama also sang enthusiastically, dripping with sweat.`
`.........He couldn't find a single element that was appropriate for a daughter of the Ushiromiya family,`
` ...but it looked like she was having a lot of fun.`
`"""Jessie‐samaaaaaaaa!!`
` Jessiiiiie, Jessiiiiiiiiiiie!!!"""`
`"Thank you!! OK, next up, we've got a brand new one for you! Don't Call Me An Ordinary Magician!!"`
`...I couldn't keep up with the atmosphere, but...`
`......anyway, Milady was full of life and looked like she was having a great time.`
`As I looked at Milady having a great time, I thought...`
`Isn't this what Ushiromiya Jessica is really like?`
`...Don't I know better than anyone just how badly life on Rokkenjima kills your own sense of self?`
`Then the time she spends, ...not as Milady, the successor to the Ushiromiya family,`
` but as a single girl called Jessica, living life to the fullest, must be very important to her.`
`...I worked close to Milady, saw her in all seasons, and I thought I knew everything about her.`
`...But that was only a single limited side of her, Milady of Rokkenjima.`
`......We are furniture.`
`{n}We serve on Rokkenjima, and end our lives on Rokkenjima.`
`...So I had come to think that Rokkenjima itself was our whole world, as though—just like in the old geocentric theories—`
`the ocean spilled off the end of the world into an abyss.`
`But as I looked at Milady like this, I realized that this was a horribly narrow outlook.`
`...I still couldn't keep up with the excitement of the crowd.`
`...But I felt like I had seen something that "cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}" on Rokkenjima.`
`.........Although I don't know if that was the {y:1:‘unseeable’}{n:1:unseeable} thing Shannon was talking about.`
`I still can't see the ocean as blue...`
`"Wasn't today the cultural festival at Jessica's school?`
` ...Has the principal been doing well?"`
`"...Yes, he seemed to be in good health.`
` Oh, that's right, Ms. Takamiya was also there.`
` She was particularly insistent that I give you her regards."`
`"Hmm, busy as usual?"`
`"It appeared so.`
` She is a very energetic person.`
` Oh, yes, there was also President Enomoto."`
`Naturally, the topic of Jessica's cultural festival came up at dinner.`
`School events often became social gatherings for influential people.`
`{n}It was the same for the Ushiromiya family, who were big names around this area.`
`As Natsuhi remembered the names of the important people at the social, she updated Krauss on the news concerning them.`
`...Jessica didn't really have any interest in that discussion, and rudely slurped her pumpkin soup.`
`"......Milady.`
` I would hesitate to call those appropriate manners."`
`"............Yeah yeah, sorry 'bout that."`
`"Jessica.`
` I am always telling you to do something about your speech."`
`"......Yes."`
`Jessica answered, discouraged.`
`{n}When he saw that, Krauss smiled a little and interrupted his conversation with Natsuhi.`
`"How was the festival for you, Jessica?"`
`"Huh?`
` Ah,`
` ......well, okay!"`
`"I was watching.`
` You did a good job."`
`"Huh, ......huh?!`
` Ah, ......ahahahaha, y‐yeah, I guess!"`
`Jessica's face turned bright red.`
`...She probably hadn't thought that Natsuhi would actually come to see her on the stage.`
`She felt a mix of happiness and embarrassment.`
`Actually, she hadn't wanted her mother to watch because she didn't want to be told that her music was inappropriate for the Ushiromiya family.`
`......But it wasn't as though it didn't make her happy to hear her parent say that she did a good job after watching her try her best...`
`"You appeared with both composure and dignity.`
` Fitting behavior for the students' representative."`
`"...ah,`
` ............oh,`
` ...yeah."`
`The smile that had been there a second ago crumbled like sand.`
`{n}...Jessica immediately realized that she was talking about something different.`
`Jessica was also the school's student president.`
`...She had no interest in something so annoying, but her parents had been pushy so she had grudgingly accepted.`
`Unfortunately, she was popular in school, so she had won the election easily.`
`So Natsuhi was praising her for the ceremony organized by the student council at the beginning of the cultural festival.`
`Actually, she had just carried that out halfheartedly.`
`{n}She had immediately met up with her friends, and had held a stage rehearsal for the rest of the time...`
`"The experience of standing above people and bearing responsibility will definitely be useful in the future.`
` It will surely help you mature as a member of the Ushiromiya family."`
`"But you spoke the greeting a little quickly.`
` You passed on content, but your fast style of speech dilutes it.`
` It would be good if you developed a habit of taking a breath every once in a while."`
`"............yeah."`
`After she finished eating, Jessica didn't feel like going straight to her room.`
`You could say that her room was the place where her parents had specified for her to be.`
`So maybe you could say that, for Jessica,`
` choosing not to return to her own room and instead disappearing to an unknown location in this large mansion was a meager form of resistance...`
`Jessica felt that even being in the mansion made it hard to breathe, so she went outside to the rose garden.`
`"...............`
` ...Well, even if she had come, she'd just have said something about how it wasn't appropriate for the successor to the Ushiromiya family anyway.`
` ...So what the hell's my problem.`
` Ahahahahahaha."`
`Jessica laughed at what she was sulking over.`
`...Laughed at what kind of words she would have had to receive to be satisfied.`
`......Ridiculous.`
` In the end, I'm just a spoiled little kid.`
`{n}I can't believe myself—it's almost funny.`
`"......Milady."`
`"wah!—Kanon‐kun...`
` D‐don't scare me like that, hahaha...!`
` *cough*cough*!"`
`Kanon had suddenly started talking to her just as she had tried to force a laugh, so she choked.`
`"What?`
` Something to say...?"`
`".....................`
`umm."`
`"......Yeah?"`
`Jessica's expression had become the one Kanon always saw.`
`{n}The listless Jessica from a second ago was gone.`
`If he still only knew Jessica as the successor to the Ushiromiya family, as he did until today,`
` ...he would have mistakenly thought that Jessica's mood had sprung back to normal.`
`......But that was wrong.`
`He now knew a part of her that he could not {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} until today, so he understood that there was no way that, on the inside, Jessica was just as she appeared.`
`"Ah... About today's cultural festival...`
` ...Well, thanks for coming with me so I could show off.`
` You really helped."`
`"......Your singing.`
` ...It was good."`
`"Wha?!`
` ......Ah,`
` .........ahahahahahaha?!`
` Re‐really? I'm embarrassed..."`
`Even though she had heard the words she had most wanted to hear,`
` ...Jessica became shy, and couldn't accept them frankly.`
`"......I cannot sing.`
` And I don't know how to play any instruments other than the harmonica and the recorder, which I learned in elementary school.`
` ...So I had just assumed that you were the same, Milady."`
`...Kanon hadn't been consciously looking down on Jessica to that degree.`
`But people playing unique instruments were always on the other side of the Braun tubes in the TV.`
`...He had got it into his head that it would be impossible for Jessica, at least.`
`"...I am furniture.`
` ...So I didn't believe there was any need to sing or play instruments."`
`But...`
`...I'm not sure anymore.`
`"......Kanon‐kun,`
` seriously, enough with that phrase "I am furniture"...`
` That's some kind of servant's mentality, right...?`
` That "servants should be living furniture" thing.`
` ...Genji‐san says it a lot."`
`"It isn't a mentality......`
` ...We really are...furniture."`
`"I know the kids from the Gospel House...receive assistance from Grandfather in various ways...`
`and I realize you feel gratitude for that."`
`"......But that doesn't mean...you should call yourself furniture.`
` Aren't you a human like us?"`
`"........................"`
`"Kanon‐kun, when you saw me singing, ...what did you think?"`
`"......It looked like you were having a lot of fun."`
`"That's probably not it."`
`"......Huh?"`
`"It wasn't that I looked like I was having fun,`
` ...you were jealous, weren't you?"`
`"...............`
` I......"`
`Even Kanon himself probably hadn't noticed that emotion.`
`{n}......Kanon had seen something he had never seen before, never known of before...and had probably become jealous.`
`And to trick himself about that emotion, he had called himself furniture over and over...`
`"I know I'm the successor to the Ushiromiya family or something,`
` ......and, well, I'm sure there'll be a lot of annoying stuff to do in the future too.`
` As far as that goes, I've just gotta resign myself to it—I was born under an unlucky star."`
`"...Probably, just like you had to live at the Gospel House, neither of us have a choice.`
` We couldn't choose the stars we were born under."`
`"...............That may be true."`
`"But there's one part where you and me are completely different.`
` ...Know what that is?"`
`I am furniture, and you are not.`
`{n}......He was about to say that, but stopped.`
`"...I don't know."`
`"Kanon‐kun, you think that your own fate is everything about you, and you gave up.`
` I can't accept this kind of fate, so I decided to do the best I can."`
`"......So as well as my normal constrained self who has to act as the daughter of the Ushiromiya family,`
` I've created another self who pours all her heart into the things she likes."`
`".........Another...self."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Kanon‐kun, you've been telling yourself "I am furniture".`
` ......I'm sure there's been many tough things that have forced you to tell yourself that."`
`"...I think that's...`
`...really unfortunate.`
` .........But for that to determine your entire life, that feels so sad to me."`
`"................................."`
`"You know, people can always make another self inside themselves that they can really grow to like.`
` This isn't escaping from reality, okay?`
` ......When I'm that other part of myself, I can really feel like I'm living a great life."`
`"So no matter how constrained and boring everyday life is, I can definitely live without suffocating."`
`"......To make...`
`...another self that you can really grow to like...`
`inside yourself..."`
`To make another me, which isn't furniture...`
`Through her relationship with George‐sama, has Shannon given birth to a part of herself that isn't furniture?`
`......And did this other Shannon...see something that cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen} by furniture?`
`"Yeah.`
` .........Well, I don't know anything about your private life, Kanon‐kun.`
` But, ...I can sorta guess.`
` Your private life is...probably...nothing at all.`
` Bulls‐eye...?"`
`Kanon couldn't reply, but that was answer enough.`
`He had no concept of a private life.`
`So Kanon would always be Kanon.`
`{n}So furniture would always be furniture.`
`"......Kanon‐kun, that "Kanon" isn't your real name, right?"`
`The Gospel House gave new students new families and a new life, so it also made a point of giving each of them a new name.`
`......In his case, that was "Kanon".`
`".........Certainly, ......that name of mine may be a temporary thing."`
`He had thought that he wasn't anyone other than Kanon.`
`......But he remembered.`
`{n}...There definitely had been a part of himself that wasn't Kanon.`
`{n}But that was far, far away, beyond the distant fog of oblivion...`
`"So even for you, it should be alright to have times when you're Kanon‐kun, and times when you aren't.`
` ......Maybe the Kanon‐kun you are when you act as a servant calls himself furniture and strictly limits his own will."`
`"......But when you aren't Kanon‐kun, I think it's alright to live much, much more freely."`
`Those words definitely weren't just lip‐service.`
`Jessica had also been like this in the past.`
`{n}She had cursed her own birth into an environment different from all of her friends at school.`
`She had been the only one in a heavily constricted environment, forced to learn various things,`
` and she had even received words about the friends she played with.`
`......Though she had been sad about that, she had given up, thinking that she had just been born under that kind of star.`
`But one day, Jessica had stopped giving up and surrendering.`
`Stuff like the Ushiromiya family customs and pressure, those didn't matter.`
`She created a real "Jessica" inside herself, who could do what she really wanted to do.`
`"You know, I'm called by this nickname Jessie in school.`
` So when I'm Jessie, I live life honestly and to the fullest.`
` And because of that, I can do my best when I'm Jessica too."`
`"...Maybe you too could have times when you're Kanon,`
` and times when you're, umm,`
` ......your real name, and live a different way in each.`
` ......When you aren't Kanon, ...can't you try being another self who you can grow to like?"`
`"..................When...I am not Kanon."`
`He had thought that his real name didn't matter at all.`
`{n}So he had thought Kanon was all he was.`
`And now Jessica was saying that he should create a new existence, another self that wasn't Kanon.`
`"......Kanon‐kun,`
` if you don't mind, tell me.`
` ......What's your...real name?"`
`"................................."`
`He was silent for quite some time.`
`Maybe his real name had risen to the tip of his tongue.`
`...After hesitating for a long time over whether he should say it,`
` ...in the end,`
` ...he swallowed it back down.`
`"......I forgot.`
` ...My name doesn't matter anymore."`
`Those words signified a slight rejection.`
`"No matter what kind of real name I had,`
` ......the only truth now is that here, I am Kanon.`
` The past has nothing to do with anything.`
` ......Just as it does not matter the name of the tree from whose trunk a piece of furniture was originally made."`
`"......I said stop that!`
` You aren't furniture, you're human, you know?!"`
`"I am not human!"`
`Kanon clearly spoke his refusal.`
`{n}......It was with a rage that he normally didn't show.`
`Jessica couldn't say anything back, and was struck silent...`
`"...You are human, Milady.`
` So you are free to live any way you like,`
` and any kind of future is possible for you.`
` It's almost like you have wings and can dance through the sky like a bird."`
`"But I am not like that.`
` Even if you see me as a bird, I am nothing more than a domestic duck.`
` ......They may have wings, but they cannot fly."`
`"To speak of that dream of flight despite that,`
` ......that's just...`
`too cruel...!"`
`"...Furniture, ducks!!`
` What the hell is all this!!`
` ............No, ..."`
`Jessica had unconsciously gone along with Kanon's forceful manner of speaking, but she realized that she shouldn't fire back, and swallowed her words.`
`"...............I don't know anything about you.`
` I don't even know your upbringing, and I don't know the hardships you've been through.`
` ...So I can't even imagine why you started calling yourself furniture."`
`"......But know this.`
` You aren't furniture or a duck.`
` You're a real human."`
`"................................."`
`"If you want to say that the Kanon‐kun working as a servant is furniture, that's alright.`
` ......But, ...in that case,`
` ......don't you think you can make another self for when you aren't furniture, when you're human?"`
`"......Only a human like you can embrace that possibility.`
` ...I am not like that.`
` I have no future, no possibilities, and no dreams I am permitted to see."`
`"............So, Milady.`
` Please don't...`
`say any more...`
`....cruel things......"`
`"Why...`
` Why......are you saying that..."`
`"Because it seems that you are mistaking me for...a human just like you, Milady.`
` We are different beings.`
` I just wanted to make that clear."`
`"......I heard from Shannon.`
` Something about you taking a liking to me."`
`"Huh, ......huh?!`
` Ah, .........no, wahaha..."`
`"...I look almost identical to a human.`
` Therefore, .........like Shannon, maybe I could delude myself that I am human, and for a time, pretend to love."`
`"...But that would surely be fooling myself.`
` No, it would also be fooling you, Milady.`
` Shannon and George‐sama will definitely fall apart.`
` ...Shannon herself must understand that day will come, and yet she does this...stupid..."`
`"There, ......there's nothing stupid about it!!`
` Sure, George nii‐san's a brilliant person, and he's bearing both of his parents' expectations."`
`"...And yeah, when it comes to marriage, I'm sure Auntie Eva's gonna interfere in a bunch of ways, and, umm, I think they've got a really tough road ahead of them, alright?!`
` ...But you know, George nii‐san isn't the kind of guy who'll surrender to all that!`
` He won't turn Shannon into Juliet, he'll definitely make her happy!!"`
`"People and furniture cannot love one another.`
` ...I am trying to say that even if you can love furniture, I cannot love you, Milady."`
`"..................nn—"`
`Those words of Kanon's......crushed all of Jessica's bittersweet feelings from today.`
`There was no way she could have anticipated the emotions of such a blunt rejection...`
`In an instant, she lost the willpower that had caused her to try and unravel something stubborn in Kanon's heart,`
` ...and before she knew it, she was just standing there in shock...`
`"......Milady, if your feelings for me are due to my conceit, then I beg for your forgiveness."`
`"...N‐......no.`
` ...Well, uh, ...I won't deny it."`
`"......Thank you very much."`
`"Huh...?"`
`"For thinking of me as a human,`
` ...thank you very much.`
` Just those feelings truly make me happy.`
` ......And anything more would be too cruel, so..."`
`"No, tha‐...that's enough.`
` ...Umm,`
` .........sorry."`
`Jessica scratched at her head as she spoke, and tried to force her voice to sound bright.`
`"......I just kinda...`
`...ran on ahead by myself,`
` ...and caused you trouble.`
` ...I'm honestly sorry.`
` I'm really sorry...for using up your whole day off."`
`"No.`
` ......I was also...happy that I could see you having fun."`
`"...Then, let's be done for the night.`
` ......If I don't go back to my room and turn off the lights, Mom will get mad at me again.`
` ...Hahaha."`
`"That would probably be most appropriate.`
` ...I wish you a good night, Milady."`
`"......Yeah.`
` ............Good night........."`
`Jessica turned her back to him, and slowly trodded away, looking disheartened.`
`But suddenly, she started dashing pell‐mell, and disappeared in the direction of the mansion...`
`As he watched her go, ...for just an instant,`
` Kanon was tormented by the feeling that he had just made a huge mistake.`
`...But, no, he thought, this had not been a mistake at all.`
`......It was for her sake that he'd been forced to refuse her now, while her pain was still at its smallest.`
`"............Nice going, making a woman cry like that.`
` *cackle*cackle*.`
` I didn't expect you to refuse her that strongly.`
` ......Had you answered normally, another pair of lovers would have been born with my magic."`
`"How long have you been there...?`
` .........You're just horrible."`
`When he turned around, the witch was suddenly there.`
`{n}...It looked like she had been there the whole time, enjoying their performance as if it were a play.`
`"I shall forgive your reckless words towards me just this once in deference to that pleasant show.`
` ......Even after one thousand years, no more interesting show exists than complications between men and women.`
` To me, it's an addictive pleasure sweeter than any other.`
` ......nn?"`
`Kanon pulled that butterfly brooch out of his pocket.`
`{n}It was the crystallization of the great magic that the witch had bestowed.`
`Without hesitation, Kanon flung it hard onto the ground and stomped on it.`
`"......Hoh?`
` What is the meaning of this, when you know that was something given by me?"`
`"Just now, I figured it out.`
` ......What you are doing isn't as tasteful as being a cupid of love.`
` You are just a demon who enjoys showing love to those who can never be joined, and deceiving them."`
`"...............Hmph.`
` ...You are free to think that.`
` Most humans I have lent my power to have said the same thing."`
`"Don't play dumb!!`
` You didn't lend Shannon your power because you felt sorry for her.`
` ...You took advantage of a weak point in Shannon's heart as it burned with love, and made her break the mirror that sealed you.`
` And that's not all,`
` ...you're toying with her, when you know very well how it's all going to end!`
` Am I wrong?!"`
`"Hehheheheheh, *cackle*!`
` Furniture is a thoroughly pitiful existence.`
` So you have no dreams, no future, and even no love?`
` Good, good, there is nothing better than knowing your place.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`".........khh..."`
`"Just as you suspected, there was a faint love growing in Jessica's heart.`
` You are under the impression that you have snipped it out, harvested it."`
`"......But did you know?`
` Trees grow thicker branches if you thin them out, instead of letting them grow rampant. ......A girl who loves furniture, interesting, truly interesting!`
` Shannon and George will also eventually reach a stalemate with their unfulfillable love, and will bear just the kind of large fruit I like."`
`"However, to my regret, they've been getting on so well that it just isn't interesting, you see?`
` In that respect, I think you two shall entertain me greatly, *cackle*cackle*!"`
`The witch laughed.`
` Even though she had known that the two could not be joined, she had lent magic to join them together.`
`However, they couldn't escape the fate that made it impossible for them to be joined.`
`......The witch knew that.`
`Even if they were joined, the relationships of Shannon and George, Kanon and Jessica would fail for certain,`
` and as they wandered through the eternal desert in the hell of love, they would be tormented by eternal thirst...!`
`"Did you think I would lend them that power without any compensation?`
` I'll lend a hand in love.`
` And my compensation shall be one ticket to watch the cruel fate that the two of them will eventually meet.`
` Even after one thousand years, no better show exists...!"`
`"Just look at Kinzo.`
` See how he ended up, an old, pitiful man who knew the taste of love and was thrown out of Paradise!`
` Look at how he lives, like a dead man who can't fully die.`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"You really are a witch.`
` Get out of my sight, you demon...!!"`
`"......I shall disappear regardless.`
` My power still hasn't returned, you see.`
` It is still tiring to continue showing myself."`
`"......I overdid it when I gave you lovers my power.`
` ...As I am now, it will not be easy to maintain that power without that brooch as a catalyst."`
`Kanon ground his foot even more into the stomped brooch.`
`{n}He felt it break under his foot.`
`Then, it dissolved as if into water,`
` and changed into butterflies that sparkled gold, which fluttered away from beneath Kanon's foot...`
`"I also find it a little difficult to continue preserving this form.`
` As you ask, I will hide myself for a brief period.`
` Just as there is no tide that does not rise, and no moon that does not wax, my magical power will surely become whole again.`
` ...And there will surely come a time that is appropriate for my revival."`
`"......I cannot imagine whether that will be tomorrow, next year, or even one hundred or one thousand years in the future.`
` But as long as there are those that entertain me, I will surely gain power and revive.`
` ......I will disappear for a short while, until that time comes."`
`"The bruise on the palm of your hand is already gone,`
` so if you wish, tomorrow morning, you can let my existence disappear like an illusion or a dream.`
` ......There is nothing more saddening for me than to be forgotten."`
`"However, I will definitely be revived.`
` Make sure that you won't regret that day's coming at any time.`
` I will surely have my second coming and control everything as this island's true master.`
` ...And at that time, the door to the Golden Land will be opened again.`
` ...The covetous and the greedy shall call me forth without fail...!"`
`"...Enough!!`
` Disappear, now, Golden Witch...!!"`
`Leaving behind a mocking laugh, the witch turned into a flight of gold butterflies, and scattered away.`
`...The whole area sparkled like a gold blizzard in a snow globe.`
`It was a fleeting fantastical scene that disappeared in a heartbeat...`
`The witch could no longer be seen.`
` ...However, Kanon felt like he could still hear that shrill, unpleasant laugh...`
`......Aahh, how entertaining, how entertaining.`
`Why is the human world so entertaining after such a long absence?!`
`Go insane with love. Go insane with gold.`
`Those that don't go insane from those are not human!`
`I see, then the word furniture is fitting indeed, *cackle*cackle*!`
`Furniture is created to serve humans.`
`And I toy with and tyrannize those humans to ease my thousand years of boredom.`
`What a truly entertaining rock‐paper‐scissors situation, that I cannot control furniture!`
`Kinzo, your enterprises are truly interesting!`
`Furniture, try and see if you can hunt me...!`
`Tonight, two seeds of love have been sown.`
`...Including the one already sown, that makes three!`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}...`
` Why...did you leave me alone in this painful world...?`
` ......I detest you.`
` You are yearned after this much, and yet make no attempt to answer... I will detest you for all eternity!"`
`"My lord, drinking any more will be damaging to your health.`
` ...Haven't you also been warned by Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"Be silent, Genji!!`
` You do not understand, you do not understand my grief and sadness!`
` Even though I believed that as my oldest friend, at least you would understand my pain!!`
` Why is it so incomprehensible to you?!"`
`"Oooooohhh, {f:5:Beatriceeee},`
` why did you leave me alooooone......?!!"`
`"..........................."`
`"Uuuuughhu!`
` Hic, hic...!`
` What the hell is all that furniture stuff?!`
` What is all that crap...!`
` Uuuuuuuuuughhu!!"`
`"......Ohhh, how heartrending, Jessica‐sama.`
` ...Even though her crying voice that I can hear from her room tells me of the situation, there is nothing I can do."`
`"...This is all a tragedy due to people who are too young getting too close, when the positions of their birth are too distant.`
` ...I can do nothing but understand Milady's feelings, and walk away quietly with silent feet..."`
`"...Umm,`
` ...wh‐`
`what...`
`......do you mean by that,`
` George‐san...?"`
`"I mean what I said.`
` ......I still haven't built up my castle.`
` Once I have, I will be able to think of myself as an adult for the first time.`
` ......When that happens, I want to marry you."`
`"......Tha‐`
`...that's, umm,`
` ......err..."`
`"But,`
` my heart won't let me do just that anymore.`
` ......So I want to give you an engagement ring."`
`"En‐...engagement...`
`...you say...`
` But, umm,`
` ......I'm...`
` ......f‐`
`............furniture........."`
`"That's right.`
` And furniture has to listen to what people say."`
`"...I am currently having a ring made that's worthy to be a gift for you.`
` I think I'll probably be able to bring it to the family conference coming up soon.`
` I'll give it to you then, so please, I want you to let me hear your answer."`
`"......If you accept my engagement proposal,`
` I will proclaim right there, to all of the relatives, including Grandfather, my engagement to you."`
`"Geor‐......George‐san............"`
`"I'm sure some people won't approve of our relationship.`
` ...But there's no need to look at their faces.`
` ...Because you only have to fill your eyes with me."`
`"I will definitely make you happy.`
` That, I promise you, definitely."`
`I look forward to seeing how it will ripen!`
`The gold butterflies do not swoop upon the juice of overripe and rotting fruit.`
`I cannot wait for the day of harvest to come! Is the time of the banquet here yet?!{n}*cackle*cackle*hahahahahahahahahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!`
`They had eaten breakfast at a coffee shop in the station building.`
`...By chance, the inside of the shop had been decorated with Halloween colors, since it was October.`
`It seemed that Maria had really taken a liking to that.`
`Ever since, she had been making a fuss inside the train about wanting to have a Halloween festival, without caring that she was attracting the attention of others.`
`Halloween is popular in Europe and America, but people are hardly familiar with it at all in Japan.`
`The shopping district was colorfully decorated with orange pumpkins,`
` but the costume parades of children demanding sweets and saying "trick or treat" were nowhere in sight.`
`"Uu!`
` I want a Halloween festivaaal!`
` I don't want to wear these clothes, I want to look like a wiiiitch!`
` Uu‐uu!"`
`"The family conference isn't for playing.`
` We're going to meet Grandfather, so you have to dress up nice."`
`While it wasn't completely full inside the train, there were enough people here that almost all of the seats were occupied.`
`Among them, Maria was making a fuss, kicking her feet back and forth in her seat, while Rosa scowled at her.`
`Rosa had told her many times in a low voice to stop, but Maria was taking no notice whatsoever.`
`...Once Maria gets this way, no matter how much you try to explain the situation or calm her, she doesn't listen.`
`In the past, Rosa used to pamper Maria and give in to her at times like this.`
`But, that had probably been the problem.`
`Almost certainly, the young Maria had formed the wrong impression that if she kept complaining noisily, her mother would give in, and listen to her.`
`That error had been brought to Rosa's attention through an educational book, and since then, she had hardened her heart so as not to pamper her beloved daughter...`
`But Rosa could manage less and less mutual understanding with Maria, and it had become more and more common that she felt discouraged by her own powerlessness...`
`"Halloween, Halloween!!`
` Trick or treat, uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"I'm not giving you any sweets!`
` You just ate breakfast!"`
`"Trick or treat!`
` Trick or treat!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`As Maria kicked her feet, a stout old woman sitting in the seat across from Maria picked a candy out of her handbag and gave it to her.`
`"Uu! Got a treat, got a treat!`
` Look, look, Mama,`
` Mama!`
` Happy Hallowee~n!"`
`"Maria! You can't just accept sweets from strangers, remember?!`
` Return it!!"`
`"It's alright, hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` She's a lovely young lady.`
` How old is she?"`
`There may not have been any malice in those words from the old woman.`
`{n}...But it seemed that Rosa had taken that in an extremely humiliating way.`
`"Maria! I'm always telling you not to accept sweets from strangers!!"`
`"Uu!`
` Uu!!`
` This one's mine!!`
` Uu‐`
`uu!!`
` No, it's mine!!"`
`"Let go of it!`
` Don't I always tell you to listen to what Mama says?!!"`
`"It's miiine!!`
` Miiiine!!`
` Uu!!`
` Uuu‐uuu!!"`
`"I told you, stop making that childish whining noise!!"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`Rosa reflexively hit Maria violently on her cheek.`
`{n}...In a flash, Maria started crying loudly.`
`Rosa immediately snatched the candy from Maria's hand and stuck it out towards the dumbfounded old woman sitting next to them.`
`"...Please, do not just give sweets to my daughter!"`
`"...............I'm, ...I'm very sorry."`
`Breathing heavily, Rosa once again held the candy out to the old woman.`
`...The woman looked confused for a moment about what she should say,`
` but then understood that perhaps her actions may have caused trouble for this parent and child, and she accepted the candy back, apologizing...`
`Then, Rosa finally took notice of her surroundings...`
`Her daughter's clothes were all messed up, she was crying and shouting with her nose dripping,`
` and there were many dumbfounded passengers watching them.`
`...Except for the sound of the train running, the railcar was completely silent.`
`Fortunately, that pitiful silence didn't last more than a short while.`
`{n}...However, in its place came an even more painful atmosphere as everyone whispered.`
`Maria shouted, cried, kicked and stomped her feet as usual, paying no heed to the people sitting around her.`
`...Impulsively, Rosa tried to slap her again,`
` but she noticed the cold eyes of the people in the train, and couldn't do that anymore.`
`When the train stopped, Rosa got off, forcibly pulling Maria by the arm, and almost dragging her along the ground.`
`As usual, Maria didn't stop crying.`
`Rosa took her to the end of the platform and hit her cheek again.`
`At the moment she was hit, Maria stopped crying for an instant, but before long, she shouted and cried even more than before.`
`Rosa, whose emotions had exploded, grabbed Maria by her collar, and pulled her hair as if to rip it out.`
`"Uu!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Uu!!`
` Mama, it hurts, Mama, it hurts!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Can't you hear me, I'm telling you to shut up!!`
` That "uu‐uu" of yours!`
` I'm telling you to STOP it!!"`
`"That's the reason you can't make friends in class, don't you get it?!`
` Get ahold of yourself!!`
` Why are you always a kindergartner inside your head?!!`
` Why can't you do what Mama says?!!`
` Why!!`
` WHY!!!"`
`Along with those severe words, Rosa hit Maria's head over and over again.`
`{n}The more Maria cried and shouted, the more Rosa hit her.`
`{n}And the more Maria was hit, the more intensely she cried and shouted...`
`"Mama, it hurts...!`
` Mama, it hurts...!`
` Mama, save me, Mama, save me...!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"WHY can't you just STOP that whining?!!`
` It's because you're like this that you can't make friends!!`
` It's because you're like this that Papa never comes back from his business trip!!`
` It's because you're like this that I...!!"`
`"E‐...excuse me, ...madam, is something the matter...?"`
`"Is there {i:something}...that you {i:want}...?!"`
`The one who timidly called to her was the station attendant.`
`{n}Rosa glared at him with a look that said "don't cut into the problems of a mother and child, stranger".`
`The station attendant surely hadn't wanted to talk to her.`
`{n}However, Rosa had been yelling on the platform for a much longer time than she had imagined.`
`...Her emotional scolding had caused the passengers on the platform to advise the station attendant that it would be a good idea to speak to her.`
`Rosa yelled at the station attendant that they would get on the next train and not to bother them anymore.`
`...And then, finally, or maybe we should say, for the second time, ...she noticed the passengers on the platform staring at her from the distance.`
`......Rosa sweated slightly; she felt the wind chill the sweat, tormenting her.`
`Maria was still crying, shielding her own head.`
`{n}......No—unless this beating stopped, she would probably keep crying forever.`
`"........................`
`......I've...`
`............done it again......"`
`As Rosa recovered from the evil heat inside her head,`
` ...she knew she had surrendered her soul to something bad again.`
`"Mama, Mama!`
` Mama, come back...!`
` Uu!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`Rosa fell to her knees and hugged Maria, whose face was all soggy with tears and mucus.`
`"......Maria... I'm sorry... I'm sorry..."`
`"Mama, ......Mama...`
` Welcome back, welcome back......"`
`Finally, ...Maria realized that her mother had turned back to being her mother.`
`{n}Then, she clung to her mother's body and cried, burying her face in her mother's chest.`
`"...Forgive your bad mama...`
` Forgive your bad mama...`
` ......I'm so...sorry...!`
` Please don't hate your mama......."`
`"Uu...`
` I'm perfectly fine...`
` Won't hate Mama.`
` ......Mama was just being possessed by an evil witch again.`
` ...But Mama came back, so it's okay."`
`"Yeah... ......Yeah...`
` ......Mama was...being possessed by an evil witch again...`
` ...I'm sorry, ......I'm really sorry......."`
`For a long time, the two of them hugged each other, asking for forgiveness and sending words of forgiveness back.`
`After a while, the two of them gradually calmed down and naturally drew their faces apart.`
`Maria's face, Rosa's face—both were deep red after crying their eyes out.`
`"...Do you want to have a Halloween festival, Maria?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ...I wanted to show the pumpkin marshmallow to George onii‐chan and Jessica onee‐chan......"`
`That was a sweet which had been alongside the cash register at the shop where they had eaten breakfast.`
`......It was a fancy sweet that had a big orange marshmallow in the shape of a jack‐o'‐lantern stuck on the end of a stick.`
`Maria had wanted that and had insistently pestered for it.`
`{n}...Rosa had disallowed it, saying that there was no way she would buy such a sweet right after they'd had breakfast.`
`"......Okay, then, Maria.`
` ......I don't know if they sell those in this town or not, but let's get off and try searching for one, okay?"`
`"u, ......yeah!`
` Love you Mama, love you so much...`
` Thank you..."`
`"I love you too, Maria......."`
`The truth was that they had no time to waste loitering around at a stopover station.`
`{n}If they missed the airplane, they would fall half a day behind schedule.`
`She should have left home with more time to spare, but she had ended up leaving late after spending too long choosing Maria's clothes.`
`...Because of that, Rosa had been a bit impatient since the morning.`
`She looked at the clock.`
` ...They should be getting on the next train immediately.`
`But her daughter had firmly joined hands with her to go buy the sweet together, and that hand was warm.`
`...To Rosa right now, it was more important to regrow her bonds with Maria.`
`...Maria was not only Rosa's beloved daughter, ...she was everything Rosa had.`
`Fortunately, she could see that there was a big supermarket right in front of the station.`
`{n}...Maybe she wouldn't be able to find a sweet exactly like that one, but Maria would probably accept something similar.`
`Besides, Rosa also couldn't show up with a face swelled from crying.`
`{n}She would have to fix her makeup.`
`"We might not find a marshmallow exactly like that one, ...but I hope we can find a sweet that's similar.`
` ......And let's surprise all your cousins with it."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...If it's a sweet I bought together with Mama, anything is fine."`
`The two left the turnstiles of the station in this unknown town.`
`{n}Maria walked across the pedestrian crossing together with her mother, feeling very pleased, as though she was walking in an amusement park.`
`Both faces were still deep red,`
` ......but warmth could be seen between the two of them, mother and child, as they smiled at each other awkwardly...`
`".........Dear.`
` What are you doing in a place like this?"`
`"Oh, it's you.`
` .........It's nothing.`
` It's just that this was a pleasant place to think."`
`"...I have finished all the preparations for today.`
` For now, shall we relax and wait while drinking some tea?"`
`".........Sorry.`
` I'm always pushing all my problems on you."`
`"...Please.`
` Can't you rely on me more?`
` ...I am your wife."`
`"......Naturally, I'm grateful for you always coming to my aid.`
` ......For that very reason, I am able to devote myself to my work."`
`"I understand that.`
` ......About your work.`
` ......And the topic of Father's inheritance, right?"`
`"............That has nothing to do with you.`
` It's nothing more than my greedy siblings scavenging for rotten meat."`
`"......It's alright, dear.`
` ...Everything will work out.`
` Your work has never once turned out badly."`
`"....................."`
`Natsuhi softly cuddled close to Krauss's shoulder.`
`She spoke words to reward Krauss for the difficulties of his work, ...but Natsuhi was herself the one who knew best that it wasn't going well.`
`...Krauss's enterprises were something like a seesaw where large amounts of money swung.`
`A big investment leads to a large return,`
` but the swaying of a large‐scale seesaw is large yet sluggish, and not something which shows immediate results.`
`At times, he would make more investments so that the seesaw inclined faster towards the good side.`
`......Naturally, he did that because he had the confidence that, in a not‐so‐distant future, he would be able to recover all the investments made.`
`......However, the seesaws Krauss chose never turned out as he would have liked them to.`
`...His foresight wasn't wrong, ......but times were slow.`
`{n}They never caught up with him.`
`For example, think of a literal seesaw, placed in a park.`
`Due to its great popularity, there was always someone playing on it, so if he wanted to play, he would have to wait a long time for his turn.`
`...And then, one day, he found that seesaw vacant, straddled it realizing he was the first to arrive, and had it all to himself.`
`However, ...nobody got on the opposite side of the seesaw, so he couldn't play on it.`
`And no matter how much time passed, nobody came to the opposite side of the seesaw.`
`The seesaw is a popular piece of playground equipment, so if you waited, another person would definitely show up.`
`......Krauss noticed.`
`The weather looked like it was getting worse.`
`{n}That's why nobody was coming outside to play.`
`But the seesaw is a popular piece of playground equipment, so someone would definitely come.`
`...If he vacated his place because the weather seemed to be getting worse, someone would definitely snatch his place away,`
` and he would end up only longingly gazing from a distance, at someone else having fun playing on the seesaw again...`
`On one side of the seesaw, he continued to wait patiently, all alone...`
`{n}That was Krauss's current enterprise, and situation.`
`"............If only I'd had a bit more courage, ...and the self‐confidence to believe in my own foresight...`
`I'd never once......have failed."`
`"...Yes, that's true.`
` Your foresight is never wrong.`
` ......You are the only one who inherited Father's gift.`
` You inherited an innate disposition that none of the other siblings did."`
`"......Yet, I was unable to believe in it!`
` I always closed my own projects like a coward.`
` ......Why can't I trust myself?!`
` Who would trust a man who can't trust himself?`
` Nobody!!"`
`"......I'm always sitting myself down in the seats where the losers must sit;`
` ......my father, my mother,`
` ...and my siblings, all of them sneer at me...`
` How long before I am set free of this complex......`
` How long........."`
`...Only Natsuhi knew.`
`She knew of Krauss's anguish.`
` As the eldest son of the Ushiromiya family, who would have to shoulder a big responsibility, he couldn't open his pained heart to anyone, and would always be compared to his father's great enterprises...`
`".........I have finished all the preparations, so you can devote yourself to the family conference.`
` ...All of them."`
`"............Sorry.`
` ......Will there be any problems...`
`...with Father?"`
`"No.`
` ......Genji and Doctor Nanjo are on our side.`
` ...I'll never allow those greedy siblings to meet Father."`
`"Hello, Gohda here.`
` ......Yes, please leave it to me!`
` I'm anxious to put my skills to work for the big annual job."`
`Ingredients of varied colors had been gathered in the kitchen, and the preliminary arrangements had already been started.`
`Even though it was still morning, the ingredients for dinner were already in saucepans and steaming.`
`Normally, he had to deal with several assorted matters other than cooking, but on the day of the family conference, he could devote himself to it entirely.`
`To Gohda, who was originally a chef, this was surely the greatest gala occasion of the whole year.`
`"Yes, dinner will be an excellent calf steak...!`
` A wonderful cut of meat is already in the refrigerator anxiously waiting for tonight.`
` Please, let the other servants know to look forward to tonight—I will not disappoint them either."`
`It was rare for Gohda to be in this good of a mood towards his fellow servants.`
`To Gohda, who boasted about being a chef who worked exclusively for the Ushiromiya family, being given the right to show off his cooking at the family conference was the greatest honor.`
`"......OK.`
` I'm leaving it in your hands.`
` ...Also, is Kumasawa there?"`
`"Kumasawa‐san?`
` I happened to see her earlier, but she is not here.`
` I wonder if she went to make preparations at the guesthouse."`
`"......So she's loafing around again.`
` ......No, that's fine.`
` Alright then, I'm counting on you."`
`"Yes, leave everything to me...!"`
`Genji placed the telephone back on the receiver, sighing lightly.`
`Thinking of Kumasawa, who was no doubt hiding and slacking off even though things were this busy,`
` and the ostentatious Gohda, who only felt like doing anything on a day when he could show off, Genji sighed once again.`
`"Excuse me.`
` All the rooms in the guesthouse have been prepared."`
`"......We received instructions from Milady to make preparations for four people so that the children can stay there—what shall we do?"`
`"...I hear Battler‐sama is coming this year for the first time in six years.`
` I guess Milady wants to stay up late with the other three cousins.`
` ......Get them ready.`
` No need to tell Madam."`
`"I see.`
` Certainly."`
`"......So tonight, we'll have the late‐night shift, followed immediately by the morning shift tomorrow.`
` It looks like these two days will be tiresome."`
`"Speaking of that, the weather forecast is saying a typhoon will strike right over here...`
` Will that be alright?"`
`"...Unless the typhoon diverts greatly, it may affect the family's boat trip back, depending on circumstances.`
` The family conference schedule may drag on until about Monday or Tuesday.`
` ......It will probably be a long haul, but I ask you both to be careful not to make any blunders."`
`"............Shannon, relax and don't panic.`
` Kanon, be sure to greet them with courtesy."`
`"......Y‐yes.`
` I'll be careful."`
`"...I'll be careful."`
`"Today we will be entertaining a very important guest.`
` ...Make extra sure that everything goes smoothly."`
`"......I understand fully.`
` ...Any guest who visits here is important."`
`"Kanon.`
` ......We welcome, today,`
` an {i:important guest} in the truest sense.`
` Make sure you're prepared."`
`"......Yes."`
`".........Shannon, what's wrong?`
` ...You've been looking restless... Did you promise to be somewhere?"`
`"Huh?`
` N‐no, it's nothing.`
` My apologies..."`
`"Nee‐san.`
` An important guest will be arriving today.`
` ...Detach yourself from your private life."`
`"I don't, ...I don't know what you mean by private life..."`
`As Shannon blushed just a bit, she turned her gaze away from the clock.`
`......Was it about time for the airplane carrying the family to arrive at Niijima?`
`{n}...She had thought she had been hiding the fact that her long‐awaited reunion with George was making her heart palpitate, but Kanon, who stood at her side, understood her perfectly.`
`".........Shannon, please accept this from me without a word...!"`
`...Inside a bathroom stall, George was practicing something over and over, taking out a small velvet box hidden in his pocket like a quick‐draw desert gunman.`
`"That's not it...`
` Shannon likes a man with traction.`
` It, it must have a more powerful feel to it...!"`
`"Shannon, put this on your ring finger.`
` ...Tha‐that's an order, okay...?"`
`"Aah, if I don't say properly that it's on the left hand, maybe she'll put it on the right hand!`
` N‐no, Shannon isn't that ignorant,`
` aaah, but, if there's no free will, that'd be a little, I mean,`
` uuuuuu, nnnnuuuuuuu, muuuuuuuaaaaaaaaahhhh...!!"`
`As he crossed his arms, moaning and groaning, someone knocked on the door.`
`{n}George was startled back to reality.`
`"Hey, George‐kun.`
` You alright?`
` Got a stomachache or something?"`
`"Ah, ahahahaha, Uncle Rudolf...!`
` It's alright, I'm fine!`
` No need to worry, ahahahahahaha...!"`
`"You sure...?`
` OK then.`
` Don't strain too much.`
` Your ass'll burst."`
`Rudolf washed his hands, laughing cheerfully, and left.`
`...George knew that the most embarrassing part hadn't been overheard, and he patted his chest in relief...`
`"Kyrie, isn't Rosa here yet?"`
`"Not yet.`
` She's pretty late."`
`"It's a good thing the weather's delaying our flight.`
` If the schedule had been like normal, she'd've missed the plane by now.`
` What would she have done then?"`
`"...Rosa‐san is an adult now.`
` She'd manage it somehow.`
` No matter how old they get, older brothers always treat their younger sisters like children."`
`"Dad's always a kid, no matter how old he gets."`
`"What'd you say? If I'm a kid, that'd make you a baby.`
` Come on, Battler‐chan, up ya go~!"`
`"Stop it, that tickles, wahahaha, stooop!"`
`"You two look more like a couple of naughty kids than a father and son.`
` ...Look, she's here."`
`"Ohoooooooooh!!!`
` If it isn't Rosa‐san!`
` Maria‐chan, long time no see!!"`
`"Long time no seee!`
` Uu!"`
`"Maria!`
` Shouldn't that be "It's good to see you again"?`
` Greet your uncle properly."`
`"Uu.`
` It's...good to see you again..."`
`"There you go!`
` Well said!`
` How about some candy as a reward?!`
` ......Oh, huh?`
` Where'd I put 'em..."`
`"Rosa‐san, it's good to see you again.`
` It's good to see you too, Maria‐chan."`
`"It's been too long, Kyrie nee‐san, Hideyoshi nii‐san.`
` ...And......oh my, Battler‐kun?!`
` Look how big you've gotten...!"`
`"Ah, come on, hahaha...`
` It's embarrassing hearing that from every person I meet...!"`
`"Hey, Rosa.`
` You're late.`
` If the plane was on time, you'd barely have made it..."`
`"I'm sorry.`
` We had some trouble making our train connection.`
` So we're waiting on the weather yet again?"`
`"Oh, don't complain.`
` I much prefer the thirty‐minute plane trip to spending six hours bouncing about on a boat.`
` Even if we're kept waiting here for an hour, it's still much faster overall."`
`"Is that Maria...?`
` She sure has gotten big...`
` She's at that growing age..."`
`"You last met her...six years ago?`
` Of course she'd change.`
` Women are creatures who can be born anew in a single day, and all it takes is a change of heart."`
`"......Uu?"`
`Maria noticed a big man who she didn't remember mixed among the relatives, and hid behind Rosa's back, glaring at Battler.`
`"Hey, Battler, say hi.`
` The last time you met her, she was just three years old, so this might as well be the first time."`
`"Yeah, I guess she wouldn't remember if she was three!`
` Hey Maria, long time no see.`
` You sure have gotten big!"`
`"Maria.`
` This is Battler onii‐chan.`
` Uncle Rudolf's son.`
` ...Understand?"`
`"............Uncle's son is...`
` Uncle's the son...`
` ............??`
` ......Uuuu!!"`
`She was obviously on her guard.`
`{n}She must have found it frightening for a large guy like Battler to suddenly start speaking frankly to her.`
`Battler noticed that as well, and thought of various ways he might approach her.`
`Then, he noticed the sweet she had in her hand.`
`It was the jack‐o'‐lantern sweet that Rosa had bought for her.`
`"Oh, right, it's October, so that must be for Halloween.`
` Ihihihi, trick or treee~at!"`
`If you try to take a treat away from a small child, normally, you'd expect them to cry and start a fuss.`
`The adults thought that method wasn't good, but surprisingly, Maria looked pleased, her face splitting into a wide grin.`
`"Halloween, Halloween!!`
` See, Mama, Battler knows about Halloween too, see, see!!"`
`"Hey, call him Battler onii‐chan!`
` Sorry, Battler‐kun."`
`"No, no, I don't care.`
` Call me Battler.`
` And I'll call you Maria, too.`
` Come on, Maria, it's Halloween!`
` Trick or treeee~at!!"`
`"Trick or treeee~at!!`
` Kyahahaha, *giggle*giggle*!!"`
`From inside her handbag, Maria picked out a jack‐o'‐lantern sweet identical to the one she had in her hand, and presented it to Battler.`
`It seemed that Battler accepting it was enough to confirm their friendship.`
`The adults felt admiration at how children have their own ways of communicating.`
`To Maria, who had been complaining that she wanted to have a Halloween festival,`
` it must have felt like Battler was a friend, since he knew about trick or treat.`
`Her defensive posture from before was completely gone.`
`{n}Now, she was all merry, as though they had been friends for decades.`
`"Yeah, Halloween's a minor event in Japan, isn't it...`
` You often see people parading around in costume on the news over there, but I've never seen it in Japan."`
`"I wanted to wear a costume too.`
` Wanted to do trick or treat with all the cousins wearing costumes..."`
`"Yeah, I bet you did. Let's us two do it together sometime!`
` What would you want to go around as?"`
`"A witch!!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}!"`
`"Oh, Milady, what are you doing in such a place?`
` Madam was looking for you."`
`"I'm here 'cause I don't {i:want} to be found.`
` ...I bet she only wants to nag at me anyway, all that crap like "is your appearance alright?" and "mind how you speak"."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` Without a doubt."`
`"......You know.`
` When the day of the family conference comes, for some reason, I start getting weird feelings about this witch."`
`"Hoh...`
` Whyever do you say that...?"`
`"The family conference is the day when everyone related to Grandfather gathers.`
` ......Like, I hear Battler's coming for the first time in six years, this year.`
` ...Same kind of thing.`
` I always wonder whether some "relative" who hasn't shown themselves for several decades might suddenly turn up."`
`"............Hohoh.`
` Could a relative like that exist...?"`
`"I'm talking about that {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` ......Nobody knows her background.`
` Could she be Grandfather's mistress from long ago?`
` ......Maybe one of her descendants will suddenly show up and tell us to give back the gold we were granted or something, you know?"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` Krauss‐sama and the others will probably have a discussion about the problem of the Master's inheritance this year too.`
` ...With such excitement abound over talk of the witch's gold, I don't suppose it would be strange at all if the witch herself who granted that gold finally made her appearance."`
`"Kumasawa‐san, you know,`
` ...sure, you're always quitting one moment and working the next, but you've been here as long as Genji‐san, right?`
` ......You know more, about {f:5:Beatrice}, don't you?"`
`"......Well, I wonder.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` Even if I try to remember, this old woman here can't even recall what she had for breakfast this morning..."`
`"Kumasawa‐san, you're always escaping with those excuses, but you know something, right?`
` Sometimes I feel a kinda devious atmosphere about you, like you know something and you're laughing behind our backs..."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho... How harsh.`
` ...I don't have any secrets.`
` ......The only thing I can say...`
`is that {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is the Golden Witch, and that she is the other master who controls the night of this island."`
`"That's second‐hand talk from Grandfather.`
` Even though you get paid, it must be a pain to go along with Grandfather's tales."`
`"......But, I can say this much."`
`"...What?"`
`"......In ancient times, Rokkenjima was feared, and called "{ruby:Azuki Bean Island:Azukijima}".`
` The story told among the fishermen is that "Azuki" was a mispronounced form of "Akujiki", and in fact it was called "{ruby:Evil Appetite Island:Akujikijima}"."`
`"I've heard this before.`
` It's that story about how, 'cause of all the sunken rocks and shipwrecks around here, the fishermen got afraid and stayed away as much as they could, right?"`
`"......Evil spirits had settled down in Akujikijima, devouring human souls from time immemorial.`
` ...There were all too many people who got involved with this island and were dispossessed of their lives."`
`"And it all settled down when a traveling mountain ascetic or someone built that shrine and laid those souls to rest, right?`
` ...What a shady story."`
`"They say that shrine was destroyed by an eerie violet thunderbolt this summer, which tore through the darkness of the night..."`
`"Kumasawa‐san, you really like those stories, don't you?`
` Sure, it'd be pretty creepy if a thunderbolt wiped out the shrine keeping the dead at peace.`
` But, well, it was all worn out from the start.`
` I bet it just got carried away by some large wave.`
` Hahahahaha."`
`"The evil spirits of Akujikijima woke up from their sleep, and summoned {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` .........So if {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama ever happened to come for the family conference, then..."`
`"Then...?"`
`Kumasawa kept silent for a moment there.`
`{n}...Jessica, who wanted her to keep going, found that silence very eerie.`
`Once Kumasawa was satisfied that she had spooked Jessica just the right amount, she grinned broadly.`
`"Well now, I wonder what would happen.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho..."`
`"Whoa, that sounds wonderful."`
`"It does, doesn't it?`
` Isn't it useful for your work to enrich your heart and have an elegant time every once in a while...?"`
`"I think so.`
` The heart and the wallet must be rich.`
` Got it, I'll keep that day open.`
` Please, make the reservations."`
`"Will do.`
` No backing out!"`
`"Yeah, let's make it happen.`
` I love you, Kyrie."`
`After kissing the receiver, Rudolf hung up.`
`...In front of his seat, there were many executives with their sleeves rolled up, eagerly awaiting the end of that phone call.`
`"Sorry about the wait.`
` Have we had contact from America?"`
`"Yes.`
` It's from our lawyer Dale Watanabe on the external line.`
` I'll transfer it."`
`"......Overall, how do you feel about the situation?"`
`"Well, I'm afraid......it seems it is not all that favorable.`
` It seems they have no plans of withdrawing from the trial."`
`"......Looks like we can't fool 'em after all.`
` Tahaha...`
` Please, transfer it here."`
`"Very well.`
` Right away."`
`The executive ordered the secretarial office to connect him to the external line.`
`{n}Immediately, the telephone in front of Rudolf started ringing.`
`"Hello.`
` <Hello, hello>!`
` Apologies for the wait, Ushiromiya speaking.`
` Good day, good day.`
` How is it going over there?"`
`"<Hello, President Ushiromiya>.`
` Let's skip the greetings and get right down to business.`
` I have good news and bad news; which one shall we start with?"`
`"...The bad news can go first.`
` I can't fight if there's no dessert."`
`"Very well.`
` The bad news is that they have started preparing to prosecute us.`
` Just a few days ago, a verdict was handed down in a similar trial, overwhelmingly in favor of the plaintiff.`
` The defendants were also making roughly the same arguments as us, but they were rejected in everything."`
`"I'm afraid to say it, but if we face the courtroom as we are now, the probability that our argument will be rejected in its entirety is extremely high."`
`"...So that other trial was a disaster.`
` ......And I was thinking their conditions were more favorable than ours.`
` That's tough.`
` Then, what about the good news?"`
`"I managed to get in contact with their executives.`
` I explained our situation to them,`
` explained that we have no intention of tarnishing their brand image, and I managed to get their understanding."`
`"They will offer us conditions in a few days, and if these are carried out, they promised to withdraw from the prosecution.`
` This comes straight from the number‐two man on their board of directors."`
`"Your impression?"`
`"Honestly, I expect the conditions will be extremely severe.`
` I would assume that changing the company name and the brand name will be inevitable.`
` Where we do have margin in the negotiations is the amount of settlement money, the appearance of a public apology in a major newspaper, and the amount of time needed to carry out those things."`
`"Why don't they just come straight out with it and tell us to go bankrupt."`
`"They changed to their second president only a couple of years ago, and the new president doesn't have a firm foothold on the position yet.`
` If we resist until the bitter end, they fear that the forces who want to go against the current president wouldn't hesitate to do some work in favor of the enemy."`
`"Hence, it seems the big shots over there want to settle this matter as fast as possible too.`
` Therefore, for the sake of a quick settlement, we may still have enough leeway to pull for some mitigation of the conditions."`
`"At any rate, an absurd amount of money will be necessary, I guess."`
`"You need to be prepared for that.`
` And even so, I believe it will be much cheaper than disciplinary compensation."`
`"Thank you very much.`
` If there's any more progress, please contact me.`
` You bill highly, so I can't even chat around idly with you.`
` Hahahaha.`
` <Thank you, thank you, goodbye>."`
`Rudolf hung up the phone.`
`It seemed that the executives sitting in the reception seats could guess what had been said.`
`"......You get all that, you reprobates?`
` Well, to sum up.`
` If we can just pay them off, they're gonna let it slide.`
` All we have to do now is turn our focus onto how much."`
`"But, President.`
` The sum that Mr. Watanabe estimated for the settlement is too much.`
` We don't have that much of a margin...!"`
`"If we'd have known this was going to happen, we never should have started diversifying..."`
`"The calculations were that we could escape the capital crisis if we were able to endure for three years.`
` ...To be stabbed at this juncture is just...incredibly unfortunate...!"`
`"I guess we tripped and fell at the "step" of the "hop, step, jump".`
` I could cry."`
`"We have no choice but to draw the money from the main bank."`
`"Banks are no good.`
` They only bet their money on winning horses.`
` ...The situation is getting better, but we can't show weakness to the banks."`
`"......President.`
` Do you have any funds which are unaccounted for?`
` Funds that we aren't aware of?"`
`"Stop that.`
` Do I look like that kind of man?`
` The contents of my wallet are all exposed to you guys, alright?`
` The account books over there show all that our company has."`
`"In that case, ......we need to raise money.`
` We need a sponsor, who can draw in several million dollars for us, as soon as possible."`
`"......President!`
` Couldn't something be worked out with one of your associates...?!"`
`"President!`
` President...!"`
`"...Aaaah, calm down, you bastards.`
` ......I'll find a way to raise the money.`
` You guys just maintain the business and try not to fall to pieces.`
` They're saying they'll forgive us so long as we hand over the money."`
`"We already have thick pipelines in Asia.`
` This'll probably have consequences all over the place, but we can still maintain our deals.`
` The point is, this is a problem that can be entirely resolved just by handing over money."`
`"Just watch, I'll settle everything.`
` I won't let you out in the cold.`
` Start feeling like you're in good hands!`
` When this is all over, I'll be rewarding all of you guys with a champagne tower.`
` I promise.`
` So, just shut up and follow me.`
` Alright?!!"`
`The airplane suddenly shook.`
` Probably because of turbulence.`
`That shaking roused Rudolf from his sleep.`
`{n}He had woken up early that morning, and had ended up drifting off to sleep while resting in his seat.`
`"...Are you alright?`
` You're still very drowsy, aren't you?`
` You've been so busy with work lately."`
`"It's a damned good thing I am busy with work.`
` If I suddenly find myself with nothing to do, we'll all be out in the cold starting the next day."`
`"You're right.`
` Battler‐kun's come back now, so I'm afraid we can't just go around begging if things get rough."`
`"......Yeah.`
` We've finally got our whole family back after six years.`
` ...The man of the house is gonna have to give his best so we can all spend some family time together..."`
`When he looked outside the window, he saw that the airplane was already starting to drop in altitude considerably.`
`The fishing boats, which had only looked like black grains until a short while ago, had become clearly visible.`
`".........If I could prostrate myself before Dad and borrow ten mil in exchange for a punch to the head, I'd take at least a dozen, but...`
` Failing that, he'd better hurry and give up the ghost."`
`" .........I've mooched off him so much over the years, and now I'm going for the inheritance.`
` ............I'm going to hell.`
` ...It won't surprise me a bit if he doesn't want to see me......"`
`"......Could it be that you don't plan on appearing at the family conference this year either?"`
`Nanjo looked at Kinzo's face, sighing.`
`{n}...Kinzo's eyes remained rooted to those strange magic books.`
`"I have no intention of joining those vultures in their discussion.`
` They can discuss how they will suck my bones as they wish.`
` ......They are not worth a moment of my time."`
`".....................`
` ...My, my.`
` How troublesome..."`
`Nanjo shook his head slightly.`
`...To him, children and grandchildren were to be adored.`
`{n}And he believed that their growth was the only enjoyment for old men.`
`He found Kinzo's words to be a very sad thing.`
`"If the time comes when I must leave this room, I will show myself then.`
` ......Just as that one does not show itself."`
`Kinzo raised his face, and in the direction of his gaze was the portrait of the witch, respectfully displayed on the wall...`
`".................."`
`Inside Kinzo's head, there was no conception of today being the day of the family conference, the day when all his dear family would gather together.`
`......There was only the face of the witch in the oil painting, who never smiled outside her portrait...`
`Everybody knew that when Kinzo talked about {f:5:Beatrice}, unnecessarily cutting in would instigate his wrath...`
`"Today, I will...perform a certain ritual."`
`"Hoh.`
` ...And what would that be?"`
`"......It would be more accurate to call it a gamble.`
` ...After all, no miracles dwell in magic without risk."`
`Nanjo had already heard this countless times.`
`{n}You could call it Kinzo's favorite phrase.`
`......It seemed that Kinzo believed in magic and miracles arising through betting his own fate with a certain kind of risky probability and beating the odds...`
`"Kinzo‐san, you may once have been called the Golden Gambler,`
` but I cannot imagine what kind of gamble you will take on with that aged body, when you could go to the other world at any time...`
` I guess this will be worth seeing..."`
`"Hmph...`
` ......I see.`
` So, if it were up to you, unversed in magic, even this secret ritual I have thoroughly researched would be branded as a gamble.`
` So be it."`
`"...............If it is I, a believer in miracles, who wins...`
`you will be able to understand clearly that all my research, which probably only appears as vagary in your eyes, did bear fruit on this day.`
` If you win,`
` ......it will all end as, just as you observed, nothing more than the vagary of an old man who could go to the other world at any time."`
`"Hoh...`
` I wonder what on Earth is this gamble you will start...`
` As your friend, I only pray that you come out from that bet—no, was it a ritual?`
` ...I only pray, from the bottom of my heart, that you can come out from that ritual victorious."`
`"Mmhm... ...I thank you."`
`"......Speaking of that, Kinzo‐san.`
` I hear that a long‐awaited guest will be present at the family conference this year?"`
`"What......?"`
`Kinzo reacted in a unusual way to Nanjo's words and turned around.`
`"You know, Battler‐kun from Rudolf‐san's family.`
` I hear he will be coming for the first time in six years.`
` I'm sure he has become a splendid boy."`
`"............Oh, Battler.`
` ...I wouldn't describe a guest who has been away a scant six years as "long‐awaited"."`
`Upon hearing Battler's name, he showed an ill‐humored expression, as though he had been let down, and turned his back to Nanjo again.`
`"I guess these six years went by in a blink of an eye to you, sunk in your research in this room..."`
`"Hmph.`
` ......Perhaps a truly long‐awaited guest...`
`......will pay us a visit.`
` .........Everything depends on the results of the roulette.`
` ...The roulette is already starting to revolve.`
` Rouge, or noir?"`
`"............Tonight, let us enjoy ourselves as we see what kind of miracle the roulette will show us.`
` ...The payoffs are large.`
` And I don't feel like losing...`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice}, ...you shall accept my bet........."`
`Just then, the telephone on the table rang.`
`That piercing noise seemed to displease Kinzo, and he picked up the receiver in order to preserve the silence as much as he could.`
`"......What is it?`
` I'm busy."`
`"It is Genji.`
` The family has arrived."`
`"And what does that have to do with me?`
` You can serve them some tea or something."`
`"...Certainly.`
` I will see to it."`
`Kinzo hung up the phone rudely.`
`Watching him, Nanjo sighed yet again, and shifted his attention outside the window.`
`As he was now, Kinzo would probably show no interest in any kind of guest.`
`...Was there any guest who could make Kinzo agree to come out when he should?`
`He had one person in mind, but that guest was one who could not possibly appear...`
`After a glance at the witch of the portrait, and her candid expression which he could not place as happy or sad, Nanjo gazed up at the leaden sky......`
`Now then, are the pieces all lined up......?`
`{n}Let us start a new game, with the pieces all lined up once more.`
`"Are there any problems...?"`
`"......Nope."`
`The witch looked at him in challenge while elegantly smoking her pipe.`
`And Battler?`
`{n}He just slovenly shrugged his shoulders as though she wasn't worth his time.`
`He wouldn't look her in the eyes.`
`{n}But that didn't mean he wasn't going to play.`
`...It signified his plain determination to never be taken in by the artifices of this being he faced.`
`{n}It was an expression of his powerful determination to fight.`
`"Don't tell me you don't have a plan...?"`
`"I don't know how you're going to play, so no, I don't have any plan.`
` ...Feel free to take the first move."`
`"Hmph... Naturally, I intend to.`
` In what way shall I destroy your defense?`
` In how many moves will I checkmate you?`
` ......That is how I will display my skills."`
`"............Whatever moves you come at me with, I will never believe in you!`
` ...As long as I stand my ground on that one point, I won't lose.`
` And what that means is this.`
` The way this game is made, you cannot win...!"`
`"Maybe you're right.`
` However...`
` I shall decide how many times we'll repeat this game.`
` It will be repeated over and over again, until I win and you admit defeat...!"`
`"In other words, this is torment.`
` Eternal torment that will continue until you surrender to me...!`
` Continuing eternally, until you acknowledge me and the existence of witches!"`
`"......In that case, I'll go along with you endlessly, any number of times, until you run out of patience.`
` I've never lost in such a "battle of wills"."`
`"Did some witch or other suggest that to you...?`
` *cackle*cackle*, that's just fine...!"`
`"I'm tired of listening to your rambling.`
` ...C'mon, get this started!"`
`"Come, let us begin!`
` I already know your moves far too well.`
` A defense doesn't amount to much if the plan behind it is known!`
` Don't think you'll be able to defy me with the same moves!!"`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I have only one thing to tell you before we start."`
`"What is it...?"`
`"You're free to say anything.`
` But when it comes to whether I believe or not,`
` that is always`
` for me`
` to decide...!"`
`"No matter how great your magic is!`
` My soul won't yield to you.`
` You think this will be torture for me?`
` You're wrong!!"`
`"Then, what would you call it...!"`
`"This is torture for you!!"`
`"Someday you will yield to me and give up!`
` Until then, you'll be tortured over and over again!"`
`"How amusing, a fine metaphor!!`
` Torture where we torment each other, how truly amusing!`
` Come, we shall begin that torture!!`
` Ushiromiya Battleeeeer!!!"`
`Every year, the relatives who visit Rokkenjima let out a sigh of admiration at the rose garden which first greets them...`
`They stood there talking with each other about the roses' beauty and the state of their blooming this year.`
`There was a single unhealthy rose among them, and Maria became overwhelmed with dejection at its state.`
`But George used his quick wits,`
` and saying she should look after it if she felt that sorry for it, he marked it with a candy wrapper, and immediately restored Maria's good mood.`
`And once Battler, with whom she had been getting along well all morning, raised the subject of Halloween that Maria loved so much, she began playing around energetically again.`
`To Maria,`
` those marshmallow jack‐o'‐lantern candies that her mother had bought for her were probably a treasure greater than any other.`
`...It seemed that several of them had been bought for her, and she demanded trick‐or‐treat from every person she met, giving them candy instead of the other way around.`
`"I wonder why Maria likes Halloween so much.`
` I thought that event was pretty difficult for Japanese people to get used to."`
`"Isn't that because it's a kid's festival where they get to parade around in costumes?`
` It's fun to play around in an outfit that's different than usual."`
`"No, ...I think there's probably a slightly deeper reason.`
` After all, she is Maria‐chan "the witch"."`
`"Come to think of it, when we were at the airport, didn't Maria say that if she was going to wear a costume, it would be a witch?`
` Does Maria like witches?"`
`"......Yes, she loves them.`
` So much that it becomes a problem."`
`"Well,`
` admiring fantastical stuff like that is to be expected at that age."`
`"If she'd at least chosen a heroine of some TV anime to admire, that would've been cute...`
` ...haah."`
`Judging by Rosa's reactions, it seemed that, as a mother, she did not find her daughter's love for witches pleasant.`
`Seemingly all the cousins other than Battler were able to understand this, and they shrugged their shoulders, smiling awkwardly.`
`"Hmmmm?`
` So if you like witches, you also like Halloween, is that how it works?"`
`"I guess I should just ask her myself if I don't know.`
` Hey, Maria.`
` What kind of relationship do Halloween and witches have with each other?"`
`As Battler asked that, George and Jessica let out a small "ah—" noise.`
`...It seemed they were too late.`
`It almost looked as though Maria had been waiting for that question.`
`After looking happy for an instant, her expression turned a little mean, as if to say "You don't know anything, do you?"`
`It was the expression of an enthusiast who has been enraged by the ignorant statement of an outsider with a wrong impression.`
`"Uu.`
` ...The Celts thought of the changing strength of the sun over the course of a year...`
`as its birth, its growing‐up period, its aging and death, and then its revival."`
`"I get it.`
` The sun, weak and warm in spring, starts to grow up and become hot,`
` and then it gradually gets weaker and worn out... Yeah, I can see how you could think of that as the passing of the sun's life."`
`"Yep.`
` So they thought that at the end of October, the sun died, rested its body in the land of the dead, and then revived again at the winter solstice.`
` And so, they celebrated the day that the sun ends its one‐year lifespan and dies, calling it New Year's Eve, or Samhain."`
`"That way of thinking is very interesting, to say that the sun is "revived" on the day of the winter solstice, when the daylight hours start to grow longer again.`
` It's an episode that makes you understand how much ancient people deified the sun."`
`"...I seeee.`
` And? What do witches have to do with this?"`
`It seemed that my casual urging forward had slightly infuriated Maria.`
`She glared at me with eyes that told me to let her explain without interrupting.`
`......Maria looked like she was having fun telling me, so I decided not to interrupt...`
`"In the interval between October and November, life and death become the closest they ever will.`
` ...The Celts believed that this was the time when the world of the living was at its closest to that of the dead and those not of this world,`
` and when they would be visited by many inhabitants of the other world."`
`"......It was like the Bon festival in Japan.`
` Kihihihihi."`
`At the time, the people believed that the souls returning to the physical world would go into people's houses or possess people to do bad things.`
`So in order to avoid harm from them, the people invented protective rituals.`
`One of those was to imitate creepy monsters and scare the souls instead, which was apparently a way to avoid being possessed.`
`"So that part became a festival, which turned into a costume parade.`
` ...Maria's really knowledgeable!"`
`"......Ain't it the truth.`
` Even I never knew Halloween had such a history."`
`"But where did the whole "trick or treat" thing come from?"`
`Her knowledge was so extensive that the adults had started listening in too at some point.`
` Maria, who was normally always treated like the youngest, puffed out her chest in pride.`
`Rosa tried to say this was just a kid's story, and that she wanted to quickly break up the circle and set the luggage down in the guesthouse,`
` but nobody else agreed, and she let out a heavy sigh.`
`"Uu.`
` Trick or treat is just for fun.`
` It has nothing to do with what was originally a Celtic ceremony.`
` That was created later when Christian customs were mixed in.`
` ...But I think that Halloween should be that way."`
`According to Maria, the souls of the dead weren't the only ones who visited from the world of the nonhuman;`
` there were also spirits that had an intimate connection to how people lived.`
`It was because humans received the favors of those spirits that they were able to earn a wonderful blessing,`
` and a year's worth of good crops.`
`"So in other words, Halloween was also a bit of a harvest festival?"`
`"I see.`
` ...Now you mention it, I get the feeling that October is a turning point in various ways, seasonally too.`
` I mean, it's exactly on the other side of the year to Japan's April.`
` ......Yeah, that might be a good place to mark it."`
`"Uu!`
` And you know, the witches, they held a coven during that time, called a Sabbat.`
` The witches would thank the spirits that gave out blessings of prosperity, and reward them."`
`"Halloween costumes are an imitation of the visitors from the other side.`
` ......So, then, the reason we give candy to them must be because of a feeling that they should be thanked for the yearly harvest."`
`"Uu!`
` Just like George onii‐chan says!"`
`"So Halloween is a time when this world and that world intermingle?`
` So, in other words, it's a precious opportunity for witches to interact with visitors from that world.`
` Is that what you want to say?"`
`"Uu!!`
` Just like Battler says!"`
`"So you know what?`
` You know what?!`
` October is the time when the power of witches and demons is at its most vigorous and prosperous!`
` Kihihihihihihihi, I'm sure {f:5:Beatrice} will come too!"`
`"And then, we'll eat the marshmallow candies together, and she'll take me to the Golden Land with her!`
` We'll sing magical songs together, learn magic spells together, learn how to draw magic circles together!`
` And then I'm going to learn the secrets of runes, and become a great witch really, really quickly!"`
`"My, my, isn't that wonderful.`
` It's best for kids to have dreams.`
` By the way, Rosa,`
` how old did Maria‐chan turn this year again...?"`
`"Ma‐...Maria...`
` That's enough of that topic!"`
`"Don't worry about it, Rosa‐san.`
` It's a dream that any girl has at one time or another."`
`"Tha‐thank you very much.`
` ...But Maria has already outgrown that age.`
` ...Hey, I'm telling you to stop!"`
`Rosa scolded Maria, trying to shut her up before her cheery discussion about black magic earned her the snickers of the relatives.`
`"Wow...`
` That's a pretty large‐scale dream.`
` ......By the way, who was {f:5:Beatrice} again?`
` ......What was it, umm, umm, I've heard that before..."`
`Battler had been gone for six years, and had completely forgotten about the legend of the Rokkenjima witch.`
`However, when he said that he didn't know {f:5:Beatrice}'s name, Maria's mood, which had been so bright until just now, became sour in an instant.`
`When he saw that, Battler immediately remembered that it was the name of the witch of this island, but the damage had been done.`
`...Until Maria's mood improved, many mysterious and fabulous episodes regarding the Golden Witch were drilled into his brain...`
`"That is enough, Maria.`
` Thank you, Battler‐kun, for going along with her stories."`
`"...Kanon‐kun, don't you have work to do?`
` Please leave now.`
` Gohda‐san, I think everyone wants to set down their bags for the time being.`
` Sorry, but could you guide everyone to the guesthouse?"`
`"Certainly.`
` ...Well then, everyone, I will guide you to the guesthouse."`
`"......Then if you will excuse me."`
`Led by Gohda, the relatives headed off in the direction of the guesthouse.`
`Their minds on setting down their luggage and taking a quick rest, they didn't notice that Rosa and Maria had stayed in the same spot.`
`After watching them leave towards the guesthouse, Rosa's features changed suddenly.`
`She let go with the hand that had been gripping Maria's arm the whole time.`
`...There was a bright red mark there, making it clear how much excessive force she had been gripping Maria's slender arm with.`
`That hand then smacked Maria over the head, and pulled her left ear up into the air, pinching it sharply...`
`"I'm always telling you not to talk about witches......`
` ...Haven't I always said that was our promise together......?"`
`"Mama, it hurts, Mama, it hurts... It hurts it hurts it hurts......"`
`"Halloween, Halloween, do you ever stop...?`
` A witch festival...?`
` Who cares about the Celts, who cares about black magic, are you an {i:idiot}......?`
` You are nine years old, nine..."`
`"Because you made that ruckus in the train, I had to go to all the trouble of getting off and buying you those disgusting monster marshmallows that look they have fluorescent paint on them...`
` We were even late because I bought them for you.`
` How much more will you have to embarrass me before you're satisfied......?!"`
`As Rosa cursed, she twisted Maria's ear up, making it seem like it was going to snap off...`
`An expression of anguish spread across Maria's face, and she stood on her tiptoes as though her life depended on it, trying to soften the pain on the ear that was being pulled...`
`Rosa suddenly stole the candy that Maria had been holding in her hand.`
`Then she threw it on the ground and stepped on it over and over.`
`To Maria, it was supposed to be proof of her memory of that span of time, however brief, when she had enjoyed going shopping with her mother...`
`But it was being trampled by that very same mother.`
`{n}...It was as though a brand was being pushed against Maria's eyes, leaving a mark that couldn't be erased...`
`"Who cares about this disgusting candy,`
` disgusting, disgusting...!!"`
`"This is {i:why}, you see?! {i:This} is why!!`
` Disgusting disgusting disgusting!!!"`
`She struck Maria's head over and over again with her palm as she spoke.`
`{n}...She didn't hit Maria's face. Because the red swelling would stand out.`
`Maria closed her eyes tightly, patiently bearing her mother's violence...`
` ...No, that wasn't quite it.`
`".......Come back, Mama, come back, Mama...`
` Save me, Mama, save me, Mama...`
` Beat the bad witch......"`
`She kept bearing it, muttering that over and over...`
`"Will you LISTEN!!`
` I TOLD you...`
`to STOP...`
`saying...`
`witch!!`
` You little...`
` You... You...!!!"`
`Rosa's shoulders shook as she breathed, tired from hitting.`
`...Maria grasped her hands together, withstanding it, hoping her "mother" would come back quickly...`
`"......Mama, Mama...`
` Come back quickly...`
` Save me, Mama......`
` Finish off the bad witch......"`
`"Why don't you, ...why don't you just stay there doing that forever!!`
` And then you can just stand there, mumbling about witches and Halloween forever!!"`
`After throwing those words at Maria, Rosa went off towards the guesthouse, leaving Maria behind.`
`...Maria, unable even to remember that it was alright to cry,`
` kept staring down at the trampled, unrecognizable jack‐o'‐lantern candy...`
`"Oh, Rosa.`
` Where did you go?"`
`"I'm sorry.`
` The roses were so wonderful, I got a bit carried away."`
`"Rosa, go set your luggage down, quickly.`
` We're going to greet Aniki."`
`"Hmm?`
` What happened to Maria‐chan?`
` Is she still by the flower beds?"`
`"...Yes.`
` It looks like there was a rose she liked, and she said she wanted to look after it and wouldn't listen.`
` I decided to let her do what she wants for a while."`
`"............We sometimes forget that girls have their own little world.`
` Sometimes, we have to respect that, right?"`
`"......That's right.`
` ...Thank you for caring, Kyrie nee‐san."`
`"...Gohda‐san.`
` Where is our room?"`
`"I will guide you. This way.`
` Allow me to hold your luggage."`
`"I'm fine, I can carry it myself. Thank you."`
`Rosa went into the room that Gohda had guided her to.`
`Closing the door somewhat violently, she threw her luggage on top of the bed.`
`".................................`
` ............"`
`She got down on her knees in front of the bed, ......and buried her face in it.`
`For a while, Rosa made as if to shred the sheets with her fingernails, sobbing continually...`
`".........Maria‐sama.`
` ...Are you alright?"`
`Kanon, who had been hiding behind a thicket, appeared after watching Rosa leave.`
`"...Kihi......kihihihihihihihihihi...`
` ...I'm fine.`
` ...Kihihihihi."`
`Maria laughed unpleasantly, but to Kanon, who had seen the whole thing, it looked like she was enduring as best she could...`
`"She's a horrible person.`
` I can't believe that was a mother......"`
`"......It can't be helped.`
` Such pitiful things enter such pitiful vessels.`
` ...I am just fine.`
` Kihihihihihihihihihi......"`
`Kanon got down on his knees and picked up the trampled candy.`
`......It was tragic just looking at it.`
`He thought about dusting it off and returning it to her, but really couldn't do so with it in that condition.`
`As he was at a loss at what to do, he met eyes with Maria.`
`{n}......No, they didn't meet.`
`{n}Maria was looking at the candy that Kanon had picked up.`
`...Right now, Maria's heart was surely the same as that trampled candy which had been crushed into a pulp...`
`Kanon realized this, but he didn't know what he should do...`
`"...I know...`
` ......I'll exchange it for the one I received earlier."`
`Kanon remembered that an identical candy which he had received from Maria was in his pocket.`
`Maria stuck out her hand.`
`......Kanon thought she was trying to accept it, so he held out the candy, but Maria didn't try to grasp it.`
`......Then Kanon realized.`
` ...She was asking him to give it back.`
`......No matter how tragic it was, the trampled candy was Maria's.`
`...Her mother had bought it for her.`
`No matter how tragic, it had to be this candy...`
`{n}If only it could be made pretty again by dusting it off...`
`...Kanon hung his head.`
`".........I can't do anything except dust it off.`
` .........Sorry."`
`Kanon held out the miserable candy she wanted.`
`{n}Maria took it, and spoke.`
`"...Thank you.`
` A {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} can't do anything except dust it off, but a witch can repair it to how it was.`
` It would be easy for {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Kihihihihihi."`
`"............Maria‐sama,`
` ...do you...`
`know about {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama?"`
`There couldn't be anyone related to the Ushiromiya family who didn't know {f:5:Beatrice}'s name, with Battler as an exception.`
`...But just now, Maria had told Battler about her proudly.`
`{n}She had spoken almost as though she had been meeting with {f:5:Beatrice} regularly.`
`The inside of the fist Kanon made with his left hand hurt sharply.`
`{n}......In the past, a witch called {f:5:Beatrice} had appeared, and had tempted him and Shannon.`
`He had always tried to make himself think it had been a bad dream.`
` ......However, Shannon insisted that it had definitely been a real witch.`
`And then, this summer.`
`......The shrine to the local Shinto god had been hit by lightning and had disappeared without a trace in the span of a single night.`
`...He had known that Shannon had broken the mirror.`
`{n}......And he remembered too that upon the witch's departure, she had left him with the words that she would eventually be revived.`
`And now, .........this girl who had no end of faith in {f:5:Beatrice} spoke as though she had met her.`
`...Kanon couldn't suppress a sense of something ominous welling up in his heart.`
`For a while, Maria remained silent, as though she could see into Kanon's heart.`
`...As though she was waiting for his memory of {f:5:Beatrice} to come back to him.`
`Then, she spoke matter‐of‐factly.`
`"Kihihihihi...`
` You know, I am friends with {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I'm meeting her today too, to play.`
` Kihihihihihihihihi..."`
`"Pla‐...play?"`
`"...Yep.`
` Play.`
` We're going to study magic together.`
` Kihihihihihihihi..."`
`......The face of the witch, who Kanon had tried to pretend was a bad dream,`
` ......began to slowly creep into the back of his mind......`
`"Father said he was extremely busy with his research.`
` He said that, unfortunately, he will be unable to make an appearance."`
`"......Come on.`
` We've put this conference in our schedules and come all the way out to Rokkenjima during the very busy fall season.`
` I wish Dad would act a little more sociable."`
`"So true.`
` ......Doctor Nanjo.`
` Is it really a problem with his research and his mood?`
` He isn't already bedridden, and unable to get up, right?"`
`"......Well, ......I wonder.`
` There is not much I can say..."`
`Nanjo glanced at Natsuhi.`
`{n}As though he wasn't qualified to disregard Natsuhi when he spoke on this topic.`
`"Father is healthier than ever.`
` Calling him bedridden is the height of rudeness...!"`
`"But he only has three months left to live, right?`
` Normally, wouldn't that mean that he'd be wasting away, unable to get out of his bed?`
` Right, Doctor Nanjo?"`
`".........For a normal patient, that would probably be the case.`
` But Kinzo‐san has extraordinary willpower.`
` ...The force of his will may have even the Grim Reaper too terrified to approach..."`
`"If he's that energetic, then we can be at least a little reassured, right?"`
`"...Although if he's that energetic, I wish he'd at least allow us to greet him.`
` ...Isn't the point of the family conference to come and see Dad's face?`
` Now I don't know why the hell we came."`
`"Don't say that.`
` If he were here, you would complain the whole time about how you couldn't relax.`
` I say we should celebrate that all of us siblings are here together as a family again this year, as we were the last, without even one of us missing."`
`"You realize we couldn't meet him at last year's family conference either?`
` I wonder why we can't get him to understand that his children by blood want to see him after two years."`
`"......If you have words of greeting for him, I will tell him for you.`
` Or, Eva‐san,`
` ......perhaps you had something other than a greeting you wanted to discuss with Father...?"`
`"..................nn.`
` ...Come on, what are you talking about, sheesh."`
`"Give it a rest, Eva.`
` Natsuhi‐san, forgive us.`
` Eva's just concerned about Father's condition, as his daughter.`
` Please understand her feelings a bit."`
`"That's right.`
` Eva, how suddenly you've become respectful to Father since he was told how long he has left.`
` ...Yes, I can just about understand why you might be desperate to see him.`
` ......Hmph."`
`".........What exactly are you implying?"`
`"Quit it, Aneki.`
` Why don't we pray that his mood will improve by dinner?`
` ...And we've just arrived.`
` And anyway, we only came to give a light greeting.`
` We can hold the family conference even without Dad."`
`"...No, there should even be a few things that we can't talk to him about until we form a unified opinion.`
` Right, Hideyoshi nii‐san?"`
`"Yep!`
` Just as Rudolf‐kun says.`
` ......We can only gather our faces here once a year.`
` We've gotta value this precious time we've got, and talk together frankly."`
`Even though the tea hadn't even come yet, ...they were very strong‐minded.`
`"But before that, I wonder if we have enough leeway to enjoy some black tea at our leisure,`
` surrounded by the wonderful furnishings of the mansion's parlor..."`
`Kyrie's words seemed to hold some slight admonishment towards all of the people gathered in that place.`
`They all understood, and as they cleared their throats and straightened their neckties, the atmosphere in the room returned to normal for a moment.`
`"......Excuse me.`
` I have brought some tea."`
`"Hey, Shannon‐chan.`
` You just keep gettin' prettier and prettier!"`
`Shannon entered the parlor, pushing the serving cart.`
`Everyone decided to slowly enjoy some black tea for the time being...`
`A wonderful aroma began to spread throughout the parlor.`
`Looking at that scene, it would have been impossible to guess the strained atmosphere which had been there until right before Shannon had entered.`
`...Of course, Shannon, who was setting out the tea, probably didn't even notice.`
`......Kyrie made a gesture that seemed to laugh at everyone's adult appearance.`
`Rudolf didn't like it when Kyrie took the initiative and spoke at the family conference.`
`...It was his worthless male pride.`
`He probably didn't want to look like a weak man taking his wife's advice.`
`She understood that, and was doing her best to refrain from saying anything unnecessary.`
`So she separated herself from the circle of siblings, which was good‐natured only in appearance, and slowly enjoyed her tea near the window.`
`"Oh, Rosa‐san.`
` I thought all you siblings were having a friendly discussion together...?"`
`"......You are joking."`
`"Sorry, don't take it the wrong way.`
` I'm just rolling my eyes at my husband."`
`It seemed that Rosa hadn't been able to keep up the charade of amicability.`
`...They had come here to fight bloodily and dirtily, each trying to steal the inheritance from the others.`
`She probably didn't want to pretend to be fellow conspirators at this stage.`
`......Or maybe she was still much too inexperienced for that.`
`"...It looks like the wind has started blowing hard out there.`
` ...The plants are all shaking so much."`
`"The typhoon has probably already come fairly close.`
` ......I wonder if it will rain a lot tonight."`
`"...............Maria‐chan really has grown a lot this past year."`
`".........Does it look that way...?`
` She still can't even fold her own clothing yet."`
`"Yes.`
` It's because she has such an affectionate mother.`
` She'll grow into a girl who's rich in heart."`
`Rosa was silent.`
`{n}.........Maybe she was unsure as to how Kyrie meant that...`
`"...Me...?`
` .........I'm not fit to be a mother.`
` ...............Children can't choose their parents.`
` That poor girl..."`
`"Doesn't that go both ways?`
` ......A parent can't choose what kind of child is born, either."`
`".............................."`
`Rosa bit her lower lip...`
`"It isn't a matter of who's at fault.`
` You just need to have the mindset of going through life together with her, and slowly watch over her as she grows up."`
`"Rosa‐san, you spend every day with Maria‐chan, so you probably don't notice the gradual changes.`
` But the rest of us, who have been reunited with her after a year, really understand that she's grown up a lot..."`
`"......If you mean that sincerely, then thank you very much."`
`"Then, if you will excuse me.`
` If there is anything you desire, please call for it at any time."`
`Shannon bowed politely and left the room.`
`After Hideyoshi and Rudolf watched her go with turned heads,`
` ...the atmosphere in the room began to revert back to what it had been right before Shannon had visited.`
`".........If Father is unable to be here, that in itself opens up the opportunity for some certain topics.`
` Right, Rudolf?"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` ...We didn't come all the way out here just to drink some dusty tea, you know."`
`"......Very well.`
` Why don't we hear this topic that you're scrambling to get to?"`
`".........My, my.`
` Those people sure are strong‐minded.`
` They really started fast."`
`"I must join in as well.`
` ......If I don't assert myself, they'll quickly forget that there are four of us siblings."`
`"...It can't be easy for you, either.`
` ......Maybe I didn't choose my words well.`
` I'm sorry."`
`"No, I don't mind.`
` ...I'm the one who should be apologizing.`
` We're both mothers with daughters, so really, we should have more of these conversations.`
` But every time we meet, we talk about something strange..."`
`"......That's the fault of the atmosphere in this mansion.`
` Once we breathe in this air, everyone gets so strained.`
` ......Just once, I want to drink a nice, long cup of tea with you, Rosa‐san, when we aren't attending a family conference.`
` There's a wonderful coffee shop in Ginza which is a favorite of mine.`
` Please let me invite you sometime soon."`
`"Thank you, Kyrie‐san.`
` That sounds good..."`
`"How horrible.`
` The sky's suddenly gotten dark.`
` It's almost as though the people in this room have made the weather worse.`
` ......There's already thunder."`
`"Oh?`
` Do I see the first signs of rain...?"`
`"...Huh?"`
`There really were small splashes of rain on the glass of the parlor window.`
`{n}...It seemed that the weather had gotten worse faster than they had expected.`
`......Just then, a silent thunderbolt struck inside Rosa's head, and she remembered that her beloved child was in the rose garden.`
`A normal girl would think about going into the house if the weather got bad.`
`{n}......But Maria was different.`
` She would sometimes become stubborn, and wouldn't move no matter whether rain or even spears fell from the sky.`
`......That's right, I...`
`......told that kid "{i:just stay there doing that forever}", didn't I...?`
`"Oh, ......oh no...!`
` Maria...!!"`
`At this small exclamation, everyone turned to look at Rosa.`
`"...What, what happened?"`
`"I, I'm sorry, I'm going outside for a second.`
` I'll be right back!"`
`"......What what what? What's going on with her, seriously..."`
`"Does it matter? She'll be right back.`
` ......Why don't we just get started?`
` With our main topic."`
`"Good idea.`
` We can move that on even without Rosa.`
` Let's return to the matter at hand."`
`".................."`
`Rosa dashed from the entrance hall into the rose garden.`
`When she opened the door, the wind that hit her was too strong to be called a breeze, and told her that the typhoon was approaching faster than she had thought.`
`Just as Kyrie had said, small droplets of rain were mixed in with the wind.`
` There was also the low rumble of thunder.`
`......It could start raining anytime.`
`Rosa headed for the rose garden.`
`{n}She headed for the place where she had scolded Maria a short while ago.`
`...It was almost lunchtime.`
`The children had been told that they could just come to the mansion at lunchtime,`
` so they were probably in the guesthouse, waiting to be called.`
`...Even if Maria didn't come, they would surely think that I had taken her to the mansion with me, and wouldn't worry much.`
`......After all, she was with her mother, so there shouldn't have been anything to worry about.`
`Except I was here, and had thrown my daughter into the worsening weather outside, all alone...!`
`"Mariaaa!!`
` Are you here?!!`
` If you're here, answer me!!"`
`".........Uu."`
`It really was as I'd thought.`
`She was standing stock still, ...exactly the same way she had been, in the place where I had scolded her.`
`Held in her hand......was the candy that I had bought, given her, and then stepped on and crushed.`
`With that gripped in her hand, she had been standing there, as the strong wind whipped her hair about, tormenting her...`
`"I'm sorry, I'm sorry!!`
` Sorry, Maria...!!`
` Forgive Mama...!"`
`"...Uu.`
` Mama, welcome back...`
` ......I waited a long time for you to come back, Mama.`
` ...Got pinched by the scary witch, but held out and waited for Mama to come back, without crying..."`
`"......Maria...`
` ......Forgive Mama... Forgive Mama......"`
`"It's not your fault, Mama...`
` You were just possessed by a bad witch again......`
` So I'm fine.`
` Love you, Mama.`
` I love you......"`
`"UuuuuuUUuuuUUUuughhh!!`
` I'm sorry, I'm sorry...`
` ......Mama......lost to the bad witch...`
` .........Forgive me............"`
`Rosa buried her face in Maria's small chest, crying and begging forgiveness.`
`...And those tears dripped down again, as they had countless times before.`
`If only the brilliant sun had been shining on the two of them,`
` all of their cares would have evaporated, and they would have felt like they could begin anew.`
`...However, what surrounded the two of them was the worsening weather.`
`{n}The strong winds mixed in with the sound of thunder were saddening.`
`Rosa noticed the sound of Maria sniffling.`
`{n}...If she stood exposed to the wind for too long, she would probably catch a cold.`
`"......So, Maria.`
` It will be lunch very soon.`
` Come back to the mansion with Mama."`
`"Uu.`
` I'm not coming."`
`"Wh‐...why...?"`
`Rosa thought that Maria had already forgiven her, so she never imagined she would refuse.`
`But that expression on Maria's face didn't look like that of a child resisting her mother.`
` ...So Rosa wasn't able to understand why Maria wanted to stand still in the rose garden, pointlessly, as the weather grew even worse.`
`Maria answered that question...`
`"It's {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` She'll come really soon.`
` So I'm waiting."`
`".........Maria..."`
`Rosa started to say something, faltered, and then fell silent.`
`...They had just gone to great lengths to make up with each other.`
`{n}She chose her words carefully, trying to get Maria to come with her to the mansion without denying the witch outright.`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice} is...`
`coming?"`
`"Uu!"`
`"Really...`
` Then instead of waiting here, why don't we wait in the mansion?`
` If you stay in this wind too long, you'll catch a cold..."`
`"She'll come!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} will come!!!"`
`"And when she does, I'll give a candy to her.`
` I'll do trick‐or‐treat!`
` I'll give her a jack‐o'‐lantern marshmallow candy and say Happy Halloween!!!`
` Uu!!"`
`Maria pulled yet another sweet out of her handbag, moaning "uu‐uu".`
`Rosa was bewildered, not knowing what to do as Maria started being difficult again...`
`Just then, there was a sudden and massive roar of thunder.`
`It was probably...a sign.`
` ......A sign that indicated this island had become closed off by the storm, and detached from common sense and reality.`
`Therefore, as of this moment, all common sense would no doubt be useless.`
`The wind blew even stronger, and in the middle of a blizzard of scattered rose petals,`
` ......a figure appeared, leaving Rosa momentarily unable to imagine that this was a scene from reality.`
`...No, probably, it was―it had to be―fantastical.`
`Because that figure was shaped like...............`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}!!"`
`Maria dashed over to the figure.`
`......Normally, Rosa would scold her daughter if she dashed over to a complete stranger.`
`...But Rosa forgot about that, unable to do anything but stand there, shocked.`
`"......It's been a while.`
` Have you been in good health?"`
`"Uu!`
` I'm in good health!`
` Witches don't catch colds!`
` Uu!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Witches make people catch colds with curses, but how foolish would it be if they caught one themselves.`
` You should focus your energies on ensuring that you do not catch a cold yourself."`
`She patted Maria's head as she said this, smiling roguishly...`
`Rosa couldn't have known the name of the woman who was happily spoiling Maria.`
` ...However, Maria had called to her in the beginning when she had appeared.`
`Therefore, even though Rosa had never met her, and even though she hadn't named herself, Rosa was able to learn her name.`
`......However, that name held a special meaning on Rokkenjima and in the Ushiromiya family.`
`......There's no way something so stupid could......!`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}!`
` Happy Halloween!`
` Look, bought these!`
` You can have one too.`
` Uu!"`
`"Mm, Happy Halloween.`
` Hoh, for me, you say?`
` Even the single and only light given to a man lost in the darkness of purgatory, unable to go to heaven or hell, looks truly charming when made into a candy like this."`
`"......Right now, on this island that has been cut off both from the world of humans and the world of nonhumans,`
` there may be no sweet more suitable.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`".........Hm?`
` Maria, what has happened here?"`
`The witch noticed the sweet that Maria was grasping.`
` ...It was Maria's candy, which had been stomped on by Rosa, and had taken on a pitiful shape.`
`"......Uu.`
` Stepped on and smashed.`
` ......Can you return it to normal, Beato...?"`
`Maria deliberately didn't say that it was her mother who had stepped on it.`
`{n}However, when the witch saw the candy, for some reason, she looked at Rosa and grinned.`
`...A chill went down Rosa's spine, as though she felt that this gaze could see through every part of her.`
`"It will be easy.`
` Give it to me."`
`"Uu!"`
`Maria held out the candy gleefully.`
`......Rosa could do nothing but watch this unfold, stunned.`
`{n}...How could this person gloss over the fact that the candy was pitifully trampled, in a way that could satisfy Maria...?`
`Maria looked as though she believed that it could be fixed as good as new.`
`...There was no way that could be done without real "magic"...!`
`"My, my, it is quite crushed, isn't it.`
` ......Come, Maria.`
` Close your eyes and try to remember."`
`"Because it really was that wonderful a candy.`
` The candies in our memories are always full and fluffy.`
` So you too must close your eyes and try to remember.`
` What kind of candy was it really{p:0:♪}"`
`...Along with those strange words, spoken as though singing an improvised folk song, the witch threw the sweet into the air.`
`Maria had her eyes closed, just as the witch had told her, and was focused on remembering.`
`{n}...The shape that the crushed candy had really been.`
`Therefore, only Rosa saw that scene.`
`The sweet which had been thrown into the air......burst into a gold color―no,`
` those were golden butterflies.`
`It scattered into several golden butterflies, ...and they began to assemble in the witch's hand, held up to the sky.`
`And when they had, .........unbelievably, .........the candy had returned to its beautiful original form, just like the time it had been bought...`
`Only Rosa and the witch had watched that scene.`
`Unable to understand the event that was occurring right in front of her eyes, Rosa stood with her mouth open, forgetting to shut it...`
`"You may now open your eyes.`
` ...Take it.`
` Now your sweet has returned to normal."`
`"Uu!!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}, you're always awesome awesome, *giggle*!!"`
`"................................."`
`There was a very bold contrast between Rosa's shocked appearance and Maria's innocently joyful one.`
`......Was that what the witch was laughing at?`
`{n}A smile floated to {f:5:Beatrice}'s face, different from the one that she had shown Maria.`
`"......Does my face look familiar?`
` If you stare so fixedly, you might burn a hole through it."`
`"Huh, ......ah, I, I'm sorry...!"`
`At those words, it hit Rosa strongly.`
`......Rosa knew her face.`
`{n}......She knew it from the portrait of the witch.`
`But, no, wait, ......was this mystery woman really......?!`
`"......Maria.`
` I will give this to you in exchange for that sweet."`
`"Uu...?`
` Letter?"`
`The witch pulled a Western envelope from her pocket and gave it to Maria.`
` However, when Maria made to open it, the witch stopped her.`
`"You must not.`
` The time will come soon to open it, but until then, you must not open it under any circumstances.`
` Take good care of it.`
` It will become an invitation calling you to the Golden Land."`
`"The Golden Land!!`
` You're finally going to take me there!!`
` *giggle*!`
` *giggle*!!"`
`"Take it and tuck it away safely.`
` You must not show it to anyone."`
`"Uu!`
` Promise!`
` I always keep my promises with witches!"`
`"......And this is for you."`
`"huh.........?`
` M‐......me......?!"`
`She probably hadn't imagined that the witch would speak to her, too.`
`Rosa was bewildered by this second Western envelope which had been thrust before her.`
`She remembered having seen that Western envelope before.`
`......There could be no mistake.`
` It was Kinzo's special envelope, used when he wrote with his own hand, and bearing the Ushiromiya crest.`
`Moreover, it was sealed with red sealing wax,`
` ...and further still, it had an imprint which seemed to have been made by the Head's Ring.`
`In other words, irrespective of what was written inside,`
` ...this woman, who Maria called {f:5:Beatrice},`
` was trusted enough that she was in charge of a personal letter from the current Ushiromiya head...!`
`"It could have been any of the four siblings.`
` However, the fact that I have met you here probably means that you were chosen by Kinzo's roulette."`
`"...So take it.`
` And read its contents aloud while seated at the dinner table, when all of the siblings are gathered."`
`".........What did you say......"`
`Rosa looked back and forth several times between the witch's face and the envelope she had been handed.`
`Today was the family conference, and the biggest object of discussion was the inheritance problem.`
` ......So, she had joined together with Eva and Rudolf,`
` and they had planned to force certain conditions upon Krauss to try to extort a prompt payment of several hundred million yen out of him.`
`It was as if the witch could see through all of that.`
`{n}......And when all of the siblings are gathered, ....what is she planning on announcing to us?`
`With a personal envelope that no one but the Ushiromiya head can use...!`
`"......Maria,`
` the weather is getting worse.`
` Return to the guesthouse and wait for lunchtime."`
`".........Well then, Rosa, let us meet later.`
` Allow me to name myself there.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`The witch turned her back to her, laughing.`
`{n}...And headed off towards the mansion with an air of composure.`
`Maria saw her off with an energetic reply, and then dashed off towards the guesthouse, leaving Rosa where she was.`
`......As though she didn't want to waste a second in informing the other cousins of her good fortune at meeting the witch.`
`Ultimately, Rosa was left alone in the rose garden as the winds grew stronger,`
` ......unable to do anything except pray that what had happened was just a daydream...`
`When the witch entered the entrance hall, ......Genji was there.`
`{n}With a respectful bow, Genji welcomed the "guest" who approached from the entrance hall...`
`"We have been awaiting you.`
` .........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"...It's been a while, Genji.`
` .........Hmph.`
` You've gotten old."`
`"......No matter how old it is, furniture will only carry out its work like furniture, until the end."`
`".........I remember how his wife used to be jealous of you.`
` ...Is Kinzo well?"`
`"He is full of life."`
`"......Hmph.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The witch's laugh was probably because she knew that Kinzo's own doctor had told him that he would not live much longer.`
`...However, if anyone actually looked at Kinzo,`
` his energy and vigor, which made it extremely difficult to imagine that his remaining life really was slim, might make it natural to call him "full of life".`
`...Maybe the witch had laughed at that.`
`"Then let us greet him.`
` It will be good to hurl curses at each other after thirty years."`
`As the witch grinned, she started walking, leaving Genji behind.`
`{n}......Her gait was like that of a family member who knew the inside of the mansion well.`
`Genji followed her, as though he served her.`
`At that very moment, Kyrie came out of the parlor.`
`{n}...She had probably come out to fix her makeup or something.`
`And when she saw Genji following the witch, she was surprised, although her expression did not change.`
`There was a visitor for Kinzo, whose remaining life was not long, on the day of the family conference when the fate of the inheritance was to be decided,`
` ...and furthermore, this person was well enough acquainted with the Ushiromiya family that Genji was following behind her.`
`......Kyrie immediately realized that this person who she had never met before was someone deeply important.`
`Kyrie met eyes with the witch.`
`{n}......Realizing that it would be rude to pretend not to notice, she greeted the witch.`
`"............Pleased to meet you."`
`"Rudolf's second wife?"`
`"That is correct.`
` This is Kyrie‐sama, Rudolf‐sama's current wife."`
`From this exchange, Kyrie realized that this woman was a guest of considerably high rank within the Ushiromiya family.`
`.........And, the fact she was a guest of that level,`
` ......coupled with the face of the entrance hall portrait behind her, ......made Kyrie's eyes open wide in an instant...`
`"......Pleased to meet you.`
` My name is Kyrie.`
` I wonder if this is our first meeting.`
` If we did greet each other before, I apologize for forgetting your name."`
`"...You already have a vague idea, yet you expect me to waste my breath?"`
`"..........................."`
`Kyrie had thought she had given her a sociable and humble greeting.`
`{n}Her expression grew slightly cloudy at that openly oppressive response.`
`......It didn't seem like this was a person she could grow to like.`
`...But if Kyrie's imagination was correct, ......this "witch" likely held a huge key to what her own husband was most interested in,`
` and one that stood a great chance of influencing tonight's family conference...`
`So she did not shoot back a retort, and could only watch in silence as the woman went up the stairs to the second floor, with Genji following behind.`
`So when someone tapped her shoulder from behind, she was so surprised, she almost choked.`
`It was Natsuhi...`
`".........Kyrie‐san.`
` Standing still in a place like this,`
` is something the matter...?"`
`"I, I'm sorry.`
` ......I was just a little fascinated by the portrait of the witch."`
`"......The Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, was it?`
` Something like—the revival of the Ushiromiya family to what it is today would never have been possible without the gold she gave...`
` ......A fantastical story, very much like Father."`
`Natsuhi spoke of her in her usual way.`
`{n}...She spoke from the position that the idea of a witch was just foolish, and that in the end, it was nothing more than Kinzo's ramblings.`
`...However, for some reason, that no longer felt right to Kyrie.`
`Just now, she herself had seen the Golden Witch come in from the entrance hall and climb up the stairs.`
`So Natsuhi's choice of words seemed almost like a refusal to accept her existence,`
` or as if she was leading her to think that she did not exist...`
`"...I'm sorry.`
` I think I'm feeling a bit of a headache.`
` ...I think I'll rest for a little while."`
`"Oh, is that so...?`
` Then I have some good headache medicine.`
` Allow me to prepare it for you..."`
`The hallway in front of Kinzo's study was filled with the scent of sweet poison particular to that green liquor...`
`Genji, who was completely used to it, did not grimace.`
`{n}...And the Golden Witch didn't grimace either.`
`"......When was the last time he left this room?"`
`"I believe it has already been several years."`
`"............He is that intent on making me a bird in a cage?`
` ...Alas.`
` ......Now you, who made that wish, are the bird in a cage.`
` ...The ghost of the study, are you not.`
` ......What a pitiful man to not recognize that."`
`"......He would probably continue his research until the day he could meet you again, even if he literally became a ghost."`
`"Is it love or madness or obsession?`
` ...I suppose they too will become magic if well enough developed.`
` ......You sad mage."`
`The witch grasped the doorknob to the study.`
`......When she did, there was a sound like that of flesh burning and splitting open.`
`...It was the sound of the doorknob literally burning the witch's hand.`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama..."`
`"What is this?`
` .........A magic ward!`
` ...That fool, is he unable to get by without relying on something like this...?"`
`"...I have heard that this door is painful for you, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` Shall I open it...?"`
`"No, ...it is fine.`
` If he wins, I will be a bird in a cage for all eternity.`
` ...If he loses, only the life of a laughingstock will be left, the life of a pitiful mage who went mad with love and lost everything."`
`"......Already, Kinzo and even I are nothing more than pieces laid out on the game board.`
` ...All that is left is for the result of the roulette to decide who wins and who loses.`
` .........Until the roulette shows its result, there is no need for me to be reunited with Kinzo."`
`The witch looked at her hand, which, although horribly burned, was beginning to heal bit by bit.`
`"......And so the ward, perhaps.`
` .........Hmph.`
` ...I see, that is also honorable.`
` ......Now, everything is on top of Kinzo's game board."`
`"I like it, Kinzo.`
` Allow me to enjoy my game with you.`
` ......Allow me to enjoy the final gamble and fall of an aged mage, who fell in love with me and threw away all his life...!!"`
`".........Who is it?"`
`"Excuse me...`
` I have brought lunch."`
`"Enter."`
`"......Excuse me."`
`After receiving approval, Kanon entered the VIP room, pushing the lunch serving cart.`
`...The servants called this room the witch's VIP room.`
`That was because they had been strictly ordered by Kinzo to always keep it cleaned so that it could be used at any time.`
`...And yet, guests were never allowed into this room, no matter who they were.`
`...That's why, at some point, the servants had started calling it the witch's VIP room,`
` supposed to be set aside only to welcome the special person Kinzo was waiting for—the witch from that portrait.`
`And today, Kanon learned that this was entirely correct...`
`When he entered the room, .........the witch with golden hair was gazing out the window.`
`Outside, the rain had already started to gather strength.`
`...As she looked out at the beautiful rose garden, which had taken several days' work to make ready for today, and saw the winds and rain ravage it,`
` was she lost in some sentimental feelings?`
`Kanon was not able to infer anything more from her back that faced him.`
`"...I will prepare your meal.`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`So Kanon went out of his way to call out the witch's name, ......because he wanted to make her turn around.`
`He wanted to know.`
` ......He wanted to know whether the witch who had tempted him and Shannon in the past......really had appeared again.`
`...When he did, ......the witch whose name had been called kept her back to him, ......and laughed.`
` Laughed, in a subdued voice.`
`Kanon was startled...`
`{n}It was almost as though she had read his mind, and knew that he had called to her out of a desire to make her turn around...`
`".........It smells good.`
` It appears that Krauss has employed a good cook."`
`"........................`
` ......Yes.`
` ...He is a cook called Gohda, who was employed in recent years."`
`"...There's nothing better than being skilled at cooking.`
` ...Gourmet food forms one of the three pillars of the pleasure of life in the human world.`
` The secret to not tiring of a thousand years is to have it in sufficience.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`Kanon and the witch's eyes met.`
`...And she grinned...`
`There could be no doubt.`
` Not even the slightest...`
`{n}This was without a doubt the witch from that day, {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`The witch that was once visible only to him and Shannon now finally held a form, and had arrived openly through the entrance hall as a guest...`
`".........{f:5:Bea}...{f:5:trice}......`
`......sama."`
`"It has been a long time.`
` .........Furniture called Kanon.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"...............It has...`
`...been a long time..."`
`Kanon tried not to forget a modicum of courtesy towards the guest.`
`{n}...But dark clouds had begun to enshroud his heart because of the visit of this suspicious witch, and on the day of the family conference at that...`
`"It looks to me that you are dying to know my purpose in appearing here.`
` ......Isn't that so...?"`
`"................................."`
`Kanon didn't force himself to answer.`
` ...This witch probably reads minds.`
`{n}...So it would be pointless to go to all the trouble of saying it out loud.`
`.........Of course, even that rebellious spirit of his would be read.`
`So the witch snickered at Kanon's childish resistance.`
`"......I came to resolve my final promise with Kinzo."`
`"Your final promise with......the Master...?"`
`"......I lent Kinzo a mountain of gold.`
` ...When Kinzo gives that up, it will be returned to me with interest.`
` .........I came here tonight to receive that."`
`"...............I don't know what you are talking about."`
`However, anxiety began to gather in his heart.`
`{n}......This witch never had anything good to say.`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` You are not wrong!`
` Witches have nothing good to say.`
` You are correct."`
`"Be that as it may, witches, like blunt scissors, can be put to use.`
` ...Sometimes, there are people like King Solomon who succeed in great exploits."`
`".........In most cases, one does not meet with a good fate such as those described in fairy tales, of course?`
` *cackle*cackle*...!`
` .........But Kinzo is crafty.`
` He has incorporated even my collection of interest into his own ritual."`
`"Is he a tremendous mage, surpassing even me?`
` ......Or else a fool possessed by madness?`
` ...Interesting.`
` Truly interesting...!"`
`Kanon couldn't guess what the witch was muttering and laughing about.`
`...All he knew was...`
`...that anything this witch deemed worthy of laughter...`
`must have the exact opposite meaning to the rest of them.`
`......And rising to the back of his mind were the horrifying words the witch had spat at him in the past.`
`Did you think I would lend them that power without any compensation?`
`{n}I'll lend a hand in love.`
` And my compensation shall be one ticket to watch the cruel fate that the two of them will eventually meet.`
`Even after one thousand years, no better show exists...!`
`".................................`
` ...Could it be... ...You......"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Gehehehhahahahahahahahaha...!!"`
`".........Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old.`
` You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key."`
`The witch suddenly began to recite a bizarre poem...`
`{n}It was something he remembered hearing.`
`"Could that be............the witch's epitaph..."`
`There was no doubt.`
`{n}...It was the epitaph accompanying the portrait of the witch that had been hung by Kinzo.`
`The relatives imagined that it almost certainly pointed to the location of the hidden gold,`
` but no one knew what it meant.`
`The witch had suddenly begun reciting that epitaph.`
`"...Kanon.`
` As furniture, you must have heard about this from Kinzo.`
` .........The day when everything will be returned to the Golden Land...has come."`
`"Rejoice.`
` ...The time has finally come for your shameful days as furniture to end."`
`"........................hh."`
`"I believe you have been wanting that for a long time.`
` ...To furniture, whose existence has no value, just existing day to day must be nothing but agony."`
`"......For those with souls, the world of the living is worth clinging onto, but those without find it to be nothing but suffering.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`Complicated expressions flitted across Kanon's face.`
`......It was the day of release that he had been looking forward to.`
`{n}...However, the coming of this day had been mercilessly sudden.`
`And the hateful tone of the witch, who had proclaimed this day of rest, made it somehow difficult to accept.`
`...Kanon wasn't even able to decide what emotion he should feel...`
`"......Why are you not happy?`
` Could you actually still have some attachments to this world?`
` ......As furniture?"`
`"............I have no...`
`...attachments.`
` Because I am...`
`.........furniture."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` ...You truly are a model piece of furniture.`
` ......Very good, very good.`
` ......However, to have no lingering regrets at all... How deeply uninteresting this is."`
`"......Are you saying that regrets are your pleasure?"`
`"Precisely!`
` Most witches who live for a thousand years get tired of life!`
` In order to escape boredom, I adorn people's fates with fruit and brandy and cook them like cakes.`
` I find humans dancing through oppressive fates inside an oven to be so very entertaining...!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` I've made somewhat of a name for myself in this field, you know?`
` ......So much so that unexpected guests occasionally come from afar to witness my culinary skills.`
` ...Heheheheh, mere furniture can't understand this—I am wasting my time."`
`Kanon wasn't able to understand what the witch was saying.`
`However, he realized well enough that this was a terrifying being who treated the fates of humans as a show,`
` and was getting enjoyment out of doing them some kind of harm.`
`......However, furniture had no soul or life, much less a fate.`
` Pitiful "furniture" did nothing but serve until the day they would be released from the world.`
`...To furniture like that, the witch, who had come to release them from everything, was also a being overflowing with mercy...`
`Even though the day that Kanon had been waiting impatiently for had come, he was unable to readily accept it, and this greatly bewildered him.`
`...Why was that...?`
`{n}.........The face of Shannon, the person he loved as a sister, rose to his mind.`
`{n}......And for some reason, Jessica's face did too.`
`".....................kh."`
`Kanon bit his lower lip painfully.`
`......Thinking of Jessica was not permitted for furniture.`
`{n}He had been aware of that, and had found fault with Shannon's relationship, ...so how could he remember Jessica at a time like this?`
`......He felt a little ashamed by how weak he was.`
`{n}And to forget about Jessica, he turned his thoughts to Shannon.`
`Shannon is also furniture.`
`{n}......On the day everything returns to nothing, there was no reason she shouldn't be happy.`
`......But Shannon,`
` .........through her relationship with George, had come to know an emotion that shouldn't be known by furniture.`
`Even though she wasn't qualified to be bound with him, she was still wallowing in a dream that she wasn't permitted to have.`
`Could Shannon...`
`......accept something like this, now, with open arms?`
`......Impossible.`
` ...Shannon would have lingering regrets.`
`{n}......That would probably become a great source of pain and torture for Shannon.`
`And those regrets.........had been planted by none other than this witch.`
`Why?`
` Just because that would be "more interesting"......!`
`"......Shannon......should have been waiting impatiently for this day, but now she will have emotions that she must not know,`
` ......and will probably have a very hard time forced upon her.`
` .........I...thank you for gifting us furniture the day of our release."`
`"......And...I hate you for making this day difficult for Shannon to accept...!"`
`"I wanted to make you feel pain from your regrets as well, just like Shannon.`
` ......However, with stubborn simplicity you continued to remain furniture, and never allowed me to lead you on."`
`"............However, it looks like you loved Shannon too dearly, didn't you?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Shannon's regrets became your regrets.`
` ......Will that turn into hatred for me...?"`
`"................................."`
`"If you want to kill me, you can try.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` As Kinzo's furniture, you should have that much power, at least?`
` However, if you kill me, the day of rest for you furniture will not come for all eternity."`
`"......Could you withstand that......?`
` Can you really reject your release by me......?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` .........Kneel!!"`
`"Wh‐......what...?!"`
`"Kneel and kiss my shoes.`
` .........Otherwise, I will leave this place.`
` ...I will go back and never show myself again for all eternity."`
`"............So, Kanon?`
` Could you withstand that...?"`
`".....................khh......"`
`"If the door to the Golden Land is opened, your life as furniture, that has been full of hardship, will end.`
` ......If you desire, I will even give you life as a human.`
` After that, you will be on the same level as Jessica!`
` Surely you want to know of it, the taste of love...!"`
`".........I know even if you try to hide it, you see...?`
` You grew jealous seeing Shannon wallow in the swamp of sweet love.`
` ...You are sorely tempted to know the taste of love...`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"......Stop it...... Stop it...!`
` Are you trying to lead me on again......?!`
` I won't be reduced to a toy to please you...!"`
`"Hoh.`
` Then I will make do with Shannon.`
` You weren't the only seed I sowed.`
` There are sometimes those that don't bear fruit."`
`".........You who laid hand upon the key must journey as follows to the Golden Land.`
` On the first twilight, sacrifice the six chosen by the key.`
` On the second twilight, those who remain shall tear apart the two who are close..."`
`The witch recited the epitaph again.`
`{n}It was so sudden, and diverged so strongly from the current topic.`
`However, her challenging smile made it seem almost as though she were using that epitaph as a threat to Kanon.`
`".........Do you not understand?`
` ...For the ritual of the epitaph to succeed, on the "second twilight", two who are close must be sacrificed."`
`"............It could be any two who are close.`
` A husband and wife, ......or even a pair of lovers.`
` ......Who will be selected is up to me to decide on a whim, following the rules of the ritual."`
`"......Don't you think that there is no one more fitting to be a sacrifice for the second twilight than Shannon as she is now...?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`".........Wh‐......what a dirty........."`
`Kanon learned, then.`
` ...He had thought that he had given up everything, and lived until today as furniture, like furniture should.`
`...But in reality, that wasn't true.`
`He had loved Shannon too dearly.`
` ...And so, when Shannon was in pain, Kanon shared in that.`
`If only Shannon had continued to exist as furniture,`
` living indifferently like Kanon, without any attachments to this world, they wouldn't have had to be in so much pain...!`
`The witch planned to toy with Shannon, who had learned the taste of love—`
`no, who she had taught the taste of love—as she killed her.`
`She would not invite her to the Golden Land as a merciful release,`
` but would make her a sacrifice for that evil ritual, after dealing her the limits of torture and pain...!`
`And this witch would probably actually make Shannon meet this horrible fate, for no other reason than it would be interesting for her.`
`......Furthermore, she was threatening to do that so that she could make Kanon, who hadn't submitted to the witch even once until now, finally surrender......`
`It was that simple.`
` ...In the end, though he had tried resisting the witch to avoid pleasing her, he had only made things interesting for her.`
`......After all, he was furniture.`
` No, a toy.`
` ......They were nothing but toys meant only to distract her from her boredom...!`
`"...............Damn......it.................."`
`"What will you do, Kanon...?`
` If you kneel, I may even hold back from choosing Shannon as a sacrifice...`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` I always wanted the chance to break a toy like you.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, kuhihihihihihihihi!!"`
`Without even a fragment of elegance, the witch sneered at Kanon with a vulgar laugh.`
`...Yes, even before Kanon had made up his mind, she had seen through to his surrender...`
`".................................kh..."`
`......Kanon...............got down on one knee, and chose to genuflect before the witch...`
`He didn't care what happened to himself.`
`...However, ......just the fact that Shannon,`
` who during his days as furniture had given him his only reason to live, was being toyed with,`
` ......that alone was something that he couldn't overlook...`
`Therefore,`
` ......something like kissing the shoes of the witch...was an easy oath for Kanon to make.`
`......At the time that his quivering lips actually touched the witch's shoe...`
`...{f:5:Beatrice}, after allowing a look of ecstasy to rise to her face, ...let out an ear‐splitting laugh.`
`In that moment, the witch who had tired of a thousand years of life was completely filled with the evil emotion that was her only raison d'être......`
`Lunch had ended, and the relatives had moved to the parlor.`
`Rosa had bought a high‐class brand of black tea from a famous store in Ginza.`
` That had been served, and the inside of the parlor was filled with a very nice aroma...`
`Since the children were together with the adults,`
` the adults were, at least on the surface, interacting like relatives, talking peacefully about recent events and how their children were growing up.`
`It had started raining outside, so the children were unable to go out,`
` and had no choice but to sit here like this, watching TV.`
`Like a true TV‐kid,`
` Maria was watching vapid daytime programs one after another without getting bored, and was giggling all to herself.`
`It seemed that Battler had joined in at first, deepening his relationship with Maria,`
` but he had gotten up early that morning, and so was gradually attacked by waves of drowsiness...`
`"......fuaaaaaah..."`
`"Oh, that's a big yawn.`
` Did you get up really early this morning?"`
`"...Well, something like that.`
` I started to relax and release all my tension, and then I got sleepy while I was listening to the sound of the rain."`
`"Tension?`
` Heheh, you go around making yourself the center of attention and now you're saying you were tense?"`
`"That's me, I guess.`
` ......fuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah......"`
`Battler gave a great yawn once again, and slowly lay down on the sofa.`
`He really did look tired.`
`George and the others had started talking to him, taking his yawns as a sign of boredom, but when they realized he really was sleepy, they decided to let him be.`
`"My, my.`
` They say that if you lie down right after eating, you'll become a mackerel.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐ho...!"`
`"......Stop kidding around.`
` Gohda‐san said that tonight would be calf steak.`
` In a minute it's gonna end up as mackerel steak."`
`"Kumasawa‐san.`
` The guy really does look tired.`
` You think you could bring him a blanket?"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` Here you go."`
`Kumasawa brought a blanket over from the shelf.`
`{n}...The spacious parlor wasn't cold, but the air had gotten a little chilly.`
`So when the blanket was placed over Battler, he immediately wrapped himself up in it, and curled up like a turtle retreating into its shell.`
`"...You really were sleepy.`
` When do you want to wake up?`
` I'll take care of it."`
`"......Nah, I don't care when.`
` ......You can wake me up if there's something you want,`
` ...and if there's nothing, you can let me sleep forever.`
` ......Good night..."`
`"Uu?`
` Battler sleeping?`
` Naptime?`
` Naptime?`
` Uu‐uu, me too!"`
`"H‐hey, Maria.`
` Battler's sleepy, so you gotta leave him alone.`
` Kumasawa‐san, could we get another blanket?"`
`It was doubtful that Maria really wanted to take a nap.`
`{n}She probably just saw Battler wrapped up in a blanket and wanted to do the same.`
`When she received the blanket from Kumasawa, she joyfully wrapped herself up in it and set up camp again in front of the TV.`
`"Sheesh.`
` ...Even though all us cousins are finally together after six years.`
` Dude doesn't have a clue that he's the main guest of this family conference, does he?"`
`"......I can hear youuu...`
` ...I've had a nice peaceful lunch, and there's even a typhoon and rain outside.`
` ......There's nothing to do, and what that means is: it's not my turn yet."`
`"I wonder about that.`
` If you have a passive attitude like that, and don't do anything unless something happens, your life will be pretty boring, you know?"`
`"......No, that's not what I mean.`
` ...How should I say it?`
` ...In times like this, I've decided to think this way.`
` ......It isn't my turn."`
`"If this were a play, it wouldn't be my turn to go on stage.`
` ......So the best thing to do is stay on the wings."`
`"You're always the main character of your own life, right?`
` Why are you acting like a supporting actor?`
` ...You have to get up on the stage yourself without being pushed."`
`".........That's not what I mean.`
` I'm just saying it's not my turn right now...`
` kuaaaaaaaaaaah......`
` Sorry, I'm sleepy and my mind's a mess.`
` Just let me be......`
` *mumble*......"`
`"So it seems.`
` You're so sleepy that you aren't making any sense.`
` ...Let's leave him alone now."`
`"I can't let that one slide.`
` ...You are always the main character in your own life.`
` I kinda want to have a serious argument with Battler about that!"`
`"He's just half‐asleep.`
` Don't take him too seriously."`
`".........I dunno why, but...`
` That kind of personality, saying you don't want to get up on the stage because you can't be the main character.`
` ......Something about that really pissed me off..."`
`With distant eyes, Jessica gazed out the window at the gray rose garden obscured by rain...`
`When she put her forehead up against the glass, it felt as though the pleasantly cool sensation would chase away memories that she didn't want to remember...`
`"............It wasn't your turn yet, was that it?`
` ...Then, ......when {i:will} you get up on the stage......"`
`In that case, who {i:is} the main character on this stage...?`
`".........You're just doing whatever you goddamn want!`
` ...What the shit is this?`
` ......This is just demented...!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!`
` Your argument regarding 18 or 19 people, which you use as a basis to deny me, was truly ludicrous, you see.`
` So I merely tried a different move."`
`"...The greatest basis upon which you deny me is simply that I was not laid out as a piece on the game board.`
` In that case, I can simply play the queen first like this, can I not?`
` ...Isn't opening the path for the queen in the first move one of the classic plays in chess?"`
`".........Real fucking funny...`
` How the hell...can I accept something like this?!`
` A witch just came walking in right through the entrance hall?!`
` What a royal load of bullshit!!"`
`"What's this...?`
` In the last game, I let you make moves as and when you pleased, you know...?`
` All I have done on this occasion is to move a piece to match your moves.`
` .........Are you resigning already on the very first turn...?"`
`"......U‐.........up yours...`
` Like hell I am!`
` Who's gonna resign?!`
` Great move, why don't you just keep on playing however you like."`
`"I get it, your turn is far from over.`
` ...Move however you like!`
` Form a huge battle formation while you can."`
`"I will definitely endure.`
` I will definitely corner you!!`
` Come at me as best you can—I don't want you to have any excuses."`
`"......This much isn't even close to enough to make me accept something like a witch."`
`"...That's right, just now, it looked like you fixed Maria's candy with magic,`
` but you might have actually had another one of the same candy hidden in your pocket, and switched them with some fancy showmanship, making it only look like you had fixed it with magic!`
` Yeah, that's right, that has to be it, and it's no good, it's no goddamn good...!"`
`"......Hohoh?`
` Rosa saw the moment when the candy split into butterflies, did she not?"`
`"Whatever, I don't care!!`
` That was a hallucination or a trick, or...otherwise, she just saw it wrong!!`
` That isn't a big problem!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` So you throw out the part you can't explain as trivial?`
` ......I see, is that your move in response to mine...?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*... You've dug your own grave.`
` ...Ushiromiya Battler...`
` Fuhahahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` It still isn't your turn yet.`
` Allow me to continue my move for a little longer.`
` It has barely begun, the Turn of the Witch!!"`
`When they started hearing Battler's snores, the relatives went their separate ways, leaving the parlor and letting Battler sleep in silence.`
`Even though it had been so lively in the parlor with so many people gathered there,`
` ......when all of them scattered at once and were sucked into the vast mansion, it created an eerie silence, with no sound except that of the rain...`
`"Nope.`
` I've never once met a person like that.`
` ...Aneki?"`
`"...I've never met her.`
` ......Kyrie‐san, is that true?"`
`"......Even I only greeted her quickly when she came into the entrance hall.`
` She looked like she was a little over twenty.`
` I told her my name, but she didn't tell me hers.`
` ...She was being guided by Genji‐san, and I saw her go up to the second floor."`
`"So it'd probably be faster to find Genji‐san and hear the story from him directly.`
` ......Still, what a strange turn of affairs..."`
`The mystery woman had spoken to Kyrie.`
`{n}Without naming herself, she had sneered that Kyrie already had a vague idea of who she was.`
`......And the person that brought to mind...`
`{n}...was her look‐alike, the witch of the portrait...`
`"Was she trying to say that she's...`
`...the witch of the portrait?"`
`"That's what I understood her to be laughing at.`
` ......Even though it was our first meeting, she spoke as though she knew I'm your second wife."`
`"......Aneki.`
` You really don't know someone like that?"`
`"Stop asking me that.`
` I have never seen a blonde woman like that go in or out of this mansion!"`
`"None of that matters.`
` ...The problem is what happens if that woman starts callin' herself {f:5:Beatrice}, if she starts callin' herself the manager of Father's assets."`
`"Or, ...maybe she plans to call herself his mistress's daughter, and demand a portion of the inheritance.`
` ......Either way, an outrageous joker has been slipped into the deck.`
` .........Did Nii‐san call her?`
` ...Or did Father...?"`
`"This is bad.`
` ...We've been thinking that if we did a good enough job cornering Aniki in our discussion, we might be able to work things out.`
` ......But this takes us back to square one."`
`"............`
` ...I don't know what kind of schemes you've been plotting when I'm not around, baby,`
` ......but it looks like we've been given a little time to form a counter‐strategy."`
`"...Yeah.`
` Thinking about what would have happened if Miss Blondie had suddenly appeared at the dinner table and scared the shit out of us,`
` we should be glad we've at least been given a little time to discuss a counter‐strategy."`
`"...There's only so many counter‐strategies we can use if we don't know what she came to do.`
` ......What could she be after...?"`
`"Isn't it obvious!`
` It's to claim that she's the rightful heir to Father's inheritance!`
` Father is still captivated by {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` If the two of them had a daughter, he'd be bound to say he wants to hand her all of his assets!`
` She might even thrust some strange will before us!"`
`"...Sure, if we took it to court, we might be able to claim a quarter of a half of it...`
` ......But we probably wouldn't be able to split the inheritance until that was resolved."`
`"...That's a problem.`
` For me and for Rudolf!`
` And of course, for Rosa too, right?"`
`"......For all of our various situations, we need a large sum of money urgently.`
` ...It's our biggest weak point.`
` Then, ......what are they after?`
` Kyrie, ...can you tell?"`
`".................................`
` ......It's the first I've heard of it, but one of the premises here is that we have an urgent need for a large sum of money, right?"`
`".....................nn......"`
`"......Kyrie‐san.`
` When you're on the offensive in a man's business, that's the time you need funding.`
` Please understand that."`
`".........What's thiiis, Rudolf?`
` You hadn't told Kyrie‐san about it?"`
`"...Sorry.`
` I wasn't really hiding it.`
` ......The truth is, we've been having a bit of a—"`
`"It's alright.`
` You decided it wasn't necessary to tell me about it,`
` so I won't press you about it here."`
`"......What's more important is finding out what the Golden Witch is after, right?"`
`"Yes...`
` .........Putting together everything we've said, can you see what move the enemy will make against us?"`
`Rudolf had a certain measure of trust in Kyrie's unique thinking technique, "chessboard thinking".`
`Of course, it didn't give him any more peace of mind than fortune telling,`
` but every time Rudolf was concocting some important strategy, he would give a great deal of thought to Kyrie's advice...`
`For a while, Kyrie pressed her finger against her forehead, considering...`
`".........Judging by the fact that her coming here was kept hidden until today,`
` one of her goals is some kind of surprise that she wants to give us."`
`".........We can't know whether that has something to do with assets or being recognized as a relative."`
`"However, because her visit was kept hidden until today,`
` maybe we can say that she didn't want to get hit with a countermeasure by notifying us in advance.`
` Which means that it seems her goal is one where it would be disadvantageous to her if we did take some countermeasure.`
` ...Understand?"`
`"I get it...`
` For example, if it was something like a will which Dad had written previously, or acknowledgement as a blood relative plus accompanying proof,`
` if we assume she's brought something like that..."`
`"......then if it was completely unshakeable—if it was rock‐solid proof—you'd think she'd actually have announced it beforehand."`
`"...That's right.`
` Since we are in a position to doubt her, she should have made us bring our lawyers and experts,`
` and thrust some completely undeniable proof before us.`
` If she could."`
`"Hmmmm.`
` ...So just given that the enemy's aimin' for a surprise attack, that alone tells us she couldn't beat us with an honest attack from the front.`
` Makes sense.`
` If you've got a trump card that'll win for sure, you gotta play it out boldly.`
` Play it in a roundabout way, and odds are you're goin' to tarnish its impact."`
`"......To skip to the conclusion,`
` ...we should probably expect that some huge surprise will be thrust in front of us,`
` something related either directly or indirectly to the inheritance problem that everyone is so infatuated with.`
` ...The other party is probably under the impression that they will be able to overpower us with the impact of this alone."`
`"......However, even if this carries with it a significant impact, it is not absolute."`
`"In other words, ......we have enough leeway to take advantage of this."`
`"You've really got brains!`
` Even understandin' just this much is really reassurin'!`
` So you're tellin' us not to get sucked into our opponent's pace."`
`"...In the end, it's an extremely simple conclusion.`
` No matter what the opponent brings up, interact calmly, without panicking.`
` ......That's Negotiation 101.`
` I really can't call that predicting our opponent's thoughts."`
`"Come on.`
` ...Just like usual, that was pretty good.`
` .........Now that we know that we have a little leeway to attack, it gives us a little more room to relax."`
`"What we don't know is how she is connected to Krauss nii‐san.`
` ......Is it a surprise for Krauss nii‐san too, or was the person who called her here none other than Krauss nii‐san himself?"`
`"......If it's the latter, it might make things very troublesome."`
`"............Yes.`
` ...Secretly calling a mystery woman on the day of the family conference.`
` ...That detestable style somehow feels like Nii‐san."`
`"Aneki, let's handle it like this.`
` ...As long as she can't clearly prove her identity, we won't acknowledge her as having any status whatsoever."`
`"That would be best.`
` ......In point of fact, she hasn't even named herself to Kyrie‐san.`
` ...We can't let our conference be disturbed by the statements of some unknown woman."`
`"......She might show us proof that she's a blood relative or something.`
` If she can show that Father's blood runs through her veins, like with a maternity record document, there's nothin' we can do."`
`"We can suspect any proof of being fake.`
` Even if it is the real thing, in order to prove that she is the person mentioned, we would need to involve a hospital.`
` ...At the very least, it will be impossible to prove that now, on Rokkenjima."`
`".........Yes, that's it exactly.`
` In other words, what it boils down to is this:`
` No matter what is shown to us now on Rokkenjima, it can't be accepted as truth."`
`"So we can't believe anything until the typhoon passes and they prove it to us at the proper place.`
` ...*giggle*."`
`"Constantly finding fault like that is your speciality, Aneki.`
` This is gonna be all down to you."`
`"Are you an idiot?`
` You'll be helping too.`
` ......We need money.`
` And quickly, and a large sum!`
` We're all in this together."`
`".........There's no way I'm having my prospects of an inheritance destroyed now by some mystery woman who popped out of nowhere...!"`
`It was only at a time like this that Rudolf and Eva united as siblings,`
` sickened by the idea that their own inheritance might be snatched away by an outsider.`
`Kyrie noticed how indomitable they looked, shook her head slightly, and gave a small sigh as she looked out the window.`
`Outside, there was still a strong rain falling, and everything was gray, having lost all vibrance.`
`It felt like the lush garden that the sun had shone on earlier had never existed.`
`For some reason, the words Eva had said just a short while ago kept repeating in Kyrie's head.`
`.........It boils down to this.`
` No matter what is shown to us now on Rokkenjima, it can't be accepted as truth.`
`There was an odd nuance to those words.`
`Right now, this island was closed off by the typhoon and isolated.`
`{n}There were no official institutions here, and no hospital.`
`So, no matter what institution had issued what kind of documentation, on this island, one could claim that it was all fiction.`
` It was impossible to prove that something was the truth.`
`They were cut off from the outside world, and all truths proven in the outside world would be called "fiction"...`
`So did that mean...`
`...that now, on this Rokkenjima, there was nothing that was truthful?`
`......That everything would be controlled by "fiction"?`
`It almost gave the illusion...`
`...that separate from the human world made from truth...`
`was another world called fiction, in which they had been shut away.`
`......Kyrie remembered what that woman had looked like one more time.`
`And she remembered the woman's figure, and the witch of the portrait.`
`On this island, which had been isolated from the world of humans, and shut away in the world of nonhumans, ......a nonhuman being had visited.`
`No matter what she did, Kyrie couldn't help think of the smile that had appeared on that woman's face as anything other than ominous......`
`In trying to understand that ominous smile,`
` ...it feels like my chessboard thinking mistook a vital premise.`
`...That's right,`
` that smile seemed like that of something nonhuman looking down on me.`
` I had reasoned based on the assumption that our opponent was a "human" like us.`
`......However,`
` just like this island now, she may be a being that is not human, and human values may not apply to her.`
`In that case...`
`......all reasoning is useless.`
`{n}For what reason was the witch invited here today?`
`.........Only one thing is certain.`
` ...Right this very moment, she is staying somewhere in this vast mansion...`
`"......Maria.`
` ......Around lunchtime today, we.........met someone outside, right?`
` A woman.`
` Who......was she?"`
`"...Uu.`
` Said it a lot.`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"Maria, have you ever met {f:5:Beatrice} before...?"`
`"Uu.`
` See her every year."`
`"Every year...?`
` In this mansion on Rokkenjima?"`
`"Uu."`
`"...I don't know what "uu" means!`
` Is that true?!"`
`"......Yeah."`
`"How long have you been seeing her?`
` How many years ago did it start?!"`
`"...Uu.`
` ......Dunno."`
`"You don't know?!`
` Why?!`
` Last year?`
` Two years ago?!"`
`"......Longer.`
` ......Uu."`
`Rosa was aghast.`
` ...Only the Ushiromiya mansion existed on this island.`
` So there was no way that there were any humans other than themselves on this island.`
`And yet, Maria said that she had been meeting with that suspicious woman every year during the family conference......`
`If what Maria said was the truth,`
` ......then that strange woman called {f:5:Beatrice} had been at the family conference every year.`
`......That's insane.`
`Is she saying that some eerie woman was at the family conference every year, and none of us ever noticed it...?!`
`Even though Rosa had just met her herself a couple of hours ago in the rose garden,`
` she was overcome with a strange emotion which told her not to accept her existence...`
`"What" in the world did I meet with earlier today in the rose garden, as the typhoon grew close and the winds blew strong......?`
`"......Maria.`
` So, you said that you see her every year.`
` ...What do you do together?"`
`"Uu.`
` Sing songs, learn magic.`
` Learn how to draw magic circles."`
`"Re‐...really?`
` That's incredible.`
` ......Maria, you often scribble—`
`sorry, draw magic circles, in your notebook, right?`
` Did she teach you that?"`
`"Uu!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} draws what they should look like!`
` Look! Look!"`
`Maria joyfully fished around in her handbag.`
`......Then, she took out a notebook and started opening its pages.`
`Most of the pages were covered with drawings that were literally scribbles.`
`All of them were occult‐like things,`
` and while it might sound rude to Maria who was joyfully flipping through the pages, they were all creepy.`
`"Look! Here!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} drew these for me!!`
` Uu!!"`
`On each page Maria opened to, there was another eerie magic circle that had been drawn.`
`......Furthermore, at a glance, Rosa realized that Maria hadn't drawn them.`
`The strength of the strokes, the thickness of the lines, how clean the shape was.`
`{n}......This by itself wasn't enough to guess the background of the person who had drawn it,`
` but it was enough for Rosa to understand that it was definitely someone older than Maria.`
`Rosa had to accept it now.`
`...There really was a person on this Rokkenjima who she hadn't even known existed,`
` and this person had been playing with Maria during the family conference every year.`
`".........Maria.`
` Umm, does this witch {f:5:Beatrice} live here...?`
` Or does she live outside the island like us...?"`
`"Uu.`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice} is the witch of Rokkenjima, so she lives on this island."`
`".........So, you're saying that she's on the island even when it isn't the family conference, ...right......?"`
`"Uu."`
`"I don't know what "uu" means!!`
` Well?!"`
`"...!`
` ............Yeah.`
` ...Uu."`
`Oh......oh my gosh, oh my gosh.........`
`{n}I can't believe it, I can't believe it...!`
`How long has this unknown witch been living on this island?!`
`I used to live on this island.`
`{n}I lived on this island, passing the time in the mansion, in the rose garden.`
`And even so, I never encountered a witch like that,`
` ......never,`
` ......I think.....................`
`"Mama......?`
` Mama......?`
` What's wrong......?`
` Mama...?!"`
`"......My head.........hurts..."`
`...I was probably getting a little mixed up with my memories from when I was a young girl.`
`When I was a young girl, unlike Maria, I was very frightened of witches.`
`{n}So for me, the name {f:5:Beatrice} was a synonym for something frightening.`
`......So it must be that my feeling of fear from my days as a young girl has been revived, because a woman calling herself that has appeared...`
`......She couldn't be a witch.`
` ......She's obviously a {i:human} calling herself {f:5:Beatrice}, right?`
`Oh, yes...`
` ......That witch entrusted me with an envelope...`
` What in the world could that be?`
`Rosa pulled that Western envelope out of her pocket.`
`...It was the Western envelope which bore the Ushiromiya crest which Kinzo used on his personal letters.`
` ......And it had even been sealed with the red sealing wax by the Head's Ring, which Kinzo held.`
`.........Which meant...this envelope belonged to the Ushiromiya head.`
`{n}...In other words, it was from Father.`
`Why was a woman calling herself {f:5:Beatrice} holding it, and why did she give it to me?`
`That's right,`
` I'm sure she said to read this aloud at dinner.`
`{n}.........What in the world could be written inside...?`
`Anxiety gripped Rosa,`
` as if opening this envelope might release some kind of monumental disaster...`
`......However, at the same time, a little curiosity sprouted up, causing her to want to find out what was written inside before the other siblings.`
`Using common sense, .........one could guess that a huge decision somehow related to Father's inheritance was probably written inside.`
`Actually, ...since he had given it to a woman calling herself {f:5:Beatrice}, there was no way that wasn't related.`
` ......Did this mean that he wanted the inheritance split not between four, but between five, including her?`
`..................I need a large sum of money, ...and I can't wait long.`
`I do feel like a sinful daughter for discussing the distribution of Father's inheritance while he's still alive.`
` ......However, I'm no longer at a stage where I can afford to keep everything pretty.`
`...And I'm even consulting with Rudolf nii‐san and Eva nee‐san in order to get some money out of Krauss nii‐san.`
` With myself in this situation, .........I can't help but sense something ominous in the appearance of the witch...`
`.........What could be written in here?`
`{n}......I'm sure there must be something frightening written.`
`.........Shall I first read it secretly myself?`
`The witch had requested it be done at the dinner table, when everyone was gathered.`
` ......However, in that case, couldn't she just read it aloud at the dinner table herself?`
`Why did she go to all the trouble of entrusting it to me?`
` .........Did that mean, basically, that it didn't matter whether I secretly read it beforehand...?`
`......It would be better to secretly read the contents first.`
`{n}...I understand that it would be breaking my promise.`
`......But this is no longer the time to keep things pretty...`
`It would probably be good to discuss it with Eva nee‐san and Rudolf nii‐san, depending on the contents...`
` ...Nee‐san and the rest are always really good thinkers when it comes to this kind of thing......`
`As I gulped, ......and put my hand to the red sealing wax...`
`...Something suddenly pulled on my sleeve, and I let out a small shriek.`
`".........Wha‐what?!`
` M‐.........Maria.`
` Don't scare me like that.`
` What?"`
`"...Uu.........`
` ............No."`
`"Huh......?"`
`Maria was making the same ominous expression Rosa had seen on the witch, sending a tingle up her spine...`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice} told you to read that letter during dinner, Mama.`
` ......You can't break a promise with a witch.`
` ............Kihihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi..."`
`"Tha‐...that's not it.`
` I just wanted to look at the envelope for a second.`
` ......I'll keep my promise.`
` ......After all, Mama always tells you to keep your promises.`
` ...Of course Mama will keep her promise..."`
`"Yep.`
` Mama's a good girl.`
` ...Kihihihihihihihihihi..."`
`"Th‐`
`......that laugh.`
` ......It isn't cute, so stop it."`
`".........Uu."`
`"Come to think of it, you received a letter too, Maria.`
` .........What was written inside?"`
`"Haven't opened it.`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice} said I mustn't open it until it's time to open it.`
` So taking good care of it.`
` ...Uu."`
`"I, ......I see.`
` ...You listen well to what {f:5:Beatrice} says, don't you, Maria."`
`"Uu.`
` I'm {f:5:Beatrice}'s disciple, so I listen well to what my master says."`
`"......I, .........I see."`
`"......?!"`
`Rosa realized something.`
` ......Mixed in with Maria's gaze...was the light of a person other than Maria.`
`...If she broke the rules, and opened the envelope here, {f:5:Beatrice} would definitely find out about it.`
`......Because Maria was the witch's disciple.`
`{n}.........Maria communicated with that witch......`
`"...Mama will keep her promise.`
` So tell {f:5:Beatrice} not to worry, okay?"`
`"Uu!`
` I'll tell her."`
`"...Hey, Maria.`
` ...I want to speak with {f:5:Beatrice}, so what could I do to meet her, I wonder...?"`
`"Don't know.`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice} is very fickle, so she always shows herself suddenly.`
` I don't know a way to get her to meet me."`
`"......But you know, she's always watching me.`
` So when I get in trouble, she'll definitely save me afterwards.`
` ...She's gone invisible, and is hiding close to me, I just know it.`
` ......Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi."`
`"D‐......don't I always tell you to stop that laughing!!"`
`Rosa reflexively hit Maria on the head.`
` ......That put a stop to Maria's laughing voice, ...but it wasn't able to erase the ominous color that had risen to her eyes.`
`Rosa made a pact with herself.`
` ...She swore that, at least until they left this island, she would not leave Maria alone.`
`.........She couldn't allow an unknown being to make direct contact with her daughter anymore......`
`"...Maria hasn't come back.`
` ......I wonder if she's being scolded by Auntie Rosa again."`
`Ever since they had met Maria in the airport, she had constantly been making a huge fuss about Halloween.`
`...But it seemed she had cut loose a little too much,`
` and acted a little too boisterous on the plane, on the boat, and during lunch, because Rosa had warned her several times.`
`In times like that, Auntie Rosa would rarely scold her in front of people.`
`{n}...More commonly, she would call Maria into the shadows, and scold her when they were alone.`
`So since Maria had been called off somewhere, they thought she must be getting scolded.`
`When they looked at the clock, they realized that it was almost six.`
`{n}They couldn't really imagine that Maria had been being scolded this whole time.`
`Perhaps it had come time for some anime she watched every week to start, or something.`
` She had probably just decided to stay in the mansion's parlor.`
`"It could be that Battler‐sama has woken up and they are playing together."`
`"Well, Maria‐chan must have thought of Battler‐kun as sort of a new friend.`
` ...I'm sure she had tons of fun when she played Halloween with Battler‐kun at the airport."`
`"Battler was messing around a lot himself.`
` That dude's gotten big, but he hasn't changed a bit on the inside from how he used to be."`
`"That's true.`
` ...I get the feeling that Battler‐sama was gracious enough to remain as he was six years ago."`
`"Shannon, you remember how Battler‐kun was six years ago?"`
`"Yes.`
` Because he was, well, very energetic.`
` *giggle*."`
`"I also remember how the four of us used to play six years ago.`
` Shannon acted a lot like a big sister."`
`"Yeah.`
` I get the feeling she was more level‐headed back then.`
` Ahahahaha!"`
`"Ba‐...back then I, umm, ......didn't know my place, so...`
` Umm, I must apologize for all my poor conduct..."`
`"......There's no need for all those professional manners.`
` Your work aside, when you're taking your break like you are now, I'd like it if we could all be friendly together like we were back then."`
`"Yeah, totally.`
` ...There's no reason why you can't separate the servant Shannon from the off‐duty Sayo.`
` ......You aren't a slave, you're just working a job as a servant, right?"`
`".........I think of you, Shannon,`
` ...no, Sayo, as my oldest friend."`
`"............Thank you very much, Milady."`
`It seemed that Shannon understood what lurked under Jessica's words.`
`{n}......Because she had heard a little bit from Jessica and Kanon about what had happened between them.`
`".................."`
`Apparently, George had also been informed about that, more or less.`
`George approached the window, and looked up at the darkening rainy sky...`
`"...Kanon‐kun is still young, and I think in some ways he tries a little too hard to be mature in his way of thinking."`
`"Uhh, hahahaha...`
` C'mon, quit it already."`
`"Well, umm, it's my fault too, I think part of it was I got sucked in by the atmosphere...`
` And, umm, ...maybe after looking at you two, umm, I got a little jealous, and started feeling a little rushed, there might have been a bit of that, too..."`
`"......Who, who cares about me, anyway?`
` More importantly, how's it going between you two?`
` Looks like it's going pretty good, eh?`
` Eheheh!"`
`"Err, ......I, ...I wonder..."`
`"Yes.`
` It's going very well."`
`Shannon was lost for words, her face red, while George answered brightly and immediately.`
`{n}That carefree attitude made it obvious that their relationship was proceeding so perfectly it would make anyone envious.`
`"Tch, I'm jealous.`
` ......Does that mean Shannon's gonna be resigning and cutting up a cake pretty soon?"`
`"I, I wonder...`
` I don't, umm......"`
`"I wonder, right?`
` How could I know?"`
`George laughed like he was being mean and drew closer to Shannon.`
`{n}...It was probably the way they usually flirted when they were alone.`
`{n}Jessica could only smile awkwardly and say "yes, yes, thank you, that's enough".`
`"I have a dream.`
` It isn't only my ambition to become the leader of my own domain in business.`
` I also have a dream to build a family together with a partner I can spend my life with."`
`"...I want two kids at the very least.`
` And I'd like to do some sports that the whole family could do together.`
` And many more things besides that.`
` I often talk with Shannon about that kind of thing.`
` .........Although every time I talk about that sort of thing, Shannon always laughs and says I'm getting ahead of myself."`
`"...For some reason, even at the age I am now, I already find myself thinking about my retirement and settling down.`
` ......With my healthy grown kids, and grandchildren running around.`
` About how nice it will be to spend my final years at a slow pace, surrounded by that, and together with Shannon forever."`
`"You're definitely getting ahead of yourself.`
` ......But, how should I say it, it sounds like you, George nii‐san."`
`"Being surrounded by a family like that would probably be so wonderful.`
` ......The ideal family that I painted in my mind when I was younger was something like that."`
`...To Shannon, who had been raised in a welfare institute, that harmonious image of a family was probably something she yearned after.`
`......And George, who promised that he would definitely grant that wish for her, was surely a fitting person for her to spend her life with...`
`Shannon was an important friend to Jessica.`
` ......George was surely the one most fit to entrust that friend's future to.`
`"Well, I don't want to throw cold water on you guys,`
` ......but Uncle Hideyoshi aside, what's gonna happen with Auntie Eva?`
` Won't it be tough to convince her?"`
`"........................"`
`"Ahahahaha.`
` There's no reason for anyone to worry about something like that.`
` ......No one can influence my choice of partner.`
` I will make Shannon happy.`
` Whose permission do I need?"`
`"......Whooooa.`
` George nii‐san, that was cool...`
` I can't believe you can say something so embarrassing out loud.`
` I thought you didn't use to be that kind of character."`
`"Leave a boy for three days and you'll hardly recognize him, after all.`
` ......Even I grow up.`
` ...I plan to study more and more, to grow to be a suitable man who can make Shannon happy."`
`It seemed that perhaps George had some kind of awareness of how embarrassing the words coming out of his mouth were.`
` His face turned very slightly red, and he scratched his head.`
`"............George‐san."`
`"It's alright.`
` I'm sure Mother will be difficult, but you can leave that to me.`
` I'll show you that I can make the whole family accept you as my partner."`
`"Awesome...`
` I'm jealous of you Shannon, seriously!"`
`"......I‐if you will go so far,`
` .........then I'm, I'm very grateful..."`
`"Wait a sec, ...I'm starting to feel like a third wheel here.`
` Maybe it's better I leeeeave?"`
`Smiling awkwardly, Jessica stood up from the bed she had been sitting on,`
` and at that very moment, the phone rang.`
`Before Jessica picked up the receiver, wondering what they wanted, Shannon looked at the clock and was taken aback.`
` ......It seemed that she had taken too long on her break.`
`"I, I am sorry...!`
` I forgot it was time for work...!`
` I‐if you will excuse me...!"`
`At the same time that Jessica picked up the phone, Shannon began dashing out of the room.`
`"Ah, Shannon!`
` .........Again, same time, same place."`
`"Ye‐.........yes.`
` ...Ex‐excuse me!"`
`"Hello, it's Jessica.`
` .........Ah, Genji‐san.`
` Yes, Shannon is heading your way as we speak.`
` We held her up, I'm afraid.`
` Please don't scold her.`
` Yes, okay."`
`"I see.`
` So it will be time for dinner to be prepared soon."`
`Many plates were lined up on the counter in the kitchen, and preparations for dinner were proceeding steadily.`
`......The number of plates that were lined up there...`
`......was 19.`
`{n}That number was one more than were lined up during the family conference every year.`
`"I can't accept it...!`
` Why can't I deliver it directly?!"`
`Gohda‐san was flaring up at Genji, paying no heed to the pot that was boiling over.`
`The Master enjoys having his food alone in his study, so the food must be set out in the study.`
` Of course, this is nothing new, you understand.`
`Gohda‐san would really like to set the table for the Master with his own hands, as he puts his heart and soul into his cooking.`
`......But the Master had imposed a strict rule that none but the servants bearing the crest of the Golden Eagle could enter his study.`
`.........So while Gohda‐san could greet the Master from outside the study,`
` not once had he been granted the honor of carrying his cooking into the study.`
`Gohda‐san was always unsatisfied with this.`
`{n}...Of course he knows he is a newcomer in terms of years of service.`
`However, he has accumulated plenty of experience from his previous jobs, and he is strongly confident that he would be able to conduct himself properly, even in front of Kinzo, in a way that would not insult him.`
`And yet, just because he is not permitted the Golden Eagle, he still hasn't been blessed with this honor.`
`......You can probably imagine what damage that has done to his pride.`
` You might think that tonight is a mere resurgence of that old argument, but it isn't.`
`Because tonight, there is a person other than the Master who wants their food carried to their room.`
`Apparently, this person is a very rare and honored guest, and there has been a strict order to treat this person in the same manner as the Master, the family head.`
`Gohda‐san must have wanted to earn some points by serving this honored guest with his own hands.`
`Because he is a person of strong vanity.`
` If he isn't qualified to serve the Master, then at least a guest of the same rank...`
`He simply couldn't make time during lunch, so Kanon‐san had gone for him.`
` ...Therefore, he truly desired to serve tonight's food personally—the best dinner of the year.`
`But Genji‐san had had a problem with that.`
`......Something about how Gohda‐san didn't have the One‐winged Eagle.`
`.........After being once again scolded that he wasn't qualified, Gohda‐san had lost his patience.`
`Ahh, how heartrending, Gohda‐san...`
`I cannot do anything more than watch like this from the shadows...`
`"Kumasawa‐san, if you have enough free time to dawdle around, please prepare the dining hall.`
` Is the tablecloth ready?!"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho... Oh my, my apologies..."`
`When it became her turn to bear the brunt, Kumasawa softly disappeared into the hall.`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is of exactly the same rank as the Master.`
` ......We must respect the same rules that we respect for the Master."`
`"......Gohda, you will devote your attention entirely towards the task you have been given, and attend to the family..."`
`"I don't mind if it's you, Genji‐san, but is it really alright to let a child like this go to such a guest?!`
` If she made some blunder, it would be quite rude."`
`"I know that they have served here for a long time, but it's not as though they have undergone a proper apprenticeship.`
` If you will allow me to speak freely, they do not have the proper grounding to entertain guests!"`
`"........................"`
`Gohda spoke bluntly, even though Shannon was waiting right there in the kitchen.`
`Shannon was the one who Genji had ordered to carry the food to {f:5:Beatrice}'s room.`
` ......By the ranking system among the servants permitted the Golden Eagle, Shannon was indeed the second highest ranked.`
`...If the highest ranked, Genji, went to set the table in Kinzo's room, then it fell to Shannon to set the table in {f:5:Beatrice}'s room.`
`Gohda's pride was always horribly injured when he was confronted with this ranking system.`
` ...In times like that, he would speak out bluntly and rudely about Shannon and Kanon.`
`Gohda kept raising example after example of Shannon's past failures, making a ruckus about how this was wrong and that was wrong.`
`As Shannon listened to this with her head hung in shame, she heard Kanon's voice from behind her.`
`...Kanon had been listening from a blind spot, leaning against the hallway side of the wall near the entrance to the kitchen.`
` ...He probably knew that if he entered the kitchen, sparks would start to fly his way.`
`"............Let him rant.`
` He's a horrible man."`
`"......B‐but, this helps me to build up a grounding on how to entertain someone.`
` ......Gohda‐san has learned a lot, so what he has to say is very..."`
`"Hmph.`
` ......Nee‐san, you sure are nice."`
`"......More importantly,`
` ............is the guest in the VIP room...`
`really {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, as they say?"`
`"...Yes.`
` .........I met her when I was sent to set the table for her during lunch.`
` ...There's no mistake—it's her."`
`"Re‐really?`
` Was she doing well?"`
`"........................"`
`Kanon remembered that he and Shannon had different impressions of {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` To Shannon, {f:5:Beatrice} was a cupid of love, who had granted her magic to create her relationship with George.`
`Judging by her happy expression,`
` ...it looked like she couldn't wait to inform {f:5:Beatrice} of how her relationship with George had progressed.`
`......However, Kanon already knew.`
`{n}That witch had come here with a terrifying goal in mind.`
`......That vague witch, in the past only visible to them, had now walked in openly through the front door,`
` and had revived enough that they could now carry food to her.`
`...In the past, when she had disappeared from in front of Kanon...`
`{n}...the witch had said something about how her own power was still weak.`
`.........Now that the witch could appear openly like this, did that mean that she had finally returned to her former power?`
`And she had said.`
` .........She had said clearly that she had sown the seeds of love with the knowledge that it would fail.`
`She had said also.`
` .........She had said clearly that the day had finally come when the door to the Golden Land would be opened.`
`".........Shannon.`
` ...She will perform some bizarre ritual with the Master, ...and will surely do something unimaginably horrible.`
` ......And no one can resist that."`
`"What are you talking about......?"`
`"She came here...`
`as the Master requested, so that the door to the Golden Land would open, and so that everything would be returned to the Golden Land.`
` She said that to me clearly!"`
`"................................."`
`In the past,`
` ......the two of them, as furniture working for Kinzo, had been told what the opening of the door to the Golden Land meant.`
`Therefore, even without asking a single question in response, Shannon understood everything.`
`{n}.........So, ...she grew deeply hopeless.`
`...Something tore at Kanon's heart as he saw her expression twist with grief...`
`"............How could...`
` .........Why, ...why now............"`
`"......Didn't I tell you?`
` We are furniture!`
` ......Because you acted like a human, because you loved, .........you can't obediently accept the day when our service is over...!"`
`"..................At one time, I used to wish that this day would come.`
` ......But it never came after so much time...`
` ......I didn't know how long we would have to be tormented as furniture...`
` .........So I thought.`
` ...I thought that day of rest wouldn't come for all eternity."`
`".........I thought that too!`
` But I believed that it would definitely come someday!`
` So I never forgot that I am furniture!`
` But Nee‐san, you forgot that!"`
`"..................It's......my fault, isn't it......`
` .........Mine......"`
`"Yeah, it's your fault, Nee‐san.`
` ......If only you hadn't known love...`
` ......We would both be happy that this day has finally come!`
` You built up meaningless attachments!`
` Even though it was a world that you would definitely have to leave!!"`
`"...............Will the ritual...begin tonight...?"`
`"...Yes.`
` ...............Also, she said this to me.`
` ...Tonight, George‐sama will probably give you an engagement ring, Nee‐san."`
`"........................"`
`That was a fact.`
` ......George should have snuck in an engagement ring in his pocket today.`
` ......And surely, he would hand it over tonight.`
`"......She joined you together, planning to use you and George‐sama as the sacrifices for the second twilight.`
` ...Understand?`
` Nee‐san, she took advantage of you by tempting you!"`
`"............So that was it.`
` ......I never thought of that."`
`"But she told me.`
` ...She promised that if you don't accept the engagement ring tonight, she won't choose you as a sacrifice.`
` ............I think that our chances of being able to go to the Golden Land together are very slim."`
`"There will be thirteen people sacrificed.`
` Only five will be left alive.`
` ...The chances of us both being a part of that group are really slim.`
` ......However, if you at least can take advantage of that promise, those chances rise higher!`
` I want to take that bet!"`
`"Our salvation is in the Golden Land.`
` If we can make it that far, we can become human.`
` And I want to walk through life as a human, together with you, Nee‐san...!`
` If we do that, we might even be able to achieve...`
`...true love!"`
`"..............................`
` ...We used to dream about being able to go to the Golden Land, didn't we?`
` .........If we go there, any wish will be granted.`
` .........We will be saved from this pain.`
` ............We believed that."`
`However, in this ritual, only a few people, chosen by fate and chance, would be invited to the Golden Land.`
` ......Everyone else would lose their life as a sacrifice midway through the ceremony.`
`But in the past, Shannon and Kanon had thought...`
`that whether they reached the Golden Land or were made sacrifices, it would be all the same, because they would be released from their duties as furniture either way.`
`......So, in short, the ritual had been something that would definitely grant release to furniture like them.`
`"I don't like it.`
` ......Together with you, I want to take back all the hard times we had.`
` I won't become a sacrifice.`
` You and I will remain alive.`
` And we'll reach the Golden Land together."`
`"............So I won't let you become the sacrifice for the second twilight!`
` Please, Nee‐san!`
` Don't accept that man's ring!`
` If you don't accept it, she promised not to select you as a sacrifice!!"`
`".....................That's......something I can't do.`
` ......Tonight's ring is very special.`
` ......My heart...won't permit me to not accept it."`
`"Nee‐san...!`
` The witch decides the ritual sacrifices arbitrarily!`
` That witch has promised to overlook you at least, Nee‐san!!`
` You at least will definitely be able to go to the Golden Land!"`
`"......Me at least?`
` What about you, Kanon‐kun?"`
`"The witch's game......is enough for me.`
` ...I'll slip through her evil hand.`
` .........I am not powerless.`
` I'll grab that small chance and I won't let go..."`
`"............................................."`
`"After all, our lives are temporary, aren't they?`
` ...In order to begin our real lives,`
` ......let's make it to the Golden Land.`
` And...`
`let's gain our humanity."`
`"...............And then...`
`...maybe, like you, Nee‐san,`
` ......I'll be able to know love.`
` Maybe I won't have to call myself furniture,`
` .........and make people cry anymore......"`
`".........Kanon‐kun............"`
`"I...`
`...don't want to be furniture anymore......!`
` ......I'm gonna...`
`...become human......`
` ...No more pain,`
` ......I'm gonna end it all.........!"`
`"............................................."`
`There were tears in Kanon's eyes...`
`It had taken Kanon until now to notice.`
`{n}......Shannon hadn't been the only one to know and suffer the taste of love.`
`He had too.`
`The tears Jessica had shown him that day,`
` ......and her painful smiles on all the days since as she tried to smooth things over and brighten her mood...`
`had slowly wrought some kind of change on Kanon's heart without him knowing it...`
`".........Shannon!`
` I have been calling you for ages."`
`Shannon snapped to reality at the sudden sound of Genji's voice.`
`{n}Apparently, she had been called for repeatedly.`
`{n}She hurriedly answered.`
`......When she turned around, Kanon had disappeared.`
`{n}......It seemed he didn't feel like showing his tears to anybody...`
`"Ye‐yes.`
` I'm sorry for being distracted..."`
`"I had Kanon handle lunch, but properly speaking, as the next in rank after me, you should have been the one to take it to her.`
` .........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is the most honored guest of this house.`
` There is no more honored guest than her.`
` ......Please think of her as another master of the mansion and be polite."`
`"...I must impress upon you once again—please be very careful not to make any blunders.`
` It is quite painful for me to entrust this to someone inexperienced as yourself, but there's nothing we can do about the house's rules.`
` ......I am sincerely counting on you."`
`Gohda had officially agreed, but he threatened Shannon with an expression that told her that he definitely wouldn't forgive any mistakes.`
`Shannon, too, thought that Gohda should do it if he wanted to that much,`
` ......but considering it as her responsibility as one who had been granted the Golden Eagle, she had to give up.`
`......Besides.`
` ...I wanted to meet {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}What will I talk about?`
` What will I ask?`
` ...I don't know.`
`Will I show gratitude?`
` Or else, grief?`
`{n}Or else, ...what?`
` ...I don't know.`
`Shannon loaded the witch's food onto the serving cart, and left the kitchen with a slow gait...`
`The person knocking was Krauss.`
`"Father.`
` Today is our annual family conference.`
` Haven't the siblings gathered here to get a glance of you, Father?"`
`"Aaah, be silent!!`
` I have told you I won't leave!`
` I imagine that you are there, Genji!!`
` Why haven't you had my food brought here as I ordered you to?!!"`
`Kinzo screamed through the door.`
`{n}...Genji was waiting behind Krauss.`
`"......Your meal has been prepared so that it may be carried to the study.`
` ...However, Krauss‐sama wishes for you to go downstairs tonight..."`
`"Father.`
` I don't mean every day.`
` Even if it's just for tonight, won't you gather together with your family?"`
`"Who are you calling family!!`
` When did you start calling those vultures who wait for me to collapse and die family?!`
` When did you start calling rotting, gushing maggots FAMILY?!!"`
`"...........................`
` ...My, my."`
`Krauss shrugged at this answer which he had half‐expected.`
`"Genji, carry the meal here as you were told!!`
` Why don't you listen to what I say?!!`
` Why?!`
` WHY?!!"`
`"......Genji‐san.`
` I will leave the rest to you.`
` ...My voice will no longer reach him."`
`Krauss gave his head a small shake, and quickly turned his back on the door to the study.`
`......He had only called out for his siblings' sake, knowing it was useless.`
`After Genji watched Krauss go down the stairs, he called again through the door.`
`"...My lord.`
` We have finished preparations for the meal to be carried here.`
` .........What about the serving for Doctor Nanjo?"`
`Nanjo was also in the study.`
` Because Kinzo had strongly pestered him about resolving their long‐lasting chess game, Nanjo had been Kinzo's opponent since before evening.`
`Nanjo had announced as a doctor that Kinzo's days were numbered.`
`{n}...In that situation, if Kinzo pestered him about finishing a chess game while he was still alive, Nanjo couldn't refuse.`
`Kinzo was thinking deeply about his move, concentrating more than usual.`
` ......It had been Kinzo's turn for quite some time, and Nanjo, who was tired of waiting, had started randomly pulling out grimoires that he couldn't understand and skimming through them.`
`".........Kinzo‐san.`
` You won't think of a good move just by folding your arms and sitting in front of the board.`
` I wonder if it wouldn't be good to take a break and refresh our minds...?"`
`"Be silent.`
` ......Hmmm.`
` ......That should be good enough for defense.`
` Will that hole be penetrated by the bishop or the knight...?`
` ............nnnnnnnn..."`
`Today, Kinzo was insistent on a strong defense.`
`......Normally, Kinzo's motto was that offense was the best defense.`
` However, today was completely the opposite.`
`"............I am also hungry.`
` Shall we suspend the game here?`
` And I've used my head so much without a break that I'm already feeling dizzy.`
` ......Any more of this might limit my ability to make my best moves."`
`"...That is a problem.`
` ............In chess, both players must always make their best moves.`
` ...Other moves are painful to understand, and ruin a game that is about reading thoughts.`
` ...That considerably reduces our enjoyment."`
`Kinzo sighed deeply, and finally shifted his gaze away from the board.`
`Chess needs an opponent.`
` ...That opponent was tired and suggesting to suspend the game, so what else could be done...`
`"It is true that the goal of chess is for both players to aim for victory and make the best moves possible in order to achieve that.`
` ...It is an intellectual game of being able to read each other."`
`"......But Kinzo‐san, are you forgetting that there is another goal separate from victory?"`
`"............What?`
` What goal could there be other than victory?"`
`"Hahahaha......`
` It surprises me you would forget even that.`
` ...Through chess, you get to spend some fun time with your friend,`
` you see."`
`"Ah,`
` ......you got me.`
` I believe those are words I said to you a long time ago.`
` ............I shall have to concede that."`
`Kinzo, who normally wore a frown, surprisingly relaxed his face and laughed.`
` ...Nanjo felt like he had been reunited with a close friend he hadn't seen in a long time.`
`"That's how it is.`
` Now that I've taken a shot back at you, what do you think?`
` Will you go down to eat with me?`
` What do you say about discussing Kasparov's middlegame over some coffee?"`
`".................................`
` ...A good plan, but I will refrain.`
` ......I can no longer leave this room.`
` ...Because the ritual has begun."`
`"............Is that so?`
` Well, my stomach is growling.`
` ...I will go downstairs.`
` Any time you feel like it—"`
`"Nanjo.`
` ............Thank you."`
`"......Oh, what could you be thanking me for?"`
`"...We didn't resolve our chess match.`
` ......However, it seems that I have succeeded in that goal of chess which I forgot.`
` It seems that was just as important as checkmate."`
`"This isn't like you.`
` Why so sentimental?"`
`".........You said it, didn't you?`
` My days are numbered.`
` ......Now, go.`
` And don't come to this room again.`
` ......We shall continue in the Golden Land."`
`"..............................`
` ...That is fine, but it shall be a rematch.`
` Losing that rook was a serious blow."`
`"......Well then, I will see you later."`
`"Yes, later.`
` ............Maybe in the Golden Land, or in Purgatory.`
` Or in the next world."`
`"..........................."`
`Nanjo didn't say anything beyond that.`
` And with a practiced hand, he pushed the button on the table that would release the auto‐lock.`
`Then, after looking at Kinzo's back one last time, he left the study.`
`As he did, Genji's voice came from the hall.`
`"......Well then, my lord.`
` I will now carry in your dinner."`
`"It may be my last supper.`
` I must savor it.`
` ......Please, get it ready."`
`"Certainly.`
` ............Are your own preparations in order, my lord?"`
`"...Indeed.`
` I have spent my time until today wrapping this room in a multitude of rigorous barriers.`
` .........Even if that roulette chooses me, I will definitely repel it.`
` ...I will remain alive, and I will definitely become one of those who reach the Golden Land...!`
` ......I will reject the visitations of the gods of death who try to drag me off to Hades..."`
`".........Excuse me.`
` ...I have come to prepare your meal."`
`Shannon entered the VIP room, bowing her head and pushing the serving cart.`
`The young woman by the window, apparently gazing out into the impenetrable darkness outside, was unmistakably that witch.`
`"So it is Shannon this time.`
` How nostalgic.`
` .........Hoh.`
` Your countenance has improved quite considerably, has it not?`
` Unlike Kanon.`
` Almost beyond recognition."`
`".........Thank you very much."`
`Shannon solemnly prepared dinner.`
`...There were actually several things that she wanted to ask and talk with the witch about.`
` ...But those things were all jumbled up, and she didn't know where to start.`
`Her heart was also jumbled up with various things, and she didn't even understand her own emotions.`
` ...Therefore, still remaining vague, all she could do was to carry out her work indifferently.`
`However, the witch guessed what was in her heart.`
`{n}You can't hide things from a witch...`
`"...............I won't apologize.`
` Because I am a witch."`
`"......For what?"`
`"Come.`
` ...Kanon must have told you about it.`
` Helping out your love life was simply my mischievous spirit.`
` ......It was nothing more than a seed I sowed in order to enjoy witnessing in what manner things would get complicated, become twisted, and fail."`
`".........There are some who think it is more fun to hear about love than to have it."`
`"Surely, .........you aren't trying to thank me?"`
`"...Yes, I am.`
` ......No matter what kind of ulterior motive you had when you gave me the magic of love,`
` ......it doesn't change the fact that you gave it to me."`
`".........So even if you sowed that seed knowing that the two of us wouldn't be able to stay together for life,`
` ...I won't hold a grudge against you."`
`"............Hmmmm.`
` ......Furniture truly is uninteresting.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` Cooking it into something interesting is where my skill shines."`
`"......I don't understand how you think, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` ......You are a Great Witch, and people like us don't even reach your feet,`
` ...nor can we even imagine your grand thoughts.`
` But there is at least one thing I can say."`
`"......What is it?"`
`"Thank you for teaching me to be human.`
` .........You said it yourself.`
` ...I am no longer furniture."`
`"...............Silence, furniture.`
` ...If you were a true human, hearing the announcement of your death on the day that you were to receive an engagement ring should have you dancing around mad with grief."`
`"But what of you?`
` Your face looks enlightened, as though you have accepted everything!`
` ......Truly an anticlimax. Furniture...!"`
`"No.`
` I am not furniture."`
`"Silence, furniture."`
`"I won't be silent.`
` Because I am not furniture."`
`"Are you saying you won't listen to my orders?"`
`"Furniture obeys orders.`
` ...But a human decides for herself whether to obey orders or not.`
` {i:So I won't obey your orders.}"`
`"Hmph.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle* hahahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!`
` ......I'll take back what I said.`
` You really are interesting."`
`"......If I hadn't sowed those seeds, you probably would have allowed the ritual to control your fate without any emotion at all.`
` ......But now you have grown to be truly interesting, and you entertain me from the bottom of my heart.`
` That is fine.`
` Because I have no love for boredom.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`".........I have finished preparations for dinner.`
` ...Here you go."`
`"Hmm.`
` ...Doesn't this look delicious.`
` .........If Gohda makes it to the Golden Land, it may be desirable to commission him as my chief cook."`
`"......I heard from Kanon‐kun.`
` .........Something about, if I rejected George‐san's proposal, you promised not to make me a sacrifice."`
`"Mm.`
` I did.`
` ......Although you were an ideal sacrifice for the second twilight.`
` ...Kanon cried and screamed that I should pardon you of that, so I graciously listened to his words.`
` With the condition that you give up your engagement.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*, how gracious I am."`
`"............What a foolish condition.`
` And what a foolish threat.`
` ......You bullied Kanon‐kun thoroughly using that, I suppose?"`
`"Hoh.`
` So you can tell.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`Apparently, Shannon had seen through it.`
` ......Apparently, she could imagine how much Kanon had been bullied and humiliated by the witch, with that horrible promise as bait.`
`"I made him crawl on the carpet and kiss my shoes.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` And that's not all.`
` ......Do you want to hear the other ways in which I humiliated him...?"`
`Shannon silently shook her head.`
`"I have finally come to understand you.`
` You like to bully, confuse, and trouble people, and you do it to entertain yourself.`
` .........So I'm now sure that this is the only way to resist you."`
`"What is?"`
`"I will have nothing to do with you.`
` ...I will carry out the fate that has been given to me.`
` So I won't entertain you."`
`"......{i:Nothing to do with youuu}...?"`
`The witch's features twisted in hatred for just an instant.`
`...It disappeared immediately,`
` but that expression that rose to her face for only a brief time was unusual for the witch, who had never broken her malicious smile.`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` ...I suppose that's one way to resist?`
` Interesting.`
` I like it.`
` I'll kill you.`
` Together with your lover...!"`
`"...If that is the fate that you have decided, that is up to you.`
` ......I won't be afraid of that or go against that.`
` Because I don't believe that the grim fate that will start occurring now is something controlled by your will."`
`"We humans don't know anything about our possible future fates.`
` That is how we live to the fullest, following our own beliefs and destinies until the last.`
` Fate is just a roll of the dice.`
` You can't feel malice in it.`
` Try as you might to inject some, I won't believe you."`
`"......Hoh.`
` Even though you have stopped being furniture, you have no fear of death.`
` ......It seems you think that will bore me, but that's a huge misunderstanding.`
` ...I am now all the more interested to see whether you really can stick to that until your last moments.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"It's so frustrating.`
` ......Why did you take the form of a human, appear in front of us, speak with human words, and ridicule us?`
` ...If you hadn't appeared in front of us, if you hadn't predicted the future,`
` ......we would have been able to live life to the fullest until the last moment."`
`"That's what witches do.`
` We live off your fates, reigning as a high‐order being does over low‐order beings.`
` After all, your fates are merely fragments.`
` If we cup our hands together, we can scoop out as many as we want."`
`"......In the same way that the beef cattle I raise can babble what they will, and it won't change the fact that they will add splendor to my dinner table.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"......We are powerless, so we can't go against your ritual or our fates.`
` ...But I can do something that will make you unhappy right now."`
`"Hoh.`
` What would that be?"`
`".........I will walk away from this place right now.`
` Answering your words only entertains you.`
` Not answering your questions is the only way I can resist you."`
`"I see, I see.`
` You may be able to take a shot at me.`
` ...But you cannot defeat me, you know?`
` ......I have the power to kill anyone for eternity."`
`".........I can't wait to see how long you can keep up that resistance in an endlessly repeating cycle of death and rebirth.`
` ......{i:Don't forget it, now}.`
` You spoke those words yourself.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`"Well then, if you will excuse me.`
` If you have any business, please call me."`
`Shannon gave a reserved bow as she would to a stranger, and faced away.`
`{n}...With that gesture, maybe she really had taken a shot back at the witch, just as {f:5:Beatrice} had mentioned.`
`...Because when the witch called out again, she sounded a little more quick‐tempered than she had before.`
`"Kanon thanked me.`
` ...Aren't you going to?`
` Not going to thank me for giving you your day of rest?"`
`"Furniture will be happy about their day of rest.`
` But I am a human, you see.`
` So I have nothing to thank you for.`
` ......Will that be all?"`
`".........You plan to receive the ring from George?`
` Don't forget that if you do, I will abandon the promise I made with Kanon, the promise that you would not be selected as a sacrifice."`
`"If there is anything further, I'll have someone else come for you.`
` If you will excuse me."`
`A flat‐out interruption.`
`{n}Shannon gave no more answers.`
`And the sound of the door closing came instead of an answer.`
`It seemed that Shannon's resistance had probably struck far more deeply into the witch than Shannon herself had thought.`
`...Because an expression of hatred had once again risen to {f:5:Beatrice}'s face.`
`She had made Kanon submit, even though he hadn't been taken in until the end.`
` ...Yet after that, now it was Shannon who refused to submit, when until now she had been easily taken in.`
`"...............Oh?`
` ...This is interesting after all!`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` ...I suppose I'm not so old yet.`
` This is why I'm still not tired of living after one thousand years..."`
`The most fabulous time in the family conference.`
`{n}That was the dinner.`
`Back when Kinzo had been serious about the family conference, he had placed extreme importance upon this dinner, for which everyone would gather just once a year.`
`Should the dinner not meet standards, he would take it as the deepest shame for himself as the host,`
` and he had strongly ordered Natsuhi to make absolutely sure that it was one to be proud of.`
`Because of that, she and Krauss had employed Gohda, who had confidence in his cooking abilities.`
`......As a result, they could unveil a wonderful dinner they had confidence in,`
` yet by that time, Kinzo had started closing himself up in his study and no longer appeared for dinner—maybe you could call that ironic...`
`When the main dish for tonight, calf steak, was set out, Gohda began to brag about it, further exciting everyone's appetite.`
`"The sauce here is Bordelaise."`
`"Of course, the red wine base I used was excellent even among those made in Bordeaux, but in addition, I prepared an original blend of this house,`
` a blend of choice alcohols from around the world to further deepen the taste."`
`"This sauce will be exclusive to this year.`
` It would greatly please me if you were to enjoy yourselves."`
`"...Isn't that wonderful?`
` However, isn't Bordelaise sauce common to French cooking?`
` It almost seems like using alcohol from outside France with that is heresy."`
`"Krauss‐sama.`
` Today is the annual family conference."`
`"As a dinner for those who normally live far away, and have traveled far from across the world to gather together,`
` I realized that a sauce made from a blend of fine alcohols from across the world that would normally never meet would be most fitting,`
` so I had it specially prepared."`
`"Wonderful!`
` A truly wonderful cook, that's what you are!`
` Food and medicine work twice as well if you advertise it right!`
` It's twice as delicious as normal food, and the advertisin' makes that twice as good again.`
` The taste keeps doublin' and doublin'!`
` Wahahahahaha!"`
`"*giggle*.`
` Come on, Nii‐san.`
` Didn't he see that question coming?"`
`"No doubt.`
` You let Gohda‐san run right off with your moment."`
`"Is that so?`
` I just thought there might be some people here who didn't notice that today's food was in the French style."`
`"......Just now, Eva said that not using butter was a virtue, but that's the Spanish style.`
` ...Well, I guess they do share a border, right?"`
`"...That's not what I meant.`
` Will you please not take a part of the conversation out of context and misquote me?"`
`"...It's a very delicious sauce.`
` Gohda‐san, you certainly are wonderful."`
`"It is a great honor to receive your praise.`
` And this is all thanks to Madam's habitual guidance."`
`"......No, it was all Gohda's idea.`
` I only listened to the recipe and approved of it."`
`It looked like the siblings quickly got into a loud argument about something as trivial as the sauce,`
` ...but for the most part, dinner proceeded peacefully.`
`......However, the thing that they all really wanted to ask about smoldered inside each of their hearts.`
`......And that was the visitor, the 19th person.`
`{n}............The Golden Witch.`
`In actuality, Eva, Rudolf, and Kyrie were on alert during dinner.`
`If the mystery guest was to be introduced, this dinner table was the most appropriate place to do it.`
` ...However, no plates had been prepared at the table for the witch.`
`The family conference would begin in earnest after the meal, and previous experiences told them that it could last until deep into the night.`
`......But they couldn't understand what meaning there could be in keeping this person, who should be introduced, hidden until late at night.`
`So Eva, Rudolf, and Kyrie had started to suspect something.`
`......That the guest might actually be unknown to Krauss as well.`
`If she wasn't a saboteur called by Krauss to give him an advantage in the inheritance problem,`
` ...they should probably speak frankly to Krauss beforehand, and create a common front to resist anything disadvantageous to the four siblings.`
`......If she was Kinzo's saboteur,`
` whose purpose was to keep the inheritance from being handed over to the four siblings,`
` the enmity between Krauss and the other siblings could become nothing more than a weak point that benefitted the enemy...`
`"Well then, please enjoy at your leisure..."`
`With the table set and the cuisine explained, Gohda tried to leave the room, but Kyrie called him to a stop with a small voice.`
`"......Yes, Kyrie‐sama.`
` What is it?"`
`"Umm, I'm sorry.`
` ......I thought there was a guest here today—will we not be seeing her at dinner...?"`
`She had thought she'd said it nonchalantly, but unfortunately, it reached the ears of Natsuhi, who was sitting in the next seat.`
`It seemed that Natsuhi had heard it to mean "even though there are guests here today, won't the host be coming to dinner?"`
` ......In other words, that Kyrie had asked whether Kinzo was going to come to dinner.`
`"The head's condition is not good, so he said that he will take his dinner in his study.`
` ......My husband explained that in the beginning; is something...?"`
`"..................I'm sorry.`
` That's not what I meant."`
`...In an instant, Kyrie realized from Natsuhi's reaction that this unknown visitor was also unknown to Krauss and his wife.`
`.........And what that meant...`
` ......On the chessboard placed inside Kyrie's mind, she could feel the arrangement of the pieces changing, making loud clattering sounds...`
`"A guessst?"`
`It seemed that Battler, who was sitting next to Natsuhi, had heard Kyrie's words without misunderstanding them,`
` and he let out a wild voice, questioning who else could have been invited to today's family conference.`
`Thanks to that voice, the uncomfortable feeling in the siblings' chests suddenly exploded...`
`Everyone looked at Gohda at the same time.`
`......Judging by their appearances, it was obvious that at least no one here had invited that mystery woman.`
`For an instant, Gohda was startled to find everyone's gaze gathered on him, but because of his naturally vain personality, this actually gave him a feeling of superiority.`
`Therefore, he answered in an extremely calm and graceful manner.`
`"......Yes.`
` She wanted to eat alone in the VIP room, so her food was carried over there."`
`Therefore, Gohda's extremely graceful and reasonable response made it obvious to everyone that a 19th person, a visitor, existed...`
`"The VIP room? A guest?`
` ......What and who are you talking about?"`
`Natsuhi's words echoed the question that everyone who didn't know about the visit of the Golden Witch was thinking.`
`Gohda was slightly disoriented, as though he hadn't remotely expected to be questioned by Natsuhi.`
`......That honored guest had been spoken of so stringently.`
`{n}He hadn't imagined that Krauss and his wife might not have known.`
`"Umm, ......it is {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` See, see!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} came, uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`Maria had been telling the other cousins over and over again that she had met {f:5:Beatrice} today.`
`......The cousins had answered, saying "Isn't that nice", but they hadn't believed.`
` So, ...their eyes grew wide.`
`"S‐sorry.`
` I was sure you were just joking, Maria...`
` S‐so, she really does exist..."`
`".........By {f:5:Beatrice}, ......you mean that {f:5:Beatrice} of the gold...?!"`
`"Uu!!`
` I've been saying she "exists" the whole time!`
` No one believed!!"`
`"Sorry, Maria‐chan...`
` We didn't mean to..."`
`After learning that everyone had doubted {f:5:Beatrice}'s existence, Maria, who had been in a good mood all day, completely lost her temper.`
`...George, who was sitting next to her, tried frantically to calm her.`
`"...Gohda.`
` Is that another bit of dinner entertainment?`
` *cackle*, quite a good performance."`
`".........Aniki.`
` Drop the act.`
` ...You called her, right?"`
`"Called?`
` Called who?`
` ...From where?!"`
`"Nii‐san.`
` Let's have a clear answer.`
` ......Who is that?`
` Surely you aren't going to tell us that it really is the {f:5:Beatrice} from that portrait, right?"`
`"I don't have a clue what you people are talking about!`
` Gohda, is this seriously not a joke?!"`
`"I, I, umm......`
` I was just ordered by Genji‐san, umm...!"`
`"Call Genji.`
` Now!!"`
`When Natsuhi yelled, Gohda shot out into the hallway.`
`The sound of the door being thrown open at that time triggered a sudden uproar around the dinner table.`
`"So you say you don't know either, Aniki?`
` Who called her?`
` Was it Dad?!"`
`"......I don't know anything about this.`
` It seems that you people believe that I have been pulling the strings behind the scenes, but that is a huge misunderstanding."`
`"Calm down, Krauss nii‐san.`
` We aren't at the stage where we can sound each other out anymore.`
` If you're sayin' that you don't know this mystery person either, this situation becomes ridiculous...!"`
`"Hideyoshi‐san, won't you be a little more discreet with your words?`
` My husband would not invite unnecessary people to the family conference."`
`"Honestly.`
` What are you people talking about?`
` Are you saying that the witch of the portrait has broken out of her frame and appeared?!`
` ......There's no way anyone has actually met this witch."`
`"I...met her...!"`
`Eva and Rudolf nodded at Rosa's proclamation.`
`"Uu!`
` I met her too!!`
` Uncle Krauss, belieeeve!`
` Believe Mama!`
` Uu‐uu!"`
`The brief tension was broken, and Maria also started to make a ruckus.`
`{n}...The room was by now chaotic.`
`"I don't have a clue what's going on...`
` So what's going on?`
` The witch who gave Grandfather the gold is appearing as a special guest in this year's family conference...?!"`
`"But... Really...?`
` Auntie Rosa didn't see it wrong, did she...?"`
`"I met her toooooo!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`"Auntie Rosa, ......are you...sure?"`
`"............Yes.`
` .........Maria and I met her, ......and even talked to her."`
`"......I met her!!`
` That was definitely a witch...!`
` Believe me!!`
` I definitely didn't see it wrong or hallucinate or anything!`
` What.........{i:was} that?!"`
`...In the instant before the typhoon visited...`
`{n}......Rosa had definitely met with the witch in the rose garden.`
`But that scene had been so hard to accept as reality......`
`and the more she spoke of it like this, the less she understood what it was she had met.`
`Ironically, because she had lost her composure when she said that she had definitely met the witch,`
` the more desperate she became, the more vague the witch's existence seemed.`
`So, it was a single composed sentence that affirmed her existence for certain.`
`".........I met her as well.`
` We exchanged greetings—well, they could hardly be called that—a few words, at least.`
` .........It's definitely not something that Rosa‐san saw wrong."`
`"Kyrie‐san, are you serious...?"`
`"Yes.`
` .........But she didn't tell me her name.`
` So I can't conclude that she was {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......However, sorry if this is subjective,`
` ......but since I met her in the entrance hall, I was able to compare her face with the portrait.`
` ...My first impression was that she was undoubtedly the portrait's subject.`
` .........This is all just subjective, remember."`
`"That isn't possible!`
` In the first place, where did that woman come from?`
` The only boat today was the round‐trip journey of the one that escorted you all here.`
` Was she riding on that boat?!"`
`".....................`
` I admit, that's a bit of a weak spot.`
` Of course, I have no memory of such a woman getting off the boat with us."`
`"Ooh, is it really?`
` How can you prove that there wasn't a boat other than the one we rode on?`
` You can't!`
` You can't prove one "{i:didn't come}"!"`
`"That's right.`
` ......You could prove that it "came".`
` Someone who saw it just has to say so.`
` But you can't prove that it "didn't come"."`
`"Even if everyone says that it didn't come—that they didn't see it—you can't deny that it could have "come secretly".`
` It's that thing they call the "Devil's Proof"."`
`It's easy to prove that a devil "exists".`
`{n}All you have to do is meet a devil.`
`{n}But it is impossible to prove that devils "don't exist".`
`Just because no one has ever met a devil doesn't mean that you can deny the possibility that they're hiding away somewhere that humans cannot go.`
`......You can't deny the existence of aliens for exactly the same reasons.`
`Until humanity searches the whole of space and can show perfectly that aliens don't exist, you can't be sure that they don't.`
`And it's definitely impossible for us to ever check the entirety of space for the existence of aliens.`
`...Therefore, while there may be a number of ways to prove that aliens do exist, it is impossible to show proof that denies their existence.`
`"......In that case, we would just be wasting our time discussing whether or not a boat separate from the one we rode on came to the island.`
` ......She wasn't on the boat with us.`
` That much is a fact, and she must have visited this island through some other means."`
`"That's right.`
` There may be no need to discuss how she came here.`
` The essential point is the fact that she actually is in this mansion now, and doesn't feel like having dinner with us."`
`"Let's review.`
` ...Right now, there is another guest on this island other than the 18 of the Ushiromiya family.`
` And that is a guest that even Aniki and Natsuhi nee‐san don't know about, right?"`
`"I don't know...!`
` I don't know what you're talking about...!"`
`"Be silent for a while.`
` Your headache will get worse.`
` ......It is as my wife says.`
` I have no idea what you people have been talking about up until now."`
`"Then there can be only one answer.`
` ......Father called her.`
` For today's family conference!"`
`"For the family conference?!`
` Then for what reason?!"`
`"I don't know that!`
` I thought you knew, Nii‐san, that's why I thought I'd question you!"`
`"Eva, could you give it a rest?!`
` Krauss nii‐san said that he doesn't know!`
` ......So this is what we've got.`
` Father stealthily invited the witch of the portrait as a secret guest.`
` And Rosa‐san met her, Maria‐chan met her, and Kyrie‐san met her too."`
`".........That's all we know for now!`
` If she has something to say to us, she could just quickly show herself!`
` So what I want to know is why in blazes she's shut herself up without greetin' us."`
`"You think maybe Dad never had any interest in the family conference from the beginning, and just secretly called a new mistress here?`
` And had her dress up as his ideal witch?`
` ............Nah, this day holds too much significance to come to that conclusion."`
`"There can be only one reason.`
` To join in on the family conference.`
` ...She wants to claim some right to Father's inheritance!"`
`"Preposterous!!`
` The head would never have something as filthy as a mistress!"`
`"I told you to be silent!`
` I've been in this mansion with Father for considerable time, and I haven't heard about this once."`
`".........Let me humor you as best as I can...`
` ......You say Father had a hidden child with a mistress of several decades past,`
` ......and Father searched her out and called her here today.`
` ...Is that what you want to say?"`
`"Dear!`
` Father would never have something like that!`
` To waste the noble blood of the Ushiromiya family on a mistress...!`
` This is nothing more than a few people saying that they saw something!`
` It's obviously a fantasy, a delusion, a daydream!`
` Or are you all taking part in some kind of act to entrap my husband?!"`
`"What act?!!`
` If anyone is acting, it's you!!"`
`"Quit it, Aneki.`
` ......She said it in a slightly reckless way, but Natsuhi‐san is correct.`
` Kyrie saw her, but I did not.`
` Neither did you, Aneki.`
` But Rosa did."`
`"......However, that means that she "exists".`
` Because there is someone who can prove that she "exists", we directly conclude that she exists.`
` It's the opposite pattern of the Devil's Proof."`
`".........And I want to meet her too.`
` And I want to ask her directly what kind of business she has with the Ushiromiya family."`
`"I agree with you on that.`
` I truly wish to enquire as to what business she has on Rokkenjima."`
`"Don't act like you don't know!`
` She is after one thing.`
` It's Father's inheritance!`
` We should form a forward‐looking strategy with a lawyer knowledgeable about inheritance issues.`
` If the mistress claims the same rights as Mother, then our shares will be cut right in half!"`
`".........Wai‐wait a second, everybody!`
` Genji‐san will come very soon.`
` He knows everything.`
` I'm sure he will answer our questions!`
` Until then, let's stop talking about this!!"`
`"Come on now, kids!`
` Sorry, but we adults have to start talking about something a little complicated!`
` Go back to the guesthouse!!"`
`Rosa yelled at the children, slightly emotionally.`
`The children didn't understand why they were suddenly being yelled at now, but Eva and the rest came to the same realization as Rosa after a delay.`
`They were talking so grandly about the filthy topic of the inheritance in front of the children.`
`...There was no way that they'd want their children to remain here.`
`{n}So they all immediately agreed with Rosa's plan.`
`"Tha‐that's right, just as Rosa‐san says!`
` George!`
` Take all the cousins and go back to the guesthouse!`
` You all play nice together, you hear?!"`
`"George, do as you're told.`
` Take all of the cousins, and leave right now!"`
`"Wa‐...wait a second, Mother...!`
` We haven't even finished eating yet...!"`
`"Uu!`
` And we still haven't had desserrrrt!!`
` Uuu!!"`
`"We will have Gohda‐san carry dessert to the guesthouse!`
` So leave!!"`
`"Jessica.`
` From here on, the adults will be talking together.`
` Go."`
`".........Fi‐...fine.`
` .........Even though it's only half‐eaten..."`
`"...So I guess I'm not going to be the only exception."`
`"Thank you for understanding, Battler‐kun.`
` ...But you're lucky, you know."`
`"Huh?`
` Why?"`
`"I'd want to leave if I could."`
`"...Ihihihi!`
` I bet you would.`
` I'll let you adults enjoy your happy family chat about the inheritance."`
`"............I will also leave my seat.`
` It appears that I have no place here tonight."`
`Nanjo softly rose from his seat.`
`...He had been calmly watching the whole discussion from his seat at the farthest corner of the table, without pointlessly interrupting.`
` ......His reaction was very adult, like a calm old gentleman.`
`When Nanjo rose from his seat, it urged on the other people who were supposed to leave.`
`As the children noisily rose from their seats, a commotion was heard in the hallway as the servants returned.`
`"I apologize for taking so long...`
` I have called Genji..."`
`"......I was checking to see that all of the doors and windows were shut, so it took me some time.`
` My apologies."`
`"Come on! Children, to the guesthouse!`
` Gohda‐san, I'm very sorry, but could you carry the desserts for the children to the guesthouse?"`
`"I see...`
` ...Is that what you wish...?"`
`It seemed that Gohda did not appreciate that the dinner he had worked so hard on was going to be interrupted like this.`
`...He sent Natsuhi a look as though asking her whether that was really alright.`
`"Do as Rosa‐san says.`
` Also, it will not be necessary to set out dessert for us.`
` Be sure not to approach the dining hall until we call you.`
` Tell that to the rest of the servants too.`
` Understood?"`
`"Ye‐...yes.`
` Certainly..."`
`"Come, everyone.`
` Shall we go?`
` Maria‐san, you too, you must not trouble your mother any further."`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` I wanna talk about Beato!!`
` No no no, uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`"Maria‐chan,`
` will you tell us about {f:5:Beatrice} in the guesthouse?`
` ...I really want to hear about the witch.`
` Okay?"`
`"Uu?`
` Uu!"`
`"......You're really good, George nii‐san.`
` I'm impressed."`
`"Are you sure you don't have kids?`
` You're too used to this, ihihi!"`
`Maria's mood was completely back to normal at George's words, and she even took the initiative in hurrying everyone to go to the guesthouse.`
`It looked like Gohda didn't like being kicked out himself, but he was unable to disobey Natsuhi, and left the room with Battler and the rest, closing the door...`
`"......Do you all have some business with me?"`
`"Yes, we do.`
` A bunch of it.`
` And that goes for all of us.`
` So much that we almost want to draw lots to see who asks the first question."`
`"Though I believe that no matter who draws the winning lot, the first question would be the same."`
`"No doubt.`
` .........Genji‐san.`
` Answer us honestly.`
` ...This woman called {f:5:Beatrice} in the VIP room right now... Who is she?"`
`...Hideyoshi's claim that advertising doubled the taste was apparently right.`
`The kids and Nanjo, who had been chased out to the guesthouse, had gathered in the cousins' room,`
` and were eating the cake that Kumasawa had brought there for dessert.`
`It was both wonderful and high‐class, with lavish amounts of cream and decorated deliciously with fruits,`
` but even though it was delicious, for some reason it didn't taste quite as good...`
`"Haha, without Gohda‐san's advertising, it doesn't taste nearly as good."`
`"And good frickin' luck asking Kumasawa baa‐chan for advertising, she'll just say it's made out of mackerel."`
`"Uu?!`
` Really?!`
` You can make cake from mackerel?!"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` Oh, goodness, yes, this cake too, if you mix the squeezed juice of a mackerel in with the flour and eggs and bake it up, it comes out all fluffy.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho."`
`"That would be incredible if true.`
` Maybe mackerel cake will show up on the new menu at Father's stores."`
`"Wahahaha!`
` Because mackerel is full of nutrients and has a healthy image.`
` It could be really popular with women and old people!`
` But I'm not gonna get anywhere near it!"`
`"Girls won't eat something that weird."`
`"Even old people would wish to decline."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!`
` But it's delicious!"`
`Kumasawa was really raising the mood with the mackerel jokes that were her specialty.`
` ...But the sound of the downpouring rain invariably focused their concern on the mystery guest.`
`In the end, they ended up showering Maria with questions again, since she was the only person here to have met {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`".........I never believed...that story was true."`
`"From the way you say that, it sounds like this wasn't the first time you heard that Maria was meeting a witch, even if you didn't believe it."`
`"...Yeah.`
` I thought it was a pretty typical fairy tale for people of that imaginative age."`
`"Exiiists!!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} "exiiists"!`
` Every year when we come to the family conference, I see her and we play together!"`
`"That's right.`
` Although {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama doesn't usually show herself,`
` I hear that she sometimes unexpectedly appears before honest people with clean hearts, to play pranks.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐ho."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} was a name which referred to the being in that fairy tale about the Rokkenjima witch.`
`Because the family and the servants publicly accepted the image of the witch of Kinzo's delusions to keep him in a good mood,`
` it became established as Rokkenjima's fairy tale, or maybe ghost story...`
`To the family members who knew that history, the fairy tale of the Golden Witch didn't have much substance.`
` ...However, they hadn't been able to say that in front of Kinzo.`
`So to those who didn't know the history,`
` ...like young Maria, for example, it definitely wasn't unsubstantial, ...but a real legend of a witch.`
`So Maria believed in the legend of the witch.`
` She swallowed it whole.`
`...That was natural for an imaginative girl who believed in witches.`
`So no one said anything to betray her dream.`
`{n}...On the contrary, they arranged things together to get her excited about her dreams.`
`"...So even on those times when Maria‐chan showed off candy and said that {f:5:Beatrice} had given it to her,`
` ...I thought that somebody had probably slipped a candy into Maria‐chan's handbag or something to create that impression."`
`"............I have also put on such performances on a few occasions in the past,`
` secretly placing sweets somewhere for her.`
` ...Probably, Kumasawa‐san too—no—I expect all of the servants and all of the Ushiromiya family have done it once or twice."`
`"......So, if it will make a small, innocent kid happy, you sometimes plan it together and place some sweets somewhere.`
` ......In that case, I'll bet you do that kind of thing all the time, right, George‐aniki?"`
`"............Who knows."`
`Admitting that would probably be unrefined.`
`George admitted it while being extremely wary that Maria didn't find out.`
`"In other words, ......it's kinda like Santa Claus.`
` To protect a kid's dreams, the parents plot together and lie, setting presents at the bedside of a child fast asleep."`
`"......I mean, you do want to protect kids' dreams.`
` ...As for me, I obviously found out that Santa didn't exist a long time ago.`
` ......But if it was okay not to wake from that dream, I'd have liked to have believed it my whole life."`
`"...Because they know that the world is tough,`
` ...adults want to at least protect a child's untainted dreams."`
`"Uu!!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} exists!`
` "Exiiiists"!!!"`
`"Oh, goodness, certainly.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama does exist, you know?`
` Some time ago, when I was drying mackerel to make some black tea, all of a sudden—"`
`"......Well, that's basically how it went.`
` ...Or at least, how we thought it went."`
`"To sum up,`
` ......she's a witch that supposedly no one believed in, except for Maria."`
`"Those words don't quite explain it.`
` ......It's not that we didn't believe.`
` ...We were trying to let {i:her} believe."`
`So this was about not betraying a child's innocence.`
`But Santa doesn't exist in reality.`
` If you don't want them to be all disappointed when they learn that, you should just not give them that dream in the first place.`
`...Did I think like that because I was still a long way from becoming a full adult?`
`Battler had finally attained a level of understanding about the true form of the Rokkenjima witch.`
`.........But the current situation lay on an even higher level of understanding than that,`
` and overturned all its premises...`
`"......That's all we believed the witch {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama to be, but then she actually appeared.`
` Right."`
`"Furthermore, judging from our parents' uproar, it looks like she wasn't an invited guest.`
` ......That sounds kinda interesting."`
`"There actually is no basis to say that a woman called {f:5:Beatrice} doesn't exist.`
` ......It's what Uncle Rudolf called a Devil's Proof.`
` ......None of us knew that a woman calling herself {f:5:Beatrice} existed."`
`"...But that doesn't mean we can deny the possibility that {f:5:Beatrice} exists."`
`"......Doctor Nanjo, you've been friends with Grandfather for a long time, right?"`
`".....................`
` ...There was a period when I was questioned quite a lot on this topic at the family conferences, by Krauss‐san and the others.`
` ......The topic of whether Kinzo‐san may have had a mistress long ago, and even a hidden child with her."`
`"I see.`
` Our parents' heads are full with the distribution of the inheritance.`
` So it's blindingly obvious that if the daughter of a mistress showed up, it'd mean trouble for them."`
`"Krauss‐san and the rest probably asked Genji‐san about it first.`
` However, Genji‐san has sworn loyalty to Kinzo‐san as his right‐hand man, ...and is probably a more trusted friend to Kinzo‐san than myself."`
`" ......I imagine Genji‐san didn't tell them anything.`
` ......And so they turned to me as his next‐oldest friend, I suppose..."`
`"And?`
` ......When all is said and done, Doctor Nanjo,`
` ......{i:did} Grandfather have a mistress called {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"...............He did.`
` ...No, I have never met her.`
` ...However, I have heard from Kinzo‐san that he did have a relationship with a woman like that.`
` .........He said that she passed away a very long time ago."`
`"......She's dead.`
` ......And did he have a child with her?"`
`"That, I do not know.`
` ......But Kinzo‐san always says that he is researching how to revive {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"...Usually, if one loses a lover and has a child left from them, they would pour all of that love on that child.`
` ......Therefore, we naturally thought that there probably wasn't a child between Kinzo‐san and {f:5:Beatrice}..."`
`"............Hm?`
` ....That makes that a Devil's Proof as well."`
`"......It does.`
` ......It's impossible to prove that he "didn't" have a child with his mistress.`
` ......So now that she's actually appeared, we have to assume that he "did"."`
`"That's a bit of a rushed argument.`
` ......It's more realistic that someone caught wind of the trouble over the Ushiromiya inheritance issue,`
` found out about Grandfather's relationship with a mistress long ago,`
` and impersonated her, trying to work their way into the inheritance issue."`
`"......It is more realistic.`
` ...However, we can't deny the possibility that she really is a hidden child,`
` who lived in isolation, forgotten by Grandfather, and who's returned for revenge, right...?"`
`"Revennnge?!`
` The hell did that come from?!"`
`"Aaah, sorry, sorry...`
` I'm a guy, we just like to embellish things to make them more interesting.`
` I've seen too many weird dramas.`
` Ihihihi!"`
`Normally, that would have been a light joke.`
`......But it had come when a mystery guest calling herself {f:5:Beatrice}, who no one had invited,`
` had marched in on the day of the family conference, the day of the inheritance distribution discussion, which even without the witch was threatening to become a bloodbath.`
`.........There was no way that Battler's joke would be welcomed with laughter.`
`So it was a really big help when Nanjo laughed energetically to calm everyone down.`
`"Hahahahaha...`
` I see, I see, that does sound quite interesting.`
` I should love to read a novel with a plot like that."`
`"Well, I don't think that could happen in reality.`
` ......After all, right now, on this island, there's one, two, three... 18 people, right?"`
`"If she did something weird, we could immediately restrain her.`
` And thanks to the typhoon, she can't even leave the island.`
` Basically, there's just no way she could even begin to pull off a crazy crime like that."`
`"......I agree.`
` In a dead‐end without any way to escape, and in a situation where everyone is suspicious of her,`
` I really don't think she could pull off a terrifying revenge tragedy like that."`
`"I imagine not.`
` ...If revenge was her aim, it would have been more realistic for her to come in secret, without showing herself.`
` You don't often hear about people appearing openly for revenge except in historical plays."`
`"I wouldn't be so sure about that?`
` Revenge is based on emotion, not frickin' logic.`
` And if she wants revenge so badly she's ready to give her life for it, she might not be much afraid of the police or the number of people or that there's no way out."`
`"It's alright, Jessica‐chan.`
` Nothing as horrible as we imagine will happen."`
`"Ihihi!`
` Like the battle royal between our parents over the inheritance isn't horrible."`
`"......You're right.`
` ...Dad and Uncle Rudolf are pretty tough, and Auntie Eva's even trained in the martial arts.`
` ......We'll be OK.`
` Yeah..."`
`Jessica didn't say it, but she had vaguely noticed that her own father opposed all of the other siblings regarding the inheritance.`
`They acted like everything was good in front of the children, but when that pretense was lifted away, like it had been at dinner, it would become a tumultuous uproar.`
`It was only natural that Jessica, realizing that,`
` would be frightened that her father and mother had gotten into some kind of trouble,`
` ...and were about to be sacrificed for something terrifying...`
`"Seriously.`
` George‐aniki's right.`
` ...Nothing's gonna happen.`
` Even if she pretends she's a witch,`
` what can a single {i:human woman} who can't even use magic do?"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi..."`
`The sudden, creepy laugh made all of us jump.`
`......And when we realized that this strange laugh was coming from Maria, we were shocked again.`
`".........So that's how it is.`
` ...That's your perception, isn't it, Battler?"`
`"Wha‐.........what is?`
` Don't laugh all creepy like that."`
`"You accept {f:5:Beatrice}'s existence for now.`
` At least you accept her as the 19th person and a guest.`
` ............But that's all, right?`
` ...You don't accept that the 19th person, {f:5:Beatrice}, is a witch, right...?"`
`"You surprised us all for that?`
` ......Of course I don't.`
` {i:There's obviously no such thing as witches}.`
` It's impossible for it to be anything other than a human woman pretending to be one."`
`"......Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` Hmmm...?`
` That makes no sense, Battler.`
` ......That's a Devil's Proof, you know?`
` ......There's obviously no such thing as witches?`
` But that just means you've never met a witch,`
` and doesn't mean you can deny that witches exist, right...?"`
`"...............`
` .........That's right.`
` ...That really is right.`
` I can't prove that witches don't exist.`
` ......However, even if I can't prove it, I can claim it.`
` I claim that witches don't exist."`
`"How...?`
` How can you claim that witches don't exist even though you can't prove it...?"`
`"'Cause stuff like that doesn't exist."`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!`
` And that's QED?`
` Proof concluded without any evidence or basis?`
` A classic example of how ignorance shelves its problems.`
` A reckless suspension of thought.`
` Kihihihihihihihi...!"`
`"In that case, I have one answer, Maria.`
` ......The witch side has to show some proof themselves.`
` This is also part of the Devil's Proof.`
` ......If you bring one, it'll be over quickly."`
`"...In our case, this lady calling herself {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`just has to perform some magnificent magic, like sending out some sparkling stars with her wand or something,`
` {i:and show us something that's impossible for {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s},`
` right?"`
`"......Come now, you two.`
` Please settle down..."`
`Kumasawa noticed that the atmosphere between them was getting worse, and tried to calm them.`
`...It seemed as though Battler quickly realized that he was acting immaturely.`
`But Maria's expression didn't loosen.`
` ......She kept staring at Battler as she laughed creepily...`
`"You quit it too, Maria.`
` ...Let's get back in a good mood, alright?"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihi, kihihihihihihihihihihihihi."`
`"....................."`
`"......If that's what you want, {f:5:Beatrice} will show you, I'm sure.`
` {i:Something impossible for {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s}.`
` And then you too will believe, right?`
` About {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"............Sure.`
` ......If she lets me have a look‐see, I'll believe."`
`"It's a chess argument between the witch and you, Battler.`
` .........If you get checkmated, you will believe in the witch."`
`"Oh, that's a stylish analogy.`
` ......The witch shows her magic.`
` My king is put into check."`
`"I quibble, saying that it would be possible to reproduce that by measures even a human could take, and create an escape for my king.`
` ...If I can't do that, it's checkmate—that's a pretty good analogy."`
`"Battler.`
` ......In chess, you and your opponent have pieces which move in the same way.`
` That's why you can read your opponent's moves."`
`"............But you know what?`
` You haven't supposed that your opponent's pieces might be able to move in much more strange ways than yours.`
` You've simply assumed that, since witches shouldn't exist, the movements of {f:5:Beatrice}'s pieces will obviously be the same as your own."`
`"..........................."`
`"......But the thing is,`
` .........sorry, Battler, but your chess partner isn't {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` She's a witch.`
` ......She can move her pieces in ways that {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s can't.`
` .........Right now, your perception of that is wrong.`
` ...Battler, you like Auntie Kyrie's chessboard thinking, right?"`
`".........Yeah.`
` I like that style of thinking where you stand in your opponent's position."`
`"And that's no good.`
` Even though your opponent is a witch, you won't accept that.`
` .........So you can't understand the moves a witch can make, and your chessboard thinking won't work.`
` Your perception of your opponent is wrong.`
` The very first premise of chessboard thinking is broken down."`
`"........................Hoh,`
` ...is that what you say?"`
`"{i:{ruby:sonata:You} cannot win in chess against a witch}...!`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!"`
`"...I do not know what happened after that.`
` We servants were ordered not to approach the dining room..."`
`".........I see.`
` So, Shannon, have you, uh, ever met this person called {f:5:Beatrice} before?"`
`"...........................`
` ......I have no idea."`
`That was a slightly odd way to say it.`
`{n}I thought it didn't sound like she meant her memory was vague.`
`"......For us servants, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is another master of this mansion.`
` ......Some speak as if we spread that rumor due to having been influenced by the Master, but..."`
`"......Since the time I started working here, the story of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama was already whispered about."`
`"I heard about it before.`
` ...How you'll get cursed if you don't respect her, and how there was a servant who actually had an accident this way."`
`"Yes...`
` ......But it's true that some people believed more or less than others.`
` ...I, umm, ...believe that respect for that sort of thing shouldn't be forgotten, so I have never doubted that she exists."`
`"......I dimly believed that a...`
`...umm......uncertain being called the Golden Witch surely existed."`
`"...And then that witch whose existence was uncertain actually showed herself and came in openly through the entrance hall... Is that what happened?"`
`".........I don't know.`
` ...............I don't know...anything."`
`"............`
` ...When you brought her dinner, did you talk about anything?"`
`".................................`
` ......No, nothing."`
`"I see.`
` ...Still, a witch that eats food...somehow doesn't sound so realistic.`
` Maybe it's just someone who knows about the witch legend on this island taking on {f:5:Beatrice}'s name after all."`
`".........I think you've probably come to respect {f:5:Beatrice} and think of her as something like a guardian goddess of the mansion.`
` So when a person appeared actually calling themselves that, maybe you were a little disturbed."`
`".........`
` .........Yes.`
` I think that definitely could be it."`
`George was slightly at a loss at what to do about Shannon's downcast appearance.`
`......Possibly,`
` not just Genji, but also the young servants, including Shannon,`
` had been strictly questioned about whether they had a clue as to who this person called {f:5:Beatrice} was...`
`Thinking that, he had tried to cheer her up somehow.`
`Like Maria and Jessica, Shannon too must be unable to completely hide her agitation over the sudden visit of a person calling herself the Golden Witch.`
`He thought that must be the case.`
`{n}...But George had no way of knowing what was in Shannon's heart.`
`Shannon was bitter and sad.`
`......The door to the Golden Land...would be opened.`
`{n}......The witch had definitely told her that.`
`That meant...the demise of everything.`
`.........Even if she accepted the ring from George,`
` ............now, they could never be married.`
`No, .........in the first place...`
`{n}...Did furniture like her......have the right to be married?`
`Even if the witch hadn't come to tell of their demise, ......wasn't it fated to fail sometime or another?`
`Hadn't she turned her gaze towards the fun days with George, ...and purposefully closed her eyes to the sad reality?`
`"............What's wrong?`
` ...You've really been seeming down for a while now."`
`"George‐san.`
` ......What does it mean...to be engaged?"`
`"Huh?!`
` Ah, ......err!`
` It means making a promise to marry.`
` ...But the way I think of it, it means the same thing as marriage."`
`"......Honestly, I want to take you as my wife right now, and take you back home.`
` ......But right now, I am in the middle of training, and I'm still a long way from gaining the ability needed to create my own castle.`
` That's why I want to become an independent man first, and only then, proudly take you home with me."`
`"I'm not talking about the distant future.`
` I just want you to wait a short three years.`
` ......But even so, I don't want to lie about my feelings for the next three years."`
`"So, ......I decided to give you an engagement ring.`
` ......That might be a shameful reason as a man.`
` An engagement because I want you to wait, because I can't balance a wife and a job, might be shameful.`
` ......But I will never—"`
`".........Thank you very much.`
` ...I now understand that to you, an engagement ring isn't just another present you would give to a lover."`
`"O‐of course not.`
` An engagement ring isn't a simple accessory.`
` It's an oath between lovers, a precious promise left in the form of a ring."`
`".........*giggle*.`
` ...In that case, if we got married quickly, it would become unnecessary, right?"`
`"The‐then it wouldn't be an engagement ring I'd give you.`
` I'd give it to you as a wedding ring.`
` ......Either way, it won't change the fact that I'll give you a ring."`
`"So it's like a sales contract, saying "This woman is mine, nobody touch her"."`
`"Nn......no, umm, ......that's not what I......`
` ...............*cough*."`
`George knew about his shameful character.`
` When he had fallen for Shannon, and sworn to become an excellent man, he had sworn to part ways with that shameful part of himself.`
`......So, he chose to answer a little roughly on purpose.`
`{n}...Believing that Shannon would find it reassuring.`
`".........No, ...that may be exactly it.`
` .........Sayo.`
` I'll make you my wife.`
` ...I won't give you to anyone else.`
` I'll make you all mine.`
` ...So no one better lay a hand on you.`
` ......That's what this ring is.`
` ...Without a doubt."`
`"Thank you very much, George‐san.`
` ............I'm truly...happy."`
`Then, George‐san.`
`......If it was decided by fate that this engagement ring, ......that this promise would not be fulfilled, ......would you still give it to me...?`
`...Shannon was about to ask that, ...but she swallowed her words.`
`Because George had already spoken the answer.`
`......George had said it.`
` He had said that to him, an engagement ring was infinitely similar to a wedding ring.`
`Therefore, accepting George's ring had a far more sacred significance than a promise to marry.`
`"Which is why...`
`...I will stop calling this an engagement ring.`
` From now on, this isn't an engagement.`
` It's a wedding ring."`
`"Is, ...is that alright...?`
` Is it alright to, umm, just proclaim that we're married without God's blessing......?"`
`"Yeah.`
` It's enough to tell God, Father, and Mother about it afterwards.`
` We'll declare that the two of us have been joined in marriage.`
` ..........No one can overturn it."`
`".........George‐san......"`
`"I'm not saying this because of a momentary emotion.`
` I'm not just looking at how you are now.`
` .........I'm looking at how you will be tomorrow, and the next day.`
` ...I'm even gazing at you as you'll be in old age, in the future, as I say this."`
`"......You are always telling me about that, George‐san.`
` ...About how you want to spend your old age slowly, surrounded by sprightly children and grandchildren."`
`"Yeah.`
` At that time, an older you will be beside me.`
` That is what I predict—no—what I foresee.`
` ...Yes.`
` Because that day will surely come."`
`".....................Will it...`
`surely come?`
` {e:070:......Is it OK......for me to believe?}{e:100:"}`
`"Yes.`
` Surely.`
` Definitely.`
` ......And this ring proves it without words."`
`"............Show it to me...`
`...please."`
`"Huh?`
` Ah,`
` ah,`
` ah,`
` .........h‐he‐here it is...!"`
`George, thinking he was being told to show her the ring, hurriedly took out the ring box.`
`...Even though he had practiced so much, he hadn't been able to look cool.`
`But Shannon wasn't looking at that.`
`......With a straight and direct gaze, with faint tears and a smile...`
`.........She was staring right at George's eyes—no, into something she could see beyond his eyes...`
`"......Show me...`
`......that future,`
` .........please."`
`"Ah............yeah.`
` ......I'll show it to you.`
` For sure.`
` ......I promise.`
` .........And not just until old age.`
` ...After we die too.`
` ...Even if we become spirits, we'll always, always be together."`
`Shannon wiped away her tears and took the ring box.`
` Inside was a diamond ring more than worthy of blessing the two of them.`
`George said the line that he had practiced over and over again inside his head.`
`"I, ......I want you to put that ring on whatever finger you like, and have that be your answer.`
` Umm, so, by tomorrow morning......"`
`"......*giggle*."`
`Shannon smiled, took the ring,`
` ......and with a completely natural movement, put it on the ring finger of her left hand.`
`It really had looked, ......like a very, very natural movement,`
` and for a while, George was stunned...`
`"This...is my answer.`
` ...George‐san."`
`"Shannon......`
` No,`
` .........Sayo..............."`
`"......Even if we become spirits,`
` .........we'll always,`
` ............always......`
`be together.`
` .........George‐san."`
`There was no blessing from God, no pastor to witness, nothing.`
`{n}But the two to be married had proclaimed it.`
`{n}...Two souls were joined here today.........`
`".....................Nee‐san, ............you're an idiot."`
`"......Am I really?"`
`"Even though you're furniture......`
` ......Even though...you're furniture......!"`
`"I'm not furniture.`
` Not anymore."`
`"......Liar!!`
` Why are you fooling yourself?!`
` You know that you can never become human!`
` You know that you can't become human unless you go to the Golden Land!!"`
`"......So why did you throw away the promise that enabled you to go to the Golden Land...?!!"`
`"Oh yeah.`
` By accepting the ring, ......that promise with {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama comes to nothing, doesn't it?`
` ......*giggle*, sorry."`
`"............Now, me, you, George‐sama, the Master, each and every one of us has the same conditions.`
` Thirteen people will be made sacrifices.`
` Only five will be invited to the Golden Land.`
` ......And you......rejected one of those places,`
` ......yourself......"`
`"That's odd.`
` ......It looks like you're the one with lingering regrets, Kanon‐kun."`
`"You're the one with regrets, aren't you, Nee‐san!`
` You got engaged, right?!`
` Even though you knew it was a fate that would never be fulfilled!!"`
`"Yep.`
` ...I promised that we would always, always be together, for eternity."`
`"......So you know what?`
` ......In that instant, our eternity was completed.`
` Even if we become sacrifices, it's already completed.`
` So, it's alright."`
`".........Kanon‐kun, you're the one who actually has regrets.`
` ...We're furniture, right?`
` No matter what the result, we will be freed.`
` ...In that case, it doesn't matter whether we go to the Golden Land or not."`
`"......And yet you're set on going to the Golden Land.`
` .........You want to become human no matter what, right?`
` ...Why?"`
`"Because I want to become human!!`
` I've had enough of being furniture!!"`
`"Why?"`
`"I...wanted to fall in love as well...!!!"`
`Tears spilled from both of Kanon's eyes.`
` ...And he howled.`
`"......I...liked Milady...!!`
` And after seeing Milady on that day, I started liking her even more...!`
` And when I heard that Milady also liked me, I was really happy...!!`
` But I'm furniture, ......and I can't accept Milady's feelings!!"`
`"...That's where you're wrong.`
` .........We may be furniture.`
` We may be less than human.`
` ...But I learned that doesn't mean we aren't qualified to love."`
`"I believed that if we couldn't make those feelings eternal, we were better without them!!`
` I just decided that someday, a day would come when I would disappear, and that would definitely hurt her, .........no, that's wrong!!"`
`"I was just frightened!!`
` I......was just afraid, and thought that if love could not be eternal, I was better off not knowing it!!"`
`"......Cicadas fall in love during a span of only a few weeks out of their whole lives, and then they disappear.`
` .........I don't think there are any cicadas that don't fall in love because it will be over in a few weeks."`
`"Uuuuuuuuuuughhh!!`
` Uuuuu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}uughhh!!"`
`It seemed that Kanon was still speaking of his regrets, but by now it was all jumbled up in his crying voice...`
`"......I hate that witch...!!`
` ...Why did she plant these feelings in me...?!`
` If only, if only she hadn't pulled that weird prank, I wouldn't have payed Milady any notice...!!!"`
`"............{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is so cruel, isn't she.`
` ...To make you cry bitter tears, she played games with your fate.`
` .........But, the witch probably isn't achieving what she plotted.`
` ...After all—"`
`Knowing love isn't a lingering attachment that ties you to life.`
` It is the place we should reach on our journey through life...`
`So there you have it, Kanon.`
`That promise you worked so hard for has now come to nothing.`
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
`Well now.`
` With this, the conditions for all of the pieces are the same.`
`There are eighteen pieces! Thirteen will be sacrificed!`
`Who will the five survivors be?`
`............Or.`
`Will someone destroy this ritual?`
`Who?!! How?!`
`Fuhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
`This isn't a chess problem.`
` It's a game on equal footing.`
`I won't be closing in one‐sidedly.`
`You can frantically run from my advances, and make it a tie, a result of no contest.`
`Well, the best you can do is have that repeat over and over.`
`And it probably won't be that difficult for you.`
`However, these no contest results will continue forever, soon wearing down your mind, and eventually killing it.`
`At that time, you will accept your defeat and surrender to me!!`
`The reason I said it was a fair game.`
`......That is because the rules for my loss have also been established.`
`There's nothing so boring as a game you can't lose, you see.`
`The way to defeat me.`
`That is...the epitaph offered to my portrait.`
`That is both the way to open the door to the Golden Land and the key to destroying my ritual.`
`I complete the ritual according to the epitaph.`
`You solve the epitaph's riddle, destroy the ritual and overthrow me...!`
`Solve the riddle hidden in the epitaph, and expose the location of the vast gold I gave to Kinzo!!`
`What result will this game show us?!`
`I'm expecting a good fight from you.`
`Entertain me, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeer!!`
`"................................."`
`"...............I have no objections.`
` ...Natsuhi and I accept it."`
`".........Ggh......`
` ...I can't believe it, ...and I don't want to, but...`
`......that is......reality, isn't it..."`
`"...Natsuhi.`
` Choose your words more carefully.`
` .........She is this family's most honored guest."`
`"............W‐we accept it too.`
` ...There's nothin' more to say."`
`"Yes.`
` ...I accept it.`
` .........I have absolutely no complaints.`
` I can't believe that you really......`
` .........I have to honestly respect you."`
`"Me too...`
` ............Incredible.`
` I genuinely respect you.`
` ......So I have to accept it."`
`"I accept it too...`
` .........Still can't believe it.`
` ...But, .........what can you do?`
` {i:You've proven devils!}`
` You win...!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!`
` The Devil's Proof was a convenient excuse that you liked using to show that something was impossible to prove, ......but now it's become your mortal enemy, has it not?"`
`"......Don't torture me, great witch.`
` .........I've already accepted you.`
` I resign."`
`"................................."`
`".........Kyrie.`
` Do you still have any objections...?`
` I must have everyone in agreement.`
` If you alone will not accept my existence..."`
`As the witch laughed boldly, the siblings started to panic.`
`{n}...They were afraid of displeasing the witch.`
`Kyrie lightly closed her eyes, ...and after keeping silent for a while, opened her mouth.`
`"...My apologies.`
` ......I resign."`
`Only Kyrie had faced the witch with stern eyes until the end.`
`......However, she had only been able to resist acknowledging the truth for a short time.`
`The reality—the being—that was before her eyes...couldn't be denied.`
`{n}{i:Devils had already been proven}...!`
`".........I also...accept it.`
` ......You are {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` The Ushiromiya family alchemist.`
` ...And a user of great magic.`
` ..................I must accept the fact that you are a witch...!"`
`......What was the sound that always filled the ears?`
`{n}The sound of the rain, the sound of a waterfall, or was it radio static?`
`In that case, I want it to be the sound of blood flowing through the body.`
` ......I want it to be the sound of the blood circulating throughout my body, telling me that I am still alive...`
`".....................Hmm...`
` ......Is it...morning...?"`
`The light entering through a crack in the curtain was faint, but it at least told him that dawn had broken.`
`Kinzo, still in the same pose he had when he awoke, ...still sitting in his chair and looking up at the ceiling, ...felt the blood slowly travel throughout his body...`
`...Judging by the clock, it was early morning, six on the dot.`
` ......No matter how tired he was, no matter how deeply he slept, he woke up at exactly this time, as though he had measured it with an hourglass.`
`He didn't think that something like this was worthy of boasting of, but he told himself that while he could still do something like this, he was still in robust health.`
`".........Morning has come, which means...`
` ...............Hmmm.`
` ......It seems that I've escaped being one of the first sacrifices.`
` ......Was the result of the roulette fortunate, ...or is this the fruit of my efforts?`
` It is irritating that I cannot tell the difference, but I will not say that."`
`Kinzo was very slightly driven by a temptation to look at the other side of the study door.`
`Because he thought that maybe he might find the traces of a vain struggle to break the door,`
` made by something trying to select him as one of the first six sacrifices.`
`"...Hmph.`
` .........Humans are cheap creatures.`
` ......They claim to do their best and leave the rest to Providence, yet when they are given good fortune, they desire to flatter themselves that it arose not from simple luck, but from their own ability."`
`So he wanted to check whether there was a wretched mark on the door.`
`{n}...That is only human.`
`Therefore, Kinzo did not check.`
` He repressed the things that he wanted to do because he was human.`
` By that, Kinzo could immerse himself in a feeling of sufficiency, as though he had become a being that surpassed humans...`
`He became aware of human desire, and forbade it.`
`{n}Things that a human wanted to do, he resisted.`
`......This eccentric and rebellious sense had surely given him a rare genius,`
` which must have allowed him to succeed in his exploits as he revived the Ushiromiya family in one generation...`
`"Well then, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` What were the six pieces you took?`
` ......And what will your next move be?`
` ...Entertain me.`
` .........My defense is perfect.`
` I will not shame myself like last time.`
` ......Heh, ......heheheh."`
`The servants woke early.`
` They had to open the curtains, prepare breakfast, and complete various other tasks to welcome the guests to a new day.`
`Gohda was the most enthusiastic.`
`He had been told to concentrate his efforts in particular on his work as a chef for the duration of the family conference,`
` and he had been specially exempted from several tasks that servants normally must do.`
`...It seemed that Gohda, who was a show off, had a particular feeling of supremacy about that.`
` He left the preparations of the inside of the mansion to Genji and the rest, and worked on preparing breakfast in the kitchen.`
`Genji split the work with Shannon and Kanon, and they carried out various tasks.`
`Shannon headed to the dining hall and knocked.`
`...Last year, the family conference had continued into the small hours of the night.`
` It wouldn't have been odd for this year's conference to continue all the way into the next morning.`
`So she had knocked out of consideration for the possibility that they were still having a discussion inside.`
`But there was no response, so she opened the door and said good morning.`
`"...Good morning.`
` ...............Is anyone there?"`
`The room was cold, and it seemed that the conference had ended a long time before.`
`On top of the table, there was a tea set, from which they had probably been drinking, arranged in a way that would make it easy to clean them up.`
`Cleaning away the tea was a servant's job.`
` So if the family was too caring and cleaned it up themselves, the servants would lose face.`
`Therefore, just doing this much for the servants truly was a pleasing act of kindness.`
`As she approached the table to clean it away, she noticed that something like a memo had been left along with the cups.`
`It had been placed together with the tea set, so, naturally thinking it was a memo for the servant cleaning up, Shannon took it.`
`Written on it was not a request, nor thanks for preparing the tea, but just a single word.`
`Shannon looked at it blankly, and read it out loud...`
`"............Chapel.`
` ...............?"`
`A small sound kept repeating over and over.`
`{n}It was a sound that would ordinarily have been trivial and insignificant.`
`I hope I stop hearing it soon, then I could return to my doze, someone thought vaguely.`
`...But no matter how much time passed, the sound did not end.`
`{n}It repeated over and over.`
`Aaah, shut up.`
`{n}Who is that?`
` Banging on the door constantly.`
`As soon as she realized this, she woke up.`
`{n}......Someone was knocking.`
`Then she noticed that there wasn't just a knock, but a voice too.`
`".........Rosa‐sama, ...Rosa‐sama.`
` ......Good morning."`
`"Wa‐......wait.`
` I'm coming now."`
`It had been Genji's voice.`
`{n}Looking at the clock, it was still before seven.`
`......It was clearly too early to wake the guests.`
`{n}...Did something happen that was bad enough to cause this?`
`She felt her sleepiness increasingly fade thanks to this ominous premonition.`
`Because Genji had been a familiar servant to Rosa since her childhood days, she opened the door a crack and answered, even though she was slightly defenseless in her pajamas.`
`"Good morning.`
` I apologize for waking you this early."`
`"......Did something happen?"`
`"Yes...`
` .........Actually, at the chapel, {nobreak:{m:-5:——}—}"`
`Genji spoke into Rosa's ear, and told her something in a small voice.`
`It seemed that Rosa couldn't understand what she was being told after only hearing it once,`
` and after repeating the words back to him several times, she finally realized that apparently, something strange had happened.`
`Rosa closed her door for a second, and after changing her clothes, she immediately accompanied Genji and they headed to the mansion...`
`The chapel requires some explanation.`
` It wasn't in the mansion, but in a grove behind the mansion, which could be reached after a short walk.`
`It had been built at the same time that the mansion had been constructed on Rokkenjima,`
` so while its outside walls had been repaired many times, making it look new from the outside, it was a very old building.`
`Rosa and Genji dashed through the rain together.`
`{n}Just like the previous night, the rain was falling in earnest.`
`Eventually, they began to see the chapel beyond a sparse grove...`
`If all she knew of it was its appearance from the outside, it might have felt like a place of dazzling beauty, where a pair of young lovers might want to hold a ceremony.`
`However, it seemed that in Kinzo's eyes, this was a very sacred place,`
` and Rosa and her siblings had been harshly told not to approach it unnecessarily.`
`So even at this age, and no matter what the reason for it, she felt some guilt in approaching the chapel,`
` and was gripped by the fear that this would surely make her father so angry he would slap her across the face...`
`The servants' silhouettes could be seen in front of the entrance to the chapel.`
`{n}Gohda, Shannon and Kanon.`
`......Which meant that all of the servants on the morning shift had gathered.`
`A short while ago, Rosa had been told the nature of the situation verbally by Genji.`
` However, ...without laying eyes on it directly, she really hadn't been able to understand...`
`Probably, all of the servants gathered there were the same.`
`......{i:Without seeing it with their own eyes}, they couldn't understand what was going on.`
`Because, on the door that was the entrance to the chapel,`
` ......drawn very large, ......with a creepy, sticky paint‐like substance that made one think of blood, ...was something like a creepy magic circle.`
`"Wh‐`
`.........what is...`
`...this............?`
` When was it drawn here?!"`
`The servants looked at each other.`
`{n}Gohda was the first to open his mouth.`
`"...My, ...my apologies.`
` We do not usually trespass here, so we do not know when it was drawn."`
`"Then, who was the first person to find it?!"`
`"Tha‐...that was me.`
` ......When I went to the dining hall to clean away the tea set, ......there was a memo with "chapel" written on it..."`
`Shannon held out the memo with a shaking hand.`
`"......Whose handwriting?`
` It isn't Nii‐san's or Nee‐san's handwriting.`
` ...And then you came here and found this, right?"`
`"Yes......"`
`"...Rosa‐sama, .........look at this."`
`"What?`
` ...............<Happy Halloween>...<for>...`
`......wha—?!"`
`Kanon was pointing at a single line of English written below the creepy magic circle.`
`Until it had been pointed out to her, she had thought it was just another part of the magic circle, and hadn't noticed it.`
`Written there in English were the words "Happy HALLOWEEN for MARIA.".`
`Happy Halloween...for Maria.`
`{n}A wish for an enjoyable Halloween.`
` For Maria.`
`{n}A creepy magic circle.`
` For Maria.`
`{n}Happy Halloween.`
`The only person who said the words Happy Halloween to Maria yesterday......`
`The symbols matched.`
` ......The Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}...!`
`"Wh‐what about Maria?!`
` That kid should be sleeping with her cousins, right?`
` Did you check?!"`
`"......My apologies.`
` We just now realized that Maria‐sama's name was written here.`
` ...We still have not checked.`
` I shall―"`
`"What are you doing?!!`
` I'll go check on Maria and come back!`
` Also, inform Krauss nii‐san and the rest.`
` Receive their instructions on how to proceed!"`
`...After saying that much, Rosa finally noticed that something was out of place.`
`Her own rank within this family conference was the lowest of the four siblings.`
`......In an abnormal situation like this, why had she been the only one called, when the other siblings hadn't?`
`...Even if Maria's name had popped up.`
`"Don't tell me......huh?`
` ......What...?!"`
`"......Ye‐yes.`
` We tried to contact Krauss‐sama,`
` ...but could not find him..."`
`"And Madam was not in her room.`
` ...Judging by the condition of the sheets, she may not have returned to her bed at all last night."`
`Rosa felt something creepy crawling slowly up her back...`
`".........Di‐...did you check inside the chapel?"`
`"No, not yet.`
` We did try to check inside, but..."`
`"......Actually, the lock to the chapel is special, so the master key does not work.`
` There is a single key which can open it, ......but that key is missing from the key box."`
`She didn't want to get any closer to the door with the creepy magic circle if she could help it.`
`Rosa readied herself and approached, and tried pushing and pulling the knob.`
` ...All she felt was the resistance of the sturdy lock.`
`"We searched to see whether there was a window through which we could enter, but...`
`I think that, in order to check inside, we would have to break one of the windows...`
` What do you think?"`
`"...There's no way I can give you approval to do that.`
` It's Father's precious chapel, I can't do something like that.`
` ....................."`
`Then the events of the previous day swirled around in the back of Rosa's mind...`
`......That's right,`
` ......when I met that witch in the rose garden,`
` ...didn't she hand Maria an envelope?`
` Yes, I'm positive, she did.`
`When Maria had tried to open it, that witch had told her not to do that yet, and then she had definitely said,`
` "{i:The time will come soon to open it}"...`
`Rosa became convinced.`
`{n}......There could be no doubt.`
`{n}......That letter which had been handed to Maria............`
`After dashing back to the guesthouse, Rosa approached the cousins' room while hiding her footsteps,`
` softly opened the door, and peered inside...`
`From the inside, she could hear the healthy snores of young people.`
`The four children were all there.`
` Maria was there.`
` ...Sleeping soundly.`
`After heaving a sigh of relief, she entered the room with quiet footsteps.`
`{n}......She was after Maria's handbag, which was resting on the sofa.`
`Maria always liked walking around with her treasures.`
`{n}...She was probably imitating how her mother always carried her makeup with her.`
`Of course, she was just copying her, so on the inside, it was full of junk.`
`In Maria's case, it was full of small, creepy, occult‐like items, and a notebook with things like that written in it.`
`......Rosa hadn't once been happy to see her daughter walking around with those kinds of ungirlish things.`
`However, after she had tried to force Maria to stop, they had gotten into a big fight, and she had decided to let it be.`
`"........................... ...Here it is.`
` .........This is it........."`
`A Western envelope with the crest of the gold eagle...`
`When she took it out, she could tell that there was a heavy, cylindrical object inside.`
`...She could tell by its feel and its weight.`
`{n}......There was no doubt.`
`{n}This was......a key.`
`After turning around and checking that Maria was still sound asleep,`
` Rosa tore open the envelope, and tipped out the contents into her palm.`
`......It was a key with an old and intricate design...`
`{n}Rosa grasped that key, and dashed out.`
`...It seemed that Battler noticed those sounds, but after grumbling and turning over in his sleep, he started snoring again...`
`"......Genji‐san.`
` ......Could this key......be the key to the chapel?"`
`"Where did you......`
` ...Yes, this is the key to the chapel."`
`Rosa approached the creepy magic circle once again, ......and put the key in the keyhole.`
`......There was a strong resistance.`
` After it resisted for a short while, ...it stopped that resistance with a clunk.`
`Then, squeaking with a noise that hurt one's ears, it slowly, slowly began to open.........`
`"...............Is anyone......there............?!"`
`Her voice reverberated throughout the massive room.`
`{n}...Of course, there was no answer.`
`The chapel had a high ceiling, and the air was cold.`
`...And even on this rainy, unsettling day, for some reason, it felt sacred...`
`The servants timidly followed after Rosa.`
`"......Rosa‐sama, look at that."`
`Kanon noticed it immediately, and pointed.`
`......Over there...was the altar.`
`In the place where normally a pastor would preach of God's love, there was a table that shouldn't have been there.`
`At first, it looked like a dining table.`
` ...And there actually were gorgeous plates and utensils set on the table, enough to make you think it was a child's birthday party or something.`
`Upon closer inspection, the surrounding area had been decorated with pumpkins and black and orange ribbons.`
` They were probably......Halloween decorations.`
`And there were people seated at the table.`
`{n}Three people on each side facing each other, seated in chairs.`
`They could be recognized at a glance.`
`{n}Krauss and his wife, Eva and her husband, and Rudolf and his wife.`
`But if you were asked if these were definitely them, you'd still have to go even closer to check.`
`......Because they seemed almost like dolls.`
`Rosa and the rest had opened the door, entered all at once with the sound of many footsteps, and called out, asking if anyone was there.`
`...And yet, there had been no reaction.`
` ...Even assuming they had chosen to ignore them, normally you'd expect there to be some kind of reaction.`
`......And there hadn't even been that.`
`So at first, it felt like someone had set down some dolls that looked a lot like them...`
`......By now, it wasn't just Rosa.`
`{n}......Shannon and Kanon, and even Gohda.`
`...They were all fighting frantically against the rising creepy emotion tightly grasping their hearts.`
`"......Nii‐san...?`
` .........Nee‐san.........?"`
`As she climbed up to the altar, she called out again, but still, the others gave no reaction.`
`......Yes, ...by now, Rosa had accepted it.`
`......They were not dolls—`
`{n}{i:she had accepted that they were those very people}......!`
`"............This is........."`
`".................."`
`They approached close enough to be able to see clearly what was on the table.`
`Just like their first impression, it looked like a lovely banquet, reminiscent of a child's birthday party.`
`Plates piled up with sweets, glasses with lovely drinks.`
`{n}Several ornaments in the shape of pumpkins...`
`...They were all decorated in a Halloween style, ...and while it might have been an irrelevant thought at a time like this, ...she thought that this would surely make Maria happy if she could see it.`
`They were seated in front of that table, and it looked like they were sleeping......`
`It was an eerie scene, ...as though a small, fun‐looking Halloween party had been stopped in time...`
`"......They're all......`
`......sleeping...?`
` ............?"`
`When she approached even closer to them, ......she realized that candies were scattered all over the floor.`
`There were candies in very fancy wrapping, cookies, fizzy lemon sweets, chocolates...`
`And they were all distributed across the carpet, which was covered with blackberry and cranberry jam...`
`"......Wa...uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?!"`
`Rosa and the rest.........finally realized what the situation was......`
`It was...a Halloween party.`
`{n}A banquet for those not of this world...!`
`Krauss, Natsuhi, Eva, Hideyoshi, Rudolf, and Kyrie, six people in all, were seated in the chairs, ......dead as though they were sleeping.`
`How could you tell that they were dead and not simply sleeping?`
`That was because...`
`......they were,`
` ......from their chests to their stomachs,`
` .........v‐`
`...vertically...`
`......sliced open.........!`
`"K‐......Krauss‐sama............!!`
` HiiiIIIiiiiiiiii......!"`
`".....................How......cruel..."`
`The six of them were seated at a Halloween party, all of them...killed, with their stomachs sliced open.`
`Was the jam that covered the floor something that they couldn't finish eating...which had overflowed out of their stomachs...?`
`......No!!`
`The contents of their stomachs had been splattered all across the floor!!`
`{n}And that wasn't all.`
`From their stomachs, ......almost as though, ......almost as though!`
`{n}As though they had spilled out!!`
` Swee‐...sweets!`
`Candies and cookies, fizzy lemon sweets and chocolates...`
`......had spilled out, stained with blood, and had scattered across the floor!!`
`What could have happened to cause this?!`
`It was almost as though the insides of their stomachs had been stuffed full with sweets,`
` ......and when their stomachs had been cut, it had all flowed out!!`
`Rosa remembered a gross‐out meal, a turkey that had been served at her own birthday when she was a young girl.`
`When she had put the knife in, ......from the inside, her very favorite—but because no one had told her about it at all—`
`bright‐red—bright‐red—ketchup omelet‐rice had...poured out like blood‐stained maggots,`
` buwaa,`
` dripping,`
` slimy,`
` pulpy,`
` sticky!!`
`"Uerreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeechgh!!`
` Eeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`The trauma of her youth was revived.`
` Rosa felt a monster raging inside her stomach, as the acid started to rise up.`
`...Unable to hold back, she threw up on the floor.`
`Her empty stomach couldn't throw up anything but stomach acid.`
`This scene in front of her was no longer a fun Halloween party by any means...!`
`The three couples had been placed there, with their stomachs vertically wrenched open,`
` wrenched open with a gyuiiiiiiigupaaa.`
`Lots and lots of sweets had been stuffed in there, pulpy,`
` pugyurubugyu.`
`Blood and guts and sweets were overflowing onto the floor,`
` ......blood‐stained,`
` sticky,`
` sticky,`
` sloppy,`
` pulpy,`
` sweet candy stuck to each finger,`
` gummy,`
` gummy,`
` aaah, but it's stained with their entrails,`
` sloppy,`
` pulpy!`
` What was that I stepped on just now, that didn't feel like a candy or a cookie or a fizzy lemon sweet or a chocolate!`
`Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah, I'm so scared I can't even look at the bottom of my foot to see what I stepped on!!`
`Aaaaaawaaaakiiiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!`
`...What a, what a gruesome Halloween party...!!!`
`From far away, it looked really beautiful, fantastical, and fun.`
`{n}And when you see it up close, it's really terrible, disgusting, and yet still somehow beautiful...!!`
`"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`Rosa's wild thoughts tried as best they could to escape her throat with a loud voice that was neither a scream nor a roar...`
`"...............Krauss‐sama............"`
`"......This is...horrible...... Just horrible........."`
`"......A‐ambulance...`
` ......Police.........!"`
`"Tha‐......that's right, the police...`
` Police, police police police police!!"`
`If a word tied to reality like "police" hadn't come out of Gohda's mouth, Rosa and the rest would probably still have been unable to escape this nightmarish party.`
`...But that wasn't because they thought that the police might be able to do something.`
`If they didn't say police, police out loud, ......it felt like another seat would be set up at this demon's party and given to them...!!`
`It felt like their own stomachs were getting uncomfortably filled from the inside!!`
` Rumbling,`
` churning...`
` It was surely because candy was starting to overflow from their stomachs!!`
`Rosa was again tortured by a desire to vomit, and threw up her stomach acid on the floor.`
` And then she searched.`
` To see whether there was any candy mixed in!!`
`"......Haah, .........haah, ......haah......!!`
` *wheeze*, ......haah...`
` ......A‐......anyway!!`
` *cough*, *cough*!!"`
`Rosa coughed violently again, and violently spat up the stomach acid that burned her throat onto the floor.`
`She realized that by now, her whole body had become covered in filthy sweat...`
`"Ge‐...Genji‐san, Shannon‐chan, please ask Father for instructions.`
` Gohda‐san, go together with Kanon‐kun and call the police.`
` ...Then, have Doctor Nanjo come here and..."`
`Have Nanjo come here and {i:what}?`
`{n}It's way too late for medical care......!`
`The servants accepted their orders and dashed outside.`
`After watching them leave, ...............Rosa once again fixedly cast her eyes upon her siblings, who had been through life's joys and sorrows with her, and their partners.`
` ......Even though there could be nothing more tragic, ...for some reason, their fantastical deaths tempted her...`
`to describe them as beautiful.........`
`"...They're not here.`
` Where'd they go?"`
`"The servant room and the kitchen are both empty, too.`
` ...What the hell happened?"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Mamaaa!!`
` Mamaaa, where are youuu?!!`
` My letter!`
` My letter I got from Beato!`
` Give it back!`
` Give it baaaack!!`
` Wau‐aau‐auu!!"`
`"Perplexing.`
` ...Battler‐kun, are you sure it was Auntie Rosa?"`
`"......Well, I was half‐asleep so I'm not too confident.`
` But I get the feeling that, at dawn, Auntie Rosa came in and fished around in Maria's handbag."`
`"...I was just half‐asleep, and assumed that there was a tube of toothpaste or something in Maria's handbag."`
`"Why would there be a tube of toothpaste in Maria's handbag?`
` I'd bet my ass you dreamed the whole thing."`
`Battler vaguely remembered Rosa entering the cousins' room.`
` And Maria, who had woken up first, had started rampaging around, saying that someone had opened the envelope that she had been keeping safe.`
`...And so they had started wondering whether Rosa might have come and opened it.`
`"......A letter from the Golden Witch...`
` I wonder what was inside."`
`"Who knows.`
` ...But that envelope was one with the Ushiromiya family crest on it, for Grandfather's personal use.`
` ............It's hard to believe that what was in there doesn't have anything to do with the family conference."`
`She hadn't let anyone touch it, but yesterday, Maria had bragged a lot about the envelope to Battler and the rest.`
` ...So they remembered it well.`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Mama, give it back!`
` Mama, give it back!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!`
` Waauuuuuuuuuuuuu!!"`
`"......If you're right, George‐aniki, it sounds pretty important.`
` ...But if it was so important, why did the witch give it to Maria?`
` ...I don't have a clue."`
`The refreshing morning atmosphere had been completely wiped out by the occasional sounds of thunder.`
`...It was only natural.`
` Since the time they had woken up, they hadn't met anyone other than themselves.`
`It felt like the mansion had become an empty husk, leaving only them behind.`
`"......Heeeeey!`
` Anyone theeeere?!`
` Answer mee!"`
`After Jessica called out into the hallway, an answer finally came back.`
` It was from the entrance hall.`
`"I can hear youu.`
` ...Has something happened?"`
`"It's Doctor Nanjo.`
` ...Great.`
` It looks like everyone hasn't disappeared from this island but us."`
`"Doctor Nanjo, good morning.`
` ...Umm, sorry, but do you know where our parents went...?"`
`"Dear me.`
` ...I have only just come here after waking up, you see.`
` I have no idea, I'm afraid."`
`It was only natural.`
` Nanjo was a guest like the rest of them.`
` He had just now come to pass the time in the parlor until breakfast.`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Doctor Nanjo, Mama took it, Mama took my letter!!`
` Give it back, give it back, uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`Maria buried her face in Nanjo's well‐built stomach, sobbing and crying.`
`...Nanjo could do nothing but be bewildered at what was going on so early in the morning.`
`".........nn.`
` Someone's running this way.`
` Jessica!`
` Someone's coming!"`
`From down the hall, they could sense people running hurriedly.`
`When they looked, they saw that it was Gohda and Kanon.`
`......Running inside the mansion should have been immodest for a servant.`
`{n}And yet, Battler and the rest didn't even think to question that now.`
`Maria's sobbing had become so unmanageable, they wanted to ask someone, anyone, where Rosa was.`
`But the two servants ignored Jessica as she waved her hand.`
`Gohda flew into the servant room, and Kanon, noticing that Nanjo was here, bowed and approached him at a quick pace, and whispered something into his ear.`
`"...............What did you say?`
` Rosa‐san is?"`
`"Yes.`
` I will guide you, so please accompany me."`
`"Alright..."`
`"This way."`
`Without saying anything more than that, Kanon finally noticed Jessica and bowed to her.`
`...But he wasn't calm.`
`He dashed back down the corridor by which he had come, followed by Nanjo.`
`By looking at how hurried they were, Battler and the rest realized that something bad really had happened.`
`They saw Gohda through the door to the servant room, which had been flung open.`
`...He had the telephone receiver in hand and was violently pressing the hook.`
`From that, they realized that he was trying to call a hospital, or the police, or in any event he was trying to call someone because a serious emergency had occurred.`
`"Let's go see what's going on...!"`
`"Yeah...!"`
`"Mamaaa, give it baaack!!`
` Give back my letterrr!!`
` It's {i:an invitation to the Golden Land}!!"`
`They didn't know what, ...but something was happening.`
`{n}Battler and the rest chased after Kanon and Nanjo...`
`Aaah......and then we realized.`
` Kanon‐kun had called Doctor Nanjo, but he hadn't called us.`
`...So we should never have followed.`
`I wonder if Alice didn't regret her excess curiosity when she chased after the rabbit holding a clock......`
`"No, you mustn't come in!!`
` You mustn't look!!`
` Jessica‐chan!`
` No!!"`
`"Hii...`
`......n...`
`noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!"`
`"Mom, Dad!!`
` What, ......what happened!!`
` Uuuuuuuuuuuughhh!!"`
`"......What the hell is this...`
` ......There's a limit to how degenerate you can be...`
` Isn't taking someone's life enough...`
` ......What the hell is this!!"`
`"After you'd killed them you actually bothered to sit them on chairs, slice their stomachs!!`
` And stuff a ton of sweets inside?!!`
` Why, ......why the fuck would you do something so sick?!!`
` Fuck this, fuck this!`
` Great work, shithead, looks awesome, looks fucking awesome!!`
` Uwoooooooooooooohhh!!"`
`".........It would be better if you all went outside...!`
` There is no way they would want you all to see them this way..."`
`Nanjo told the children to go outside, but no one lent him an ear.`
`"Rosa‐san, please tell them.`
` If they keep looking at something like this...it will do nothing but harm...!"`
`".................."`
`Rosa regretted her own carelessness.`
` ......She should have been able to anticipate that the children would eventually come here.`
`...She should have quickly locked it instead of standing around.`
`So now the children had come.`
`{n}They had seen it...!`
`Surely, in this very moment, they were having a sight burned into their eyes...`
`which was far more grotesque than the gross‐out food Rosa had seen in her youth...`
`While she hugged Maria, who seemed to have forgotten her emotions as she stared dumbfounded at the horrible scene,`
` Rosa shed copious tears for them and their parents.`
`The four groaning and crying voices, their sadness, ...continued to echo in a place which should have known God's love......`
`"You piece of shit!!`
` Again, another one of these murders!!`
` And yet again, you made it all elaborate, killing them like it's a perfect joke!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` I was hoping I'd hear words of gratitude rather than grief from you."`
`"Gratitude?!!`
` Did you say gratitude, you old bitch?!`
` Damn it, if there's something wrong with your ears, I'll cut them both off so you can hear better!!"`
`"Why should I have to say oh, thank you very much {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama~, about this supremely fucked‐up way of killing?! I'll beat you to death!!!"`
`"In the last game,`
` you were grieving that you couldn't see your parents' faces when they died, I believe?`
` So I left them.`
` Didn't touch them!!"`
`"{i:Take a good long look and see, that without a doubt, your father and the others have been killed}!!"`
`"R......eally, wow, you deserve full marks for top service, I'm so happy!!`
` I swore that if I choked the life out of you, I'd plow your face, but I'll take that back, I'll drag out your guts!!!"`
`"Don't give in to emotion and stop thinking.`
` My game has already begun, you know?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` I decided to leave the corpses clean this time."`
`"Do you know why?`
` When you denied my existence in the last game, you denied me by thinking in the following way."`
`"That is:`
` "{i:Their faces are crushed, so the identities of the corpses cannot be confirmed}";`
` "{i:therefore, the possibility that fake corpses had been prepared to create an alibi cannot be eliminated}";`
` "{i:as long as that possibility cannot be excluded, the human culprit theory can be maintained}"!!"`
`"What did you saaaaaay......?!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*kikiki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}kikiki!!`
` Come, Battler, are you sure you wish to leave the examination of the corpses to Nanjo?`
` Isn't it traditional in mystery novels for the doctor who performs such examinations to be an accomplice?"`
`"Then don't leave the examination to Nanjo; do it yourself.`
` Make completely sure that without a doubt, the six corpses are the people claimed, that they aren't pretending to be dead, that they really, really are dead!!"`
`"To make sure that your father and mother really have been killed by having their stomachs cut open and their entrails pulled out,`
` I suggest you stick your hand inside their stomachs and feel around inside!!!`
` Kuhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha, kiiihaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"I WON'T cry!!!`
` Damn it, damn it, ...I won't cry...!!"`
`Battler suddenly yelled.`
`His tears were still dripping down, but as though scolding himself for being girly, he slapped his face hard several times with both hands.`
`Even so, the tears still wouldn't stop.`
`{n}......However, he felt a hot blaze ignite in both his eyes.`
`"Whoever the bastard is who pulled this detestable bullshit, I'll make him pay back his debt completely!!`
` So this isn't the time to cry, think about what you're gonna do!!"`
`"Aaaah, this is no good, it's no goddamn good at all!!`
` If you have enough spare time to cry, then think!`
` This is not the time to be working your lacrimal glands!!"`
`Rather than pure hatred, maybe it was more of an evasive hatred to blot out his sadness.`
`......However, it gave a little courage to George and Jessica, who were being crushed by sadness.`
`"......That's right.`
` ...Even if we cry,`
` ......the reality of what's happened here...`
`won't change."`
`"Damn it... Damn it damn it damn it, ......damn it damn it damn it!!`
` What am I supposed to do then?!`
` What am I supposed to do...for Mom and Dad?!!"`
`"......Rosa‐sama...`
` I have returned..."`
`"Gohda‐san, what happened with the police?`
` What did they say to do?`
` Did they say when they think they'll be able to get here?"`
`"...Regarding that, ......it seems the telephones are out of order...`
` I also tried the emergency wireless, but...umm, perhaps it's the weather, but that isn't working either..."`
`"What did you say...?!`
` So, you're saying we can't contact the police?!"`
`"It's her!`
` She did something to the phone line, and made it so we can't contact the police!!"`
`When she heard that the telephones were out of order, Jessica immediately decided that it was the work of that mysterious guest.`
`Her eyes were bright‐red after so much crying, and they began to grow even more red with rage.`
`"...Yeah, there's not even any room for debate anymore!`
` I understand everything, I know the truth!`
` Who killed Mom and Dad?!"`
`"It's obvious, it's her!!`
` It has to be that witch or whatever who came yesterday!!!`
` I'll grab her by the collar!!`
` Damn it damn it damn iiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`"Jessica‐chan...!`
` Wait!`
` Gohda‐san, Kanon‐kun, go!"`
`"Ye‐yes...!"`
`"Milady, wait...!!"`
`Covering her unfocused sadness with anger, Jessica ran outside, torn apart by emotion.`
`...Thinking about it hastily, maybe the mystery guest, {f:5:Beatrice}, who had arrived yesterday, was suspicious.`
` However, at the current time, there was absolutely no proof that she was the culprit.`
`...At this moment, she was nothing more than a simple guest, and only one of many.`
`So Rosa had to make an adult decision, and stop Jessica in her hasty rampage.`
` Gohda and Kanon realized that immediately, and chased after her.`
`"......Could {f:5:Beatrice}, the guest that no one invited, be the culprit...?"`
`"I understand how Jessica feels.`
` ...I also want to make myself think that.`
` It doesn't matter who, I want to make someone the culprit and bash them right in the face!!"`
`"......But before that, we have to understand things clearly.`
` ...Who is this {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` I haven't even seen her face!!"`
`"......Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` If you're looking for her face, it decorates the big portrait in the mansion.`
` You still don't remember after looking at it for so long?`
` Kihihihihihi."`
`"...Come on, Maria.`
` ...What's so funny in a situation like this?!"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice} is a witch.`
` And the ritual to open the door to the Golden Land has finally begun.`
` These six people are sacrifices.`
` ......Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!"`
`"Now, the witch's banquet shall begin.`
` Tonight is Halloween; the witches gather now in celebration.`
` Kiiihi‐hi‐hi‐hi‐hihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!!"`
`"Maria, how many times have I told you to stop laughing in that creepy voice!"`
`The crisp sound of Rosa slapping Maria's cheek echoed through the high‐ceilinged chapel...`
`It kinda feels like, ever since the rain started yesterday—`
`no, ...ever since the island had become wrapped up in the typhoon, something has gone crazy.`
`I had arrived in Rokkenjima while it was clear, and taken a nap because I had gotten up early.`
`......When I woke up, it had already started raining.`
`And after I got up, that's when it all started.`
`Suddenly a mysterious visitor had arrived, calling herself the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}, and it feels like the world had started skewing bit by bit into something insane.`
`What happened while I was taking that nap?`
` During that time, had this island been cut off, trapped in a different world where common sense doesn't apply...?!`
`Who is this person called {f:5:Beatrice}?`
`{n}Is she some unknown person trying to involve themselves with the inheritance problem, like our parents were freaking out about at dinner last night?`
`......Or is the culprit the witch from the Legend of the Gold, like Maria says?!`
`Even if Jessica hadn't let her short temper get the better of her, in this situation, the visitor was probably the most suspicious.`
`But we mustn't jump to conclusions just like that.`
`{n}Yeah, that's no good, no good, no goddamn good at all...!!`
`I smacked my face with both hands again, cooling off my brain before it overheated.`
` Even though it might have been a waste of effort.`
`"......This is.........one of Grandfather's envelopes."`
`On a tray piled up with sweets that decorated the table, George‐aniki found a Western envelope which had the Ushiromiya family crest done on it in gold leaf.`
`And it was unopened.`
`"So, ......doesn't this mean it was sent to us?`
` If it was something Dad and the rest read, it should be open."`
`"......It seems your reasoning is correct.`
` ......Look what's written here.`
` It says "to those who remain"."`
`"Is that...a letter the culprit left...?!`
` Wha‐what's inside...?"`
`"Aniki, let's open it...!"`
`After nodding silently, George‐aniki opened it.`
`{n}......A folded letter came out.`
`".........I'll read it.`
` .........Welcome to Rokkenjima, ladies and gentlemen of the Ushiromiya family.`
` I am {f:5:Beatrice}, the alchemist for this family, under the employ of Kinzo‐sama..."`
`That letter really was a joke.`
`This {f:5:Beatrice}, who called herself the family alchemist, had announced that she was collecting the gold she had lent Grandfather, along with the interest.`
`And that interest was everything that Grandfather had created.`
`Since this tragedy was right before our eyes as this paragraph was read aloud, it clearly wasn't referring just to the wealth that Grandfather had built up.`
`......It was literal.`
` Everything that Grandfather had given birth to—`
`in other words, ...all of Grandfather's descendants, were included in the interest!`
`"Batshit insanity!!`
` What a screwed up contract!`
` So lives are the interest for gold, are they?!`
` That's like a deal with the devil!`
` Is that how you pretend to be a witch?!`
` Ha, real goddamn funny!!"`
`"......Special clause.`
` .........However, if someone is able to discover the hidden gold of this contract, {f:5:Beatrice} must abandon these rights for all time."`
`".........Mmhm......`
` ......Kinzo‐sama has already publicly displayed the location of the hidden gold within the epitaph under my portrait..."`
`"......So it's something like this.`
` If the motive for these murders was collection of the interest,`
` the condition for stopping them is to find the hidden gold she gave to Grandfather, ...is what it's saying.`
` And it also says that the secret to this is hidden in the epitaph from that portrait."`
`"So......this is a letter of challenge from the witch?`
` Break the ciphertext describing the location of the hidden gold, if you can?!`
` And it's saying that if we can't, the collection of the interest will continue as planned?"`
`"I'll beat you to death, no problem!!!"`
`"...Ba‐Battler‐kun!`
` Look...... Look here!!!"`
`The table had been full of sweets,`
` ...so even though they had been right in the open, we had assumed they were just sweets.`
`......I mean, come on, you find stuff like this a lot, right?`
`......You know, boxes of chocolate, shaped like golden ingots...!`
`"The‐......these are...not boxes of candy...`
` They're the real thing...!`
` ......These are real goddamned gold bars...!!"`
`"...It's inscribed with the crest of the One‐winged Eagle...`
` ...I've heard Mother talking about this before.`
` ......This is a gold bar from the legend of Grandfather's gold...!!"`
`Gold ingots, ...three of them, weighing a full ten kilograms each, were piled up in the very center of the table!`
` It was where the cake would be placed if it was a birthday party.`
`...In other words, this was without a doubt the birthday cake of the party known as the family conference!`
`"If these are really four‐nines‐purity ingots...`
` ...nn, *gulp*.`
` They, they're worth about 60 million yen!"`
`"You stupid biiiiiitch!!`
` That's way too cheap!!!`
` Six of our parents have been killed, and the gold you throw our way for it is a measly 60 million yen?!`
` Don't take us for fools, damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!!"`
`"......Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` ...So, it has begun, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......It's not like anyone can solve this riddle anyway.`
` So, Beato, you will definitely win."`
`"......Hurry up and open the door to the Golden Land.`
` And take me away.`
` ...Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!"`
`"Milady, please, calm yourself...!"`
`"We still don't know who the culprit is!`
` And {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is an important honored guest to the Master...!"`
`"So what?!!`
` If we grab her by the collar, she'll definitely confess!!`
` If we can look her in the eye, we'll know!!`
` I'll see through her!!`
` A witch?! {f:5:Beatrice}?!!`
` I'll expose her for who she is!!"`
`Jessica never stopped moving.`
`{n}Gohda and Kanon chased after her, doing their best to convince her, but Jessica never lent them an ear.`
`Eventually, the "Witch's VIP Room" came into view.`
`{n}This VIP room was always sealed and never used.`
`...No matter what kind of guest came, Kinzo wouldn't let them in this room.`
`......And yet, the servants were always made to clean this room, so that it could be used at any time.`
`So the servants had started calling this room the "Witch's VIP Room", after their other shapeless master.`
`Jessica also knew this.`
` And she couldn't stand that woman's arrogance in calling herself a witch, by staying in that room.`
`......The Golden Witch was just a fairy tale.`
` Come on, a witch?!`
` To Jessica, she was nothing more or less than the murderer who had brutally killed her parents!`
`Question her, make her give painful excuses, make her spit at the ground painfully, make her breathe painfully.`
`...No matter how hard she pretends to be a witch, I'll teach her that she's just a stinking, sweaty {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}!!`
`Jessica hit the door to the VIP room while yelling with all of her strength.`
`It definitely wasn't a knock.`
` ...That sound was the beating of her anger's hammer, whose message was clear: if the woman didn't open the door, she'd break it down.`
`"Open it, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` Come out!!`
` You hear me, right?!`
` Open up!!!"`
`There was no answer.`
` ...Jessica twisted the doorknob without any reservation, but she felt the resistance of the lock.`
`Jessica turned to the two servants, and spat out at them demandingly.`
`"The master key opens this, right?!`
` Open it!!"`
`"Milady...!`
` That would be horribly rude...!!"`
`Although Gohda was flustered, he still tried to somehow calm Jessica's anger.`
`......After hanging his head silently for a while, Kanon pulled a master key from his jacket pocket.`
`"Kanon‐san...!`
` Is that alright?!"`
`"......I am aware that this will be rude if she is there.`
` .........And in any case,`
` ...if {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama has nothing to do with this, she just has to explain herself so that we can believe her."`
`"Tha‐......that's right, exactly!!`
` Give it here!"`
`Jessica snatched the master key from Kanon's hand, and violently shoved it into the keyhole.`
`...Immediately, there was a light sound and she felt it unlock.`
`And without excusing herself, she flung open the door.`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` Where are you?!`
` Show yourself!!"`
`Jessica rudely barged into the room.`
`{n}...The witch wasn't anywhere to be seen.`
`"...Bitch!!`
` She's not here!!`
` Where the hell did she go?!"`
`".........She, she doesn't appear to be here, does she..."`
`Jessica, thinking that she might be hiding somewhere inside the room, peeked behind the curtains and under the bed, but she couldn't find anyone.`
`However, there definitely were signs that the bed had been used,`
` ......and although it's an odd way to say it, the atmosphere in the room had grown a little softer.`
`It wasn't the hard atmosphere of a place normally devoid of people, like the chapel.`
`{n}You could definitely tell that someone had spent the night in this room.`
`But she could not be seen.`
`In reality, neither Jessica nor Gohda had met {f:5:Beatrice} yet.`
`...They had only been told by those who had met her that she was the spitting image of the person in the portrait.`
`...So they were doubtful about what her face really looked like.`
`...However, Kanon alone had met her.`
` And he understood what kind of being that witch was, ......and what kind of character she had.`
`So he knew that if they were to force their way in here searching for her, she wouldn't let things go as they planned.`
`......She must be watching us bitterly flail about in vain from somewhere, sneering at us.`
` ......She's that kind of person.`
`Because he was looking at things that way, Kanon was the first to find it.`
` ...The other two were concentrating on finding the shape of a person, so they hadn't noticed.`
`Near a water jug on the side table, there was a single sheet of writing paper.`
` It was accompanied by a short message and a fountain pen which had probably been used to write it...`
`Kanon understood the witch.`
` The witch would definitely ridicule them, as they found the six corpses, forced their way in here in rage, and were unable to find her.`
`......Ridicule has no meaning unless it is communicated.`
`{n}So in other words, ...this was definitely...that...!`
`"......Milady.`
` .........There's something written here."`
`"Written, what?!"`
`Jessica quickly dashed over and violently stole the piece of paper.`
`......She probably wasn't trying to be violent.`
`{n}...She just couldn't control her strength now.`
`".........What...?!`
` She's, she's {i:mocking} me?!!"`
`As soon as she read the message, Jessica went into a wild rage, crumpled the paper up, and threw it.`
`Then, she grabbed a table lamp that was by the side of the bed and violently swung it around, mercilessly hitting the walls and furniture with it.`
`...The lightbulb shattered at once, and scattered its shards across the room.`
`"Milady, please calm yourself...!`
` You'll hurt yourself!!"`
`"Let go!!`
` Damn it, damn it!`
` Show yourself, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` How could you do that to Mom and Dad!!`
` Are you that damn scared of me?!`
` I'll kill you, I'll kill you!!`
` Come out so I can beat you to death!!!`
` I told you to let go of me, damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`This was written on the paper...`
`{e:070:―Did you think I'd waste my time waiting comfortably in this place for you to barge in here?`
` You're too wild to be suitable for this intellectual night.`
` What kind of faces must your parents have had after raising you to be such a hapless fool?`
` Yeah, I saw them, they had perfectly stupid faces just like you.`
` Now they are in Candyland with their bellies all full!}`
`......It sounded like something that witch would write...`
` ......It meant that she had predicted that one of the children who had lost their parents would come running in here.`
`...If she was hiding somewhere in this room, she would surely be rolling around with laughter...`
`The witch was that kind of person.`
`{n}...She sneered at people's misfortune, using it to stave off the boredom of a thousand years...!`
`"Hand it over...!`
` I am telling you that you will hurt yourself...!`
` .........nnnnn, ......nnnn!!"`
`"I said let go!!`
` Damn iiiiiit, damn iiiiiiit!!`
` ......au!"`
`Gohda grabbed the table lamp Jessica had been swinging around and took it from her.`
`...Because if she kept swinging it around, she might hit something and get injured.`
`...To Gohda's eyes, Jessica probably looked mad with rage, burning with the flames of anger.`
`......But Kanon's eyes saw it differently.`
`Those were probably...tears of sadness...hidden by rage...`
`Therefore.`
`When, at the moment the table lamp was taken from her,`
` Jessica dropped to the floor almost as if groveling, and started crying and scratching at the carpet...`
`......Gohda was surprised, but Kanon was not.`
`......Her way of crying by brandishing her anger had been stolen from her, ...so this was inevitable.`
`"Uuuuuuuuuuughhh, waaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaa!!`
` Mom......Dad......uwaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}auuu{0}u{0}u{0}uuuu!!"`
`...Considering that she was a daughter of the Ushiromiya main family, ...she was in a very shabby state.`
`......She scratched at the carpet with her fingernails, and even her feet writhed and scratched at it.`
`Jessica cried very, very hard.`
` ...Because if she didn't, her rage would start building up again, and swallow her up.`
`But over and over again, she remembered that letter's humiliating message...`
` ......What kind of faces must your parents have had after raising you to be such a hapless fool?`
`"They aren't stupid!!`
` Both Mom and Dad were smart!!`
` They weren't like me, they were really smart!!`
` They aren't stupid!`
` Take it back,`
` take it back!!"`
`Yeah, I saw them, they had perfectly stupid faces just like you.`
`{n}Now they are in Candyland with their bellies all full!!`
`"Ooooooooooooooohhh, damn iiiiiit!!`
` I'll kill her I'll kill her, I'll slice her stomach and make her meet the same end!!`
` Uuuuaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaa, waaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaa......!!!`
` Hic, *cough*cough*, *cough*cough*cough*!!!"`
`As Jessica cried and screamed, she triggered an asthma attack...`
` The servants watching over her ran up to her hurriedly and rubbed her back, but that only provoked Jessica's wrath...`
`"*cough*cough*!!`
` 'the hell!!`
` If you have the time to do that, search for that bitch!!`
` Find her and bring her to me!!"`
`"If you won't go, then I will!!`
` And I'll kill her with my own hands, I'll slice her stomach!!"`
`"*cough*cough*cough*cough*!!`
` *cough*, *cough*!!`
` Don't touch me!!!`
` Fucker...fucker, *cough*cough*!!`
` *cough*cough*!!"`
`Jessica got up unsteadily, and as her asthma continued, she went out into the hallway...`
`"Milady, your medicine, quickly...!`
` I will call Doctor Nanjo!"`
`"...............Gohda‐san.`
` .........Would you...leave this to me?"`
`Kanon had noticed.`
` .........Gohda, who was much older, ...probably couldn't feel the tears in Jessica's heart.`
`......Kanon, who had noticed that himself, had to support her.`
`"K‐Kanon‐san.`
` ............Is that alright...?"`
`".........I believe that Milady needs some time to cry for now.`
` ............After seeing her parents, when they were killed like that..."`
`".................................`
` ...You're right."`
`Gohda also understood.`
` ......And he also knew of the modest relationship that Jessica and Kanon shared.`
`So he understood everything, and left it to Kanon.`
`".........I understand.`
` ......I will go back to Rosa‐sama.`
` ...Please, take care of Milady."`
`"Yes.`
` ......Leave it to me."`
`Kanon's voice was frail, ......but he nodded forcefully.`
`{n}After looking at his eyes, Gohda also nodded forcefully.`
`...Gohda was a veteran with many years behind him.`
` He had seen a great number of people in his life.`
` ...So he knew of the vigorous sparkle that could be found in the eyes of those who had self‐control.`
`He had seen that clearly in Kanon's eyes.`
`{n}......Therefore, he would leave this to Kanon.`
`...Thinking about it, this may have been the first moment that Gohda had trusted Kanon and relied on him for a job...`
`It seemed Jessica was heading towards her room, ...leaning against the wall as she suffered from her asthma.`
`......Kanon followed after her wordlessly.`
`If she had asked for a hand, he would have jumped over and supported her.`
` ...But as long as Jessica didn't ask for that, he hid himself, watching over her from a distance where he could come to her rescue at any time.`
`......As Kanon remained in that spot where ten billion people would hope for someone else to be when their hearts felt like they would explode from sadness,`
` he silently watched Jessica's back...`
`Then, finally, she was crouching in front of the door to her own room.`
`......The asthma attack had stolen all of her strength.`
` And her thoughts had gotten hazy from the lack of oxygen, so that she could no longer stand up.`
`......But right now, Jessica wasn't thinking that she wanted someone to lend a hand.`
` Because she still hadn't been able to overcome the flames of anger.`
`...Because even if someone had offered her a hand with good intentions, right now, Jessica would start wanting to grab it and lacerate it.`
`...And she understood how unreasonable that would be.`
` ...Until she could overcome the flames of her anger, she definitely wouldn't ask for help.`
`Probably, Jessica no longer even had the willpower to call for help.`
`......But Kanon heard it.`
` ...He definitely heard it.`
`......Kanon definitely heard that voiceless call for help, which is shared by those from across the world who are grieving, and which, though they scream and scream, cannot be heard by anyone.`
`Kanon softly knelt by Jessica's side, and wordlessly offered her a shoulder.`
`......Even as Jessica kept coughing painfully, she accepted it,`
` .........unlocked her room, and entered...`
`"............This way.`
` ...............I'll prepare your medicine right away."`
`"..................*cough*cough*cough*...!`
` .........*co.........*cough*cough*cough*...!!"`
`Jessica had often said that when she let her asthma run its course, it hurt so badly that it felt like she would vomit her whole stomach.`
`Her face was pale, and her gaze wavered.`
`{n}And yet, the coughing continued...`
`......Even so, ...her sadness was probably even stronger...`
`After having her sit on the bed, Kanon took an inhaler from a cute basket on a side table by the bed, and handed it to her.`
`......Jessica sometimes forgot to walk around with her medicine.`
`When it seemed that this was the case, Kanon would take notice and secretly carry around the inhaler from the first‐aid kit in the servant room, but he hadn't done so today.`
`......He scolded himself, as though wondering how, after failing to bring it with him on a day like this, he could call himself furniture.`
`.........Then he remembered the day when he had spoken that word, and somehow betrayed Jessica's feelings, ...which jarred Kanon's heart,`
` ......but compared to Jessica's current sadness, he thought of that as a far more shameless emotion, and he suppressed it to the depths of his heart...`
`".........haah.........haah...`
` .....................haah..."`
`When she inhaled her medicine, Jessica's wild breathing calmed down bit by bit, ...and she was finally able to regain her composure.`
`.........But the strength and willpower she had lost wouldn't allow her to rise up from the bed.`
`".....................Are you alright?`
` ......Milady."`
`"............I'm...`
`......alright...`
` .........I'm all messed up over Mom and Dad,`
` .........but,`
` ......after I cry a little longer,`
` .........I'll be alright............"`
`"........................"`
`Kanon regretted misspeaking.`
`......He had said "Are you alright", to her?`
`{n}...Was he really unable to notice the pain in her heart?`
`............This was why he was, ultimately, mere furniture.`
`{n}This was why he couldn't become human...`
`"..................I will be in the corridor.`
` ...If you need anything, please call me immediately."`
`Kanon understood that she still needed some time to cry alone.`
`He told her to call him at any time, bowed, and made to leave the room.`
`"......ah, ..............."`
`"......Is there something?"`
`Jessica had spoken as though she wanted him to stop, so Kanon had stopped.`
`.........If she asks it, I'll do anything to help her.`
`...If it could heal the pain in her heart, right now, I would even become a cane or a chair.`
`.........If by doing that, ......I can repair the pain in her heart I gave her that day...`
`".........................................."`
`...For a while, Jessica stared into Kanon's eyes.`
`{n}......As though, despite stopping him, she had nothing to say.`
`"................................."`
`"..........................."`
`For a while, neither spoke.`
` ............Jessica broke that silence.`
` ...With a small voice.`
`".........Sorry.`
` .........It's nothing.`
` ...............Could you tell Auntie Rosa that I want to be alone for a while...?"`
`"I won't...let you be alone."`
`"........................huh..."`
`"I won't let you...be alone.`
` ..................So, I will be in the corridor.`
` ...At any time,`
` ......call me."`
`For just an instant, it looked like some kind of hope flew to Jessica's eyes.`
`...But it was very faint, ...and disappeared like the first snow does on the surface of a river.`
`"......Thanks.`
` ..................For just a while, let me cry alone..."`
`"............Yes.`
` ...............Excuse me."`
`Kanon bowed once again, and closed the door...`
`.........He thought he had said something to give her some courage.`
`{n}............But for some reason, it felt like that had actually hurt her.`
`...Why?`
` .........He didn't know.`
`{n}......Surely, that was because...`
`...............he was furniture.`
`So even now, ...he couldn't grasp human sadness.`
`As Kanon repeatedly questioned himself, he walked down the corridor.`
` .........He felt like the window at the end was coolly calling to him.`
`"..............................`
` ......In the end, .........am I nothing more than furniture after all......?"`
`It was still pouring outside—a dark, gray world.`
`...Even on days like this, Shannon would surely look at the ocean and know it was blue.`
`......But to my eyes, even if it cleared up, I would only see gray...`
`As long as I cannot tell the blueness of the ocean,`
` ......I am nothing but furniture imitating a person.........`
`".....................You really don't understand a woman's heart.`
` ...In times like that, you should silently remain by her side.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*, that's why you're furniture."`
`"Y‐............you―"`
`There shouldn't have been a trace of anyone in this corridor.`
`{n}It had been empty and cold.`
`{n}.........But those scoffing words approached Kanon from behind.`
`When he turned around, ......he saw that witch.`
`{n}That witch, who hadn't shown herself when Jessica had searched for her with a rage bordering on madness—who had left that sneering letter to toy with her...!`
`"There are three ways to hurt a woman.`
` ...Let me teach them, just for you.`
` One is to hurt them with a knife.`
` Another is to hurt them in their heart."`
`"...And the last one is the most difficult, and the most effective way of hurting them.`
` And yet it can hurt them without you even realizing it.`
` Do you know what it is...?"`
`"How, ......how could I know, I don't even want to know!!"`
`"It is to betray their hopes.`
` ......No living being is more of a dreamer than a woman!`
` They dream by themselves, and hurt by themselves.`
` ......A distant man like you hurts women the most!`
` You couldn't understand.`
` You don't have a clue how much you have injured Jessica."`
`"......Because you're furniture!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"I, I have no intention of going along with your nonsense!`
` ......Did you appear only to sneer at me?!!"`
`"Don't be so full of yourself, furniture.`
` You aren't worth sneering at!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Still, even though you may not be worth it alone, if the two of you are gathered, that's more than enough.`
` ......I never get tired of the pleasure that comes from laughing at the fate of a young couple."`
`"What did you say...`
` .........Y‐`
`...you aren't thinking...`
` ......Not Milady......"`
`"I need "two who are close" as sacrifices for the second twilight.`
` ...The two of you truly are convenient...!!"`
`"W‐......wait...!`
` Don't misunderstand......!`
` Milady and I...`
`...don't have that kind of relationship...!`
` We can't become the sacrifices for the second twilight!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` That's why you hurt Jessica.`
` That's why you cannot become human...!!"`
`"Very well, then, if you won't admit that you have feelings for Jessica, I can accept that.`
` ......But I'll kill Jessica!!"`
`"Why?!"`
`"You idiot!!`
` Isn't it obvious?!!"`
`"{i:It'll be fun to kill her and see the pained look on your face, why else}?!!"`
`"Following the rules of the ritual, I will arbitrarily select thirteen people as sacrifices.`
` However, there's no rule saying that I can't kill any more."`
`"...If I think it's fun, I can kill any number of people!!`
` So I will kill!!`
` {i:Make me laugh as hard as I can}, alright furrrrnituuuure, Kanonnnnnnnn?!?!"`
`At that time, Kanon definitely heard Jessica's scream.`
`The instant he blinked and looked down the corridor, the witch, who had been there making a perfectly ordinary face until a second ago, had disappeared.`
`...Right now, it was just him, standing alone in the corridor.`
`......And the person he wanted to protect was asking for help, and was right over there.`
`It was obvious what he should do.`
`{n}It wasn't logical.`
` It was an electric reaction.`
`{n}Without a trace of hesitation or idle thoughts.`
`...The person he wanted to protect was there, and asking for help.`
` .........So, in that moment, he genuinely felt that he wanted to be the person who was there with her.`
`When he flew into Jessica's room, his eyes latched on to a bizarre scene.`
`The room was a fantastical world, where a blizzard of golden powder danced, almost as though gold leaf had been scattered inside a snow globe.`
`.........No, that's not it.`
`{n}I've seen this spectacle before.`
`{n}This isn't gold leaf.`
`......It's countless gold butterflies—{f:5:Beatrice}'s minions!!`
`Jessica was surrounded by countless butterflies, and was waving her hands around, trying frantically to bat them away.`
`"Milady!!!"`
`"Ka‐Kanon‐kun......`
` H‐help...............`
` ...*cough*cough*cough*cough*!!"`
`Kanon rushed towards Jessica, and violently brushed the group of butterflies away.`
`...The butterflies, beautiful yet filthy, surrounded Jessica's face, trying to crawl in through her mouth and nose.`
`Jessica gagged violently.`
`...Almost as though the butterflies were triggering her asthma attack, sneering at her.`
`Indeed, when Kanon ran towards Jessica as she choked, the butterflies stopped attacking her, and this time, they began to elegantly dance a rondo around the two.`
`".........Kanon‐kun...... Kanon‐kun........."`
`"...It's alright.`
` ............While there's still life in my eyes,`
` ......I won't let anyone lay a finger on you."`
`".........Show yourself, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` Are you satisfied now?!!"`
`As he guarded Jessica, in pain and using her inhaler, Kanon yelled into the empty air.`
`......When he did, the empty air definitely laughed back, satisfied.`
`...Then, she showed herself.`
`{n}It wasn't in response to Kanon's demand.`
`It was obviously because appearing and sneering humiliated them even more, and was more fun!`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*hahahahaha!!`
` Now everything follows the plot.`
` Now you are carp on the chopping board."`
`"No, since the two of you are together, should I call it {c:86EF9C:duck with green onions}?`
` Hahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"Y‐......you,`
` ......B‐{f:5:Beatrice}...!!"`
`"Please, stand back.`
` ......I'll protect you, Milady...!"`
`"It's essential that the witch appears when the princess and the knight are together.`
` ......Come now, won't you show me how much power Kinzo's furniture holds?"`
`She snapped her fingers and there was a piercing sound.`
`When she did, a blizzard of gold butterflies started up, and they began to form a small mountain as they whirled around in a circle.`
`...Just like how a cold, wintry wind swirls and creates a mountain of leaves.`
`From that mound of gold, a hand sprouted, ...and it appeared, ......as though a resident of the world below was crawling out.`
`"Wh‐.........what is this......?`
` What's going on......?!"`
`Jessica couldn't comprehend what she was seeing right now, and her mouth kept flapping open and closed...`
`It was a literal attempt to take in and digest knowledge—to understand the incomprehensible.`
`That which was crawling up......was probably an attendant serving the witch.`
`It appeared to be wearing a uniform following the pattern of those who serve.`
`......But its face was different.`
` It was...strange‐looking...`
`......It was covered with pitch‐black hair, ...it breathed rotten breath, and its eyes were filled with the same strange subterranean glow as lava.`
`...And.........the symbol of those who are not human—a pair of horns...`
` It was the figure of a goat‐faced attendant who served the witch......`
`"...........................!!!!!"`
`Jessica could no longer decide what to say.`
`...All this happening in front of her couldn't be explained with this world's common sense, and she couldn't do anything except open and close her mouth.`
`......Jessica hadn't noticed.`
` ...That this island had already been cut off from the rules of this world.`
`But even so, she could understand.`
` ......That this goat attendant was the witch's familiar, ......and it was after her life.`
`And it seemed that the witch had already ordered that.`
`{n}And she faced Kanon with an expectant gaze.`
`......She faced him with a provocative gaze filled with expectation, as though asking him how he planned to protect this maiden!`
`The attendant had looked especially like a beast when it had been crawling up, but in its composure,`
` you could see that it had more than enough dignity to be worthy of serving the Golden Witch.`
`......And you could tell that it was overflowing with the joy of furniture wanting to meet its master's expectations.`
`".........Why don't you show me?`
` The power of Kinzo's furniture!"`
`"Don't get it wrong again... Understand?`
` ......Don't forget that you're furniture...`
` If you continue acting like a human even now, this won't be settled by your death alone.`
` Kukikiki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}kikiki!"`
`The goat attendant made a gesture that seemed to be a silent bow.`
`{n}Was that in response to its master, ...or was it offered to the opposing Kanon?`
`Then, on the attendant's hand, ......a blade of wicked malice appeared......`
`".........Wh‐`
`............what is...`
`......that............"`
`Jessica had been unable to understand what was happening in front of her for a while now.`
`......All she understood......was that this thing was gleaming for the purpose of threatening her own life.`
`And right now, that was enough.`
`Kanon spoke quietly to Jessica, who was hiding behind his back.`
`".........Milady.`
` ...Please stay back, against the wall.`
` ...Never let your back leave the wall."`
`"Wha......?!"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` The maiden should obediently hide behind the great knight's back.`
` Relish to the full the pleasure of having a man protect your own life.`
` ......Come!`
` Kanon, show me your blade!!"`
`"................................."`
`"......Beautiful.`
` ...At least when it comes to giving birth to furniture, Kinzo might reach up to my feet."`
`"...Something like this......can't even be used to trim the roses."`
`"...............K‐.........Kanon‐kun...`
` ...............What is........."`
`".........I didn't want...to show you."`
`"So you had the courage to draw your blade.`
` .........How does it feel to have exposed the fact that you are a subhuman being in front of the girl you have feelings for?"`
`"........................Shut up."`
`"......Hmph.`
` ......So you feign composure even though you're really burning with wrath?`
` ...I see, they say that truly hot flames burn a cool blue.`
` Is that how you are now?"`
`"There's no way I can kill you with my powers.`
` ......You are the moon.`
` There's no way I can smash the moon by throwing a rock.`
` ......However, in order to manifest yourself, you had to reflect your image on the surface of the water."`
`"If you throw a rock at the surface of the water, you might be able to disturb the moon for some time.`
` ...But that doesn't mean the moon has been smashed.`
` So."`
`"......Until this life of mine is over,`
` ......I'll keep on striking your reflection......!"`
`"I like it, Kanon!!`
` Begin, furniture!!"`
`"............Hoh.`
` ...............A beautiful trail."`
`The witch's words of admiration broke the silence, and for just an instant, broke Jessica's paralysis.`
`"..............................`
` Am,`
` ......am I...`
`...dreaming.........?"`
`"............Come,`
` furniture of the witch.`
` .........I'll beat you down to the hell you came from."`
`"................................."`
`A strand of red remained on Kanon's cheek.`
`{n}...The witch saw this and grinned broadly...`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` ......You may mutter excuses about not being on your game if you wish?"`
`"........................"`
`"K‐......Kanon‐kun, ............stay strong...!"`
`".........It's alright.`
` .........I...won't die yet."`
`The trail drawn by the goat attendant's blade......drew a large arc in empty space.`
`...Kanon...wasn't there.`
`{n}......He was behind it.`
`".........Back whither you came, and await your master.`
` ......Die."`
`If this battle of drawing sparkling trails was chess...`
`{n}...then Kanon coming from behind was check.`
`And press, and press, and press, and press.`
`{n}And mate in seven...!`
`......Had the goat attendant not even been given the right to go into death throes?`
`......As its knees buckled and it fell over, it crumbled softly into a bunch of gold butterflies...`
`So there was no sound of it hitting the ground.`
` Even those who couldn't understand this battle...could definitely at least realize that Kanon had been magnificent.`
`"......Hmph.`
` So it couldn't win against one handmade.`
` ...It seems that you aren't so pathetic."`
`"You're next, .........{f:5:Beatriceeeeeeeee}!!"`
`Kanon's blade sliced diagonally through the witch's form like a hot knife through butter, and in that instant, she burst into gold and scattered.`
`......She scattered into several thousand gold butterflies, and for just an instant, the room was filled with the color of twilight.`
`...It was just as Kanon himself had said.`
` Attempting to slice {f:5:Beatrice} was just the same as slicing the surface of the water where the moon was reflected.`
`...The witch's form was there, with an ordinary expression on her face, as though she had been there the whole time, ...behind Kanon.`
`"Hahahahahahaha...!!`
` It was quite an interesting show.`
` In deference to that, I was going to let you get away, but now your rudeness has caused me to change my mind..."`
`"Don't lie!`
` I won't let you kill Milady!!`
` ......Even if that's impossible, ......I won't let you kill her before me!"`
`"You can't even do that much.`
` Speak not, furniture.`
` Be silent, furniture.`
` Know your place, furniture!!"`
`"K‐.........Kanon‐kun isn't furniture...!"`
`"......Hoh.`
` ...And why do you say that?"`
`"I don't need a reason.`
` ......Kanon‐kun is Kanon‐kun."`
`"No, his real name is different, ......but a name doesn't make him furniture!`
` Kanon‐kun has his own way of living.`
` That's a very noble thing, and it's up to him to decide."`
`"......Saying he can't have an opinion because he's furniture, or can't have his own life because he's furniture......that's all just crap!!"`
`"Milady... You mustn't provoke her."`
`"No, I'm gonna say this clearly.`
` .........Kanon‐kun isn't furniture.`
` He's human.`
` ......Why?"`
`"Kanon‐kun rushed to save me of his own will.`
` And he stood in the path of you, a fearsome witch.`
` Even though he had many chances to just abandon me, he didn't."`
`".........Self‐sacrifice is part of the noble spirit that only humans have!!`
` So Kanon‐kun is human!!`
` So take it back!`
` Don't ever call Kanon‐kun furniture again!!"`
`".........Mila...dy........."`
`"Hmph.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` ...Kuhahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha.`
` Wahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"Don't speak, human!!`
` Let us end this quickly; after all, this is only the second twilight.`
` Now, I will sacrifice "the two who are close", who accept each other's dignity."`
`"Come, arise, forgive the sin, one of the seven stakes of Purgatory, lust!!!"`
`The witch summoned her own furniture with a mixture of laughter and anger on her face.`
`"......Asmodeus the Lustful.`
` Right here."`
`"I've had enough of this farce.`
` Quickly, execute the second twilight.`
` ......Do not permit me to blink thrice."`
`"......As you command."`
`"A‐......another weirdo's shown up......"`
`"...........................kh..."`
`It took Kanon less than an instant to understand.`
` ......That goat‐face from a second ago had been nothing more than a pawn to the witch.`
`However, there was a marked difference in the value of this piece, of this furniture that had been newly summoned.`
`"......How lucky am I, to be granted such gorgeous prey.`
` .........*giggle*giggle*giggle*, you scared?`
` How cuuute.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"............Come,`
` furniture of the witch...`
` I won't be killed by you...!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*!`
` You're acting pretty smart for a slowpoke who can't even follow my moves."`
`"......Here I come...`
` ......Hey hey, where do you want it?`
` Where do you want me to pierce you?`
` Answer me, cutie boy.`
` Wherever you want it, I'll run you through hard...!!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*, come on, answer me, cutie...!"`
`"D‐...don't call me cute!!!"`
`"Kyahahahahaha!!`
` Here I come, slowpoke!!`
` Come on, try to follow me, you blind idiot!!`
` Kyaahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"Ugnhh......!!"`
`"............Mi‐......Milady........."`
`"Heh, .........I couldn't follow it with my eyes...`
` But my guess...was spot on.........`
` Serves you...right............"`
`Kanon's back had been the target.`
`{n}...But Jessica had predicted it.`
`She had predicted that the sneering witch's target would be the complete opposite of fair and honest—his back.`
`But she had no way to block it.`
`{n}...She had no aspirations to martyrdom.`
`{n}She simply thought that there was no way other than this to protect Kanon's back.`
`............So, she could do nothing but block it with her own back.`
`The furniture of the witch, which had changed its form into a demon's stake, was stuck deep into Jessica's back.`
` ...It was an obviously fatal wound that reached as far as her lungs.`
`When she saw this, the witch let out a loud, evil laugh.`
`Because it had hit {i:where the witch had predicted}.`
`{n}...Everything, everything was as the witch had predicted!`
`"What's wrong Kanonnn...?`
` I thought "Milady Jessica" wasn't going to be killed before you??"`
`"Kukikikikiki, yes, yes, that's it, that's it, that face, that look on your face is what I wanted to see!!`
` Kikiki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}kikiki!!`
` This has been fun, more than enough of it!!`
` Enough now, die, die, make me laugh!!"`
`"Come, arise, forgive the sin,`
` one of the seven stakes of Purgatory,`
` wrath!!"`
`"......Satan the Wrathful.`
` Right here."`
`"The prey is yours.`
` Eat him right now, and close the curtain on his stage."`
`"......If you were a human, I'd say it's time for you to step down, but since you're furniture, maybe I should say it's time for the stage manager to carry you behind the stage!"`
`"..................I am not......furniture anymore.`
` I won't......doubt that again!"`
`"......*giggle*giggle*, ohh?`
` You're gonna be killed by me again?"`
`"Your chest, ......it's so warm, and it feels so good to stick myself in there, you know...?`
` Come on, let me have another taste...`
` Make me feel real good with that hot, hot, fresh blood in that warm chest of yours..."`
`"...Kyahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!"`
`"Ghh......!!"`
`There was no way to block it.`
`The sound of a woodpecker filled the entire room,`
` ...and before he could blink,`
` ......it was already right in the center of his chest...`
`When you take a piece in chess, it's impossible by the rules for your opponent's piece to defend.`
`So this was an obvious result, and one even specified by the rules.`
`Kanon landed on his knees...`
` And he apologized.`
`......Not to the witch.`
` ...And not to "Milady".`
`.........He apologized...to Jessica.`
`"...Sorry............`
` ......I couldn't......protect you............"`
`".........Don't worry about it......`
` ......You were really...cool......"`
`Kanon finally fell over.`
` ......He landed next to Jessica, and the two lay there like Gemini.`
`"......You know, Kanon‐kun,`
` .........you aren't...furniture anymore..."`
`"...Yes......`
` .........I was...`
`...too late...`
`...in realizing that......"`
`"I wanted to ask you...`
`.........what your real name was..."`
`"...My...`
`......real name is...`
`............`
`......ah...`
`.........aaaaaaaaah...ah..."`
`In his last moments, Kanon wanted to tell her his real name.`
` ...But...Jessica had already fallen into a sleep from which she would never wake......`
`So, Kanon's real name, which he had protected until today,`
` .........in the end,`
` ...he couldn't......tell it to Jessica...`
`".........I...`
`............became...`
`.........hu...ma........."`
`Those were...the last words Kanon left behind.`
`"Wahahahahahahahahaha, kukikaka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}kakaka!!`
` Don't make me laugh, furniture!!"`
`"Even after a hundred years, furniture is furniture!`
` Have you ever heard of an idiot who'll dig a grave for furniture when they throw it away?`
` You smash furniture to pieces and make firewood, so all that's left is ashes!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle, that's how it is, no tombstone can be carved for furniture!`
` ......It seems you believe that when you die, you cannot receive any more humiliation, but that's naive, you see...?`
` I'll teach you......what it really means to disgrace the dead.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!!"`
`After taking a puff from her pipe, the witch breathed the smoke at Kanon's corpse...`
`......When she did, Kanon's corpse softly floated up into the air, ...and disappeared as though it had been eaten by a mouth in empty space.`
`The witch played dirty until the very end.`
` ......The two who had understood one another in their last moments—she would not even permit their corpses to be close...`
`If someone had been watching, they would probably mourn that this was indeed a disgrace to the dead.`
`...However, {f:5:Beatrice} was far, far crueler...`
`{n}......That would become immediately apparent...`
`"............I see.`
` So it has begun."`
`"...Yes."`
`"................................."`
`Even though Kinzo had heard of the six deaths, his emotions did not waver.`
`The expression on his face as he gazed out the window......was a smile, as though his opponent in a chess game had just made a spectacular move.`
`...It was unimaginable that this expression could appear on a father who had lost many children at once.`
`"......Under Rosa‐sama's orders, Gohda and Kanon are calling the police.`
` Also, she has ordered us to follow your orders, my lord...`
` ......What shall we do?"`
`"...............This island has already been cut off from the real world.`
` Phones and the like will be useless."`
`"Should I have them stop?"`
`"......Until the roulette is finished, what they do to pass the time is up to them.`
` Let them do as they like."`
`"............Yes."`
`"...Umm......`
`...what should I tell Rosa‐sama?"`
`"I say again, what they do to pass the time is up to them!!`
` They can sing if they want, dance if they want!`
` They're even free to hang themselves by the neck or jump into a boiling cauldron!!`
` Until thirteen people die, they can spend their time as they like.`
` If they are that bored, then they can spend their time wondering why six times nine is forty‐two!!`
` That's the answer to the mystery of man and the universe!!"`
`"Y‐yes...!`
` My, my apologies......!"`
`Shannon cowered in fright at this sudden rage.`
` ...Genji made a gesture as though telling her not to say too much.`
`Shannon couldn't help but regret speaking out of turn...`
`"However.`
` ...You are also free to do as you wish.`
` ......Genji.`
` And Shannon.`
` You have done well serving me until today."`
`"Y‐...your words are too good for me......`
` ...But, umm........."`
`"...............We are furniture who have sworn to serve you, my lord.`
` ......At any and all times, we will be waiting by your side.`
` ......Until the very end."`
`"..................`
` ............I want to tell the two of you...`
`......about everything.`
` ......Shannon.`
` I shall be writing a will.`
` Please copy what I say.`
` ...Genji, please, my usual drink."`
`"huh...`
` ...............Ye‐............yes......!"`
`Nanjo had often recommended that Kinzo write a will because of his health, but each time, Kinzo had gone mad with rage.`
`......Since that time, "will" had been the word Kinzo took most exception at.`
`Because that word had come out of his own mouth, Shannon couldn't help doubting her ears for an instant.`
`Shannon hurriedly prepared the side table and some writing paper.`
` Genji also began preparing his usual green devil, just as he was ordered...`
`"I am ready."`
`".........Hmm.`
` .........Where should I start from?`
` ...I suppose I could also speak of my life.`
` ......It would be fun to leave a record of my memorable games."`
`".........It truly is fun to read the records of old games from over a century ago, ...a journey searching for those players' thoughts.`
` .........Then will the score sheet of my life also beckon those in the future to go on a journey searching for my thoughts?`
` ......Hmph."`
`For a while, Kinzo considered where he should start speaking from, striding all around the room with his hands behind his back...`
`"My lord.`
` .........Here."`
`"Good.`
` Thank you, my friend.`
` ............Well then.`
` If I am to speak of my life, I must begin writing from when I met that witch."`
`"...Shannon, copy this.`
` ......My meeting with {f:5:Beatrice} took place a long way back.`
` What year of the Showa era was it...?`
` ...I think it was toward the end of the war—"`
`We took enough time to regain our calm,`
` .........and we each swore to our parents that we'd definitely catch the killer.`
`It would be a lie to say we weren't still bitter.`
`...Even now, if we gave in just a little, we'd feel like going on a rampage like Jessica, and resorting to some kind of violence.`
`According to what Gohda‐san said after he got back, right now, Kanon‐kun was looking after Jessica.`
`...Apparently, she was still very emotionally high‐strung.`
`"......I see.`
` Thank you.`
` ...Maybe a young kid would be better at understanding a young kid's feelings.`
` ......It would probably be better if we left them alone for now."`
`"Rosa‐san...`
` ......There is nothing more we can accomplish by remaining here.`
` ......The telephones may not be working, but tomorrow the boat will come, and we should be able to reach the police.`
` We should leave this place as it is for the police's investigation."`
`"...I agree with Doctor Nanjo.`
` ......It is bad for your health to stay in a place like this for too long.`
` ......Let us return and make some black tea..."`
`".........Yes.`
` ...I'm all for that too.`
` ......Battler‐kun, George‐kun, are you ready...?`
` Let's close this place up.`
` We should leave this place as it is, for when the police come if nothing else."`
`"You're right.`
` .........Battler‐kun, ...are you alright...?"`
`"......Yeah.`
` ...I've cried all I can.`
` .........I'm fine now."`
`The police would surely find some evidence from a thorough investigation.`
` ...But we hadn't been adult enough to wait for that.`
`...I had investigated the chapel in my own way, trying to catch the culprit before the police got here.`
`......And what I figured out was—frustratingly—nothing.`
`{n}......I hadn't been able to find a single hint.`
`"Come on, ......let's go out.`
` ...Maria, we're going.`
` ......Don't keep staring at it...!"`
`"......Uu."`
`"Come, come, Maria‐sama.`
` Let us return...`
` It is cold here."`
`"............Mother, Father.`
` ......Thank you for everything.`
` ...I will definitely become a man who doesn't betray your expectations..."`
`George spoke his last words of farewell to his parents.`
`......After seeing that, Battler followed suit.`
`"...Dad, Kyrie‐san."`
`Taken on their own, their faces...made it look like they were sleeping, ......which made it all the more bitter......`
`".........Forgive me for leaving you in such a chilly place.`
` .........I'll definitely get whoever did this...`
` Definitely..."`
`"......What is......this?`
` What disgusting graffiti...`
` Did the killer draw it?"`
`"It is worse than vulgar......`
` ......This is horrible..."`
`When the door to the chapel was closed, we learned about that creepy graffiti for the first time.`
`"It was like this when we first found it.`
` ...No doubt it was drawn by the culprit..."`
`"...The culprit was a witch, so is this a magic circle to summon a demon or something......?"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihi...`
` This is the seventh magic circle of the sun.`
` You don't even know that, huh...`
` Kihihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi.`
` Ouch."`
`"Hey!!`
` Don't I always tell you not to make that creepy laugh!!"`
`"Maria, go on.`
` ......What does it mean?"`
`"It's a magic circle to escape from physical or mental bonds.`
` ......And the Hebrew written around the circumference says, "The Lord has freed me from my chains.`
` I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call on the name of the Lord"."`
`"......Sacrifice of thanksgiving...?`
` Are you telling me that killing Father and the rest was so that they could be sacrifices for this magic circle...?!"`
`"Calm yourself, George‐kun...!`
` This is the killer trying to provoke us.`
` ...It doesn't mean anything.`
` Just thinking about it poisons the heart."`
`"......And there's some English written.`
` ...<Happy Halloween for>...<Maria>.`
` ......I see.`
` And the key to open this door was handed over to Maria, ...is that what this is?"`
`"...But this is the chapel.`
` ...Maybe "Maria" doesn't mean Maria‐chan, but the Virgin Mary.`
` ......In that case, you could read this as a blasphemy against God, in the name of Halloween."`
`"They say that witches who make contracts with demons swear to always defile God's name.`
` ......In that sense, this really is a witch‐like crime."`
`"...You sure know a lot.`
` ......Did you hear that from Maria?"`
`"......Yeah, something like that."`
`"So, the chapel.`
` ......They went to all the trouble of calling them out to the chapel before killing them...`
` ............Auntie Rosa,`
` does this chapel have some special meaning...?"`
`"What do you mean, ......special meaning?"`
`"Well, umm,`
` ............they carried six human corpses all the way over here, and made these elaborate decorations."`
`"...We can't tell whether she called the six of them over here before killing them, or whether she killed them and then carried them over here,`
` ...but either way, it would take a lot of effort.`
` .........What reason did the culprit have...`
` {i:for wanting six people to die here}......?"`
`"......Yes, that is something.`
` In doing something that elaborate, there would be an extremely high chance that when the police came, some disadvantageous evidence would be found."`
`"......There is no way the culprit failed to notice that.`
` ...Then, why did the culprit go to all the effort of doing this,`
` is the question we face..."`
`"In that case, there's one question that comes out at this point.`
` ......What meaning does this place, where we found the six corpses, have?"`
`"......This chapel......was important to Father.`
` ......I've been strictly told not to enter it since I was a kid."`
`"Uu.`
` ...I came here once too, got yelled at a lot...`
` Uu..."`
`"An important chapel...?`
` ......Does it have some connection to the Ushiromiya main family...?"`
`"I don't know.`
` ......Father viewed this chapel as very sacred, and he treasured it so much that he had it redecorated several times."`
`"...But as you all know,`
` Father simply has a love of black magic—it's not that he was a devout believer.`
` ......I've never heard of him coming here to offer his prayers to God."`
`"......Even to the best of my knowledge, the Master has never come here.`
` We even called this the "forbidden chapel", ...umm,`
` and thought of it as quite eerie, like a haunted house."`
`"Even though Father never approached it himself, for some reason, he made the servants clean it several times a year.`
` ......It felt like he kept it clean all the time so that it could be used at any time."`
`"And even so, it's called the "forbidden chapel"...`
` ......Ihihi!`
` This may be indiscreet, but doesn't that have an interesting ring to it?`
` Doctor Nanjo, you're an old friend of Grandfather's, right?`
` Ever asked him anything about that?"`
`"............I asked about it long ago, but I forget what he said to evade the issue.`
` ......That's right, didn't he say something like this?"`
`"......Someday, he too might be able to receive a blessing there.`
` But unless a miracle occurred, that day would never come."`
`"What does that mean?`
` .........What goes on in a chapel?`
` He couldn't mean his own funeral, right?"`
`"I wouldn't believe that of Kinzo‐san.`
` ...He was a man much more focused on the now, while he still lives, rather than things after death.`
` .........However, it does seem that this was the root of all the complexity in the inheritance problem."`
`"What else is there you do in a chapel?`
` .........Pray?`
` Aren't confessions done in chapels as well?`
` ..................Anyway, it sounds suspicious."`
`"......I don't know the reason,`
` ......but just as Doctor Nanjo said, it seems that in Grandfather's eyes,`
` ......the fact that he wouldn't receive a blessing unless a miracle occurred was a fate set in stone from the time this chapel was constructed."`
`"How can you tell that...?"`
`"See, ...it's clearly written up there.`
` ......Look, up there."`
`George‐aniki pointed to a relief with rusted gold letters on the arch above the door.`
`It looked like some message was written there in English.`
` ...The rust showed that the message had been there since construction.`
`".........I'm bad at English.`
` ......What's it say...?`
` ......<This door is>...{0}<opened>...{0}<only at>...{0}<probability of>??`
` Sorry, my English sucks."`
`I gave up after I was unable to finish reading the first of the two lines.`
`{n}...It looked like the others could read it properly.`
`"...Umm, I think it went "m", "b", "t", "q", so,`
` ...umm, umm... How big was that again... I think...umm...umm,`
` ..............."`
`"......In any case, this is incredible.`
` You couldn't even count close to that with all the fingers on both hands.`
` It really would be impossible unless a miracle occurred."`
`"......Certainly.`
` It is very much like how Kinzo‐san used to talk, when he would tend to relate everything in terms of gambling."`
`"What, what, you could all read it?`
` Someone tell me what it means too."`
`"Kihihihihihihi.`
` ...At least learn English.`
` How did you get into high school without even being able to read this much?`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi,`
` ouch.`
` Ouch`
`ouch`
`ouch."`
`"Mind your own damn business.`
` So what's written there?"`
`"...Roughly it says:`
` "This door is opened only when a miracle occurs.`
` You will be blessed only when a miracle occurs"."`
`"......Grandfather's sorcery is based on astronomically low probabilities.`
` ...In other words, the miracle that would open this door......would probably require an incredibly vast magical power.`
` ......Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi.`
` Ouch."`
`"Niiiice, you can shut up now.`
` Auntie Rosa, you were sending Maria to English classes?`
` I guess it's true, you have to start learning English when you're young."`
`".........The forbidden chapel.`
` ......Whether or not the witch {f:5:Beatrice} really was a witch, she's whispered to have actually existed several decades ago,`
` ......and been Grandfather's mistress."`
`"This is, umm, just my imagination, but...`
`......I imagine the Master really did truly love {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` However, he was already married, so they couldn't be united."`
`"...I see.`
` .........If the dead {f:5:Beatrice} could be revived with the magic of a miracle, then now that Grandmother is dead, he could marry her with his head held high.`
` And he'd marry her in this chapel......... Could it be a fairy‐tale story like that?"`
`"......I don't think that sounds so preposterous.`
` ...It is a well known fact that Father still loves {f:5:Beatrice} deeply."`
`"......Also, even though I said it was creepy,`
` I get the feeling that the interior of the chapel was quite magnificent.`
` .........The thought that Father built this chapel in the hopes of having a wedding with his dead mistress actually might not be that unlikely."`
`"...By the time he built this chapel, Grandfather probably knew that he would never use it as a church as long as he lived."`
`" ......But he prayed for the witch to be revived by some miracle.`
` And he thought that if that miracle occurred, they could be married here..."`
`"......I see.`
` ...If you think of it that way, this would be a place of utmost significance to {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama as well...`
` All the while knowing it was a chapel that would never be opened.`
` ......A story of sad love."`
`Even though Gohda‐san's body was even bigger than mine, his words were touching.`
`...Everyone was silent, but it seemed that they agreed with that view.`
`"Even though he knew it was a chapel never to be opened,`
` ......he still probably dreamed of the day that a miracle would occur.`
` .........Kinzo‐san was a great romantic in his younger days.`
` ...I feel as though I understand him."`
`"Ihihi.`
` I wonder.`
` ......But you all came in four times a year to clean it, right?"`
`"What do you mean, never opened?`
` Didn't we just go in ourselves?`
` That wasn't a miracle or anything.`
` We brought the key, clunk, and we're in.`
` That's all that happened, this is ridiculous."`
`"..................Huh?`
` ............Wha?!`
` ...............Wait, .........what on Earth?"`
`"Wh‐what do you mean "what on Earth"..."`
`I thought all I'd done was mess around because I didn't like the way the atmosphere had turned all sappy.`
` ......But Auntie Rosa had suddenly jumped on me, with a really serious face.`
`Auntie Rosa's face grew increasingly pale.`
` ...She looked at the magic circle on the door, then at her hand, back and forth, back and forth.`
`"Wh‐......what seems to be the matter, Rosa‐sama...?"`
`"Hey, Gohda‐san!`
` The key to this chapel!`
` Didn't Genji‐san say it?`
` {i:He said there was only one}!"`
`".....................Huh?`
` ............"`
`"...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` ...It took you all far too long to notice.`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi..."`
`...When a kid pulls a prank, it sometimes goes unnoticed by the adults, and the kid who did it loses heart.`
`......If one of those pranks catches someone later on, it makes that kid really happy.`
`......Maria's celebration just now looked a lot like that...`
`"...Y‐......yes, that's right.`
` There is only one of those keys.`
` It is the key to the Master's treasured chapel, so there is only one, with no duplicates.`
` ...It is normally kept safe in the key box in the servant room, but..."`
`"That's right.`
` And Genji‐san said that it had gone missing.`
` ......Someone stole it, ......put it in that envelope, and handed it to Maria!`
` And that was yesterday!"`
`"............What...?`
` Wait, but then,`
` .........that makes no sense, doesn't it?"`
`"...That's absurd.`
` .........This is getting strange."`
`"Wh‐what do you all mean...?`
` I don't have a clue what you're talking about..."`
`"Me neither.`
` ......Would someone be so kind as to explain it for us...?"`
`...Gohda and Nanjo's failure to understand definitely wasn't because they were stupid.`
`......They didn't know.`
` ...They didn't know how long the only key to the chapel had been in Maria's hand.`
`"I'm positive!`
` It was locked!!`
` I unlocked it!!`
` Definitely!!"`
`Auntie Rosa kept closing the chapel door, locking it, pulling on it to check the lock, and opening it again.`
`Her face was becoming pale again...`
`"Until I took the key out of Maria's envelope and opened this door,`
` it was definitely locked!!`
` But this key was in the envelope and in Maria's care!`
` And that happened yesterday before noon!!!"`
`".........What did you say........."`
`"But then that's......strange......!"`
`"Yes, it is.`
` .........Maria received the only key from a woman calling herself a witch midday yesterday.`
` In other words, from midday yesterday until this morning, when Auntie Rosa unlocked the door, this chapel was a locked room."`
`".........How did they get those six in here, and then how did they kill them?!"`
`We had been confused by the six deaths.`
` We'd thought that we had figured something out after hearing about that weird magic circle and the history of the chapel.`
`......That had all been a worthless problem!`
`From midday yesterday until this morning, this chapel had been a locked room.`
`{n}But our parents had been with us until last night.`
`How had the culprit opened this door?!`
`{n}And how had they locked it?!`
`"......What are you trying to pull.`
` ...Again?`
` A locked room again?!`
` Are you trying to say that you unlocked it with the power of magic?!!`
` I'm not that stupid!!"`
`"If you tell me to show you how I open locks with my power, then I can show you.`
` ......But that will not make you surrender."`
`"These "explanations with humans" you talk about!`
` The time I fully exhaust those theories of yours will be the time of my victory!!`
` Come now, how will you destroy it?`
` If it was a human, what trick could they have used to defeat it, hmm~?"`
`"It's just like the locked rooms last time.`
` ...Not enough information!!`
` It's impossible to reason like this!`
` Any excuse could be made, any trick could work!!`
` Guessing is useless!"`
`"Ha!`
` That again?`
` There's not enough information so you'll wait and see?`
` The information is uncertain so it's impossible to reason...?`
` Ha, those are always the excuses you humans use to stop thinking.`
` What is this pretense, you lowly human?!"`
`"Are you saying that unless you're like Laplace's demon, you can't even think, you incompetent fool?!!`
` ......And you speak as though a lack of information is disadvantageous to you, when it's actually the complete opposite, you see?"`
`"The more information you're given, the more it will pain you!`
` It will only cause the strength of the compressor squeezing you to increase!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"Hoh, well, in that case, let me say this.`
` It's impossible to verify that this is even a "locked room" in the first place!!`
` If we're talking about demons, I've got one for you as well."`
`"......It's possible to prove that this isn't a locked room.`
` You just have to show how someone could go in or out!"`
`"But it's impossible to prove that it {i:is} a locked room!!`
` You can't deny the endless set of methods of getting in.`
` In other words, this is one of those Devil's Proofs!!`
` The definition of a locked room is in fact impossible to prove!!"`
`"So, after you stop thinking with a lack of information as an excuse, this is what comes next.`
` ......Oh well.`
` If that is your move, then I will accept it.`
` Continue."`
`"First off, it looks like you're trying to say that the chapel is a locked room.`
` ...Just a short while ago, I spent some time looking around in there, and yeah, I really couldn't find any way in or out except for the door."`
`"......But that {i:just means I couldn't find one}—it doesn't prove that it was a locked room!!"`
`"If there was a "hidden door" or something that I wasn't able to find, all your premises are completely blown away!!`
` In other words, whether I'm able to find a hidden door or not, you can never deny a method X by which the locked room could be entered!"`
`"And this method X could be carried out without magic.`
` After all, it's a "hidden door"!`
` I'm sure that in this chapel, there's some hidden door that's impossible to find.`
` So I don't even need to start guessing, and I can say that magic is impossible!!"`
`".........Hohoh, so you use that reasoning.`
` *cackle*cackle*, how naive."`
`"An expected move.`
` Let me make my move in response.`
` ......I have always thought the "locked rooms" that feature in worthless human detective novels to be ridiculous."`
`"Why?`
` Because they're used the wrong way.`
` ......When a "locked room" appears in a detective novel, do you really think that is a locked room?`
` You don't, do you?!"`
`"{i:What trick did they use to make this look like a locked room}!`
` That's what you think."`
`"In other words, out of all the locked‐room murders humanity has built up over a hundred years, not a single one has ever been made complete!!"`
`"Oooh!!`
` That's some talk—mystery fans are pretty scary, you know?!`
` Christie is probably grinding her teeth in her grave!"`
`"Hmph!!`
` But I am different.`
` I have given birth to a true locked room!`
` And I can demonstrate that.`
` Why?`
` Because I am a witch!!"`
`"For the Devil's Proof, all you have to do is bring along a devil to prove it, yes?`
` Well that's convenient—as a witch, devils and demons are my good friends, I'll bring as many as you like!!"`
`"Sounds great!!`
` "Dad and the rest entered the chapel using a hidden door, or were carried in through one"!`
` How do you plan to beat this move?!"`
`"With this.`
` Regardless of whether they were alive or dead,`
` the six definitely entered through the door!!"`
`"Huh?!?!`
` Dumbass!!`
` The door was locked, how'd they do it?!!"`
`"I opened it with magic, and invited them inside!!"`
`"Like hell you did!!`
` I can't accept magic, so there's no way in hell I'll accept that!!`
` You're lying!!`
` That door can open with some trick.`
` Or maybe there's a hidden door—I won't accept any other way!!"`
`"......<Perpetual>!!`
` That's what we call an endless repetition of moves in chess.`
` In our game, both sides denying the basis of each other's claims and failing to advance the discussion is the same as an endless repetition of moves."`
`"......In most games, this would be decided as a draw, but that would terribly dampen the interest of this game!!`
` We will have no draws.`
` In short, you will either accept me and submit to me, or not!!"`
`"At least I agree with you there!!`
` We'll settle this without fail, just as you wish!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` That disposition is good!`
` .........So I had a thought.`
` I think I'll add a new rule to this game between you and me."`
`"A new rule?!`
` ...I'll bet it's a rule that'll give you an advantage, right?!"`
`"Would I do that?`
` I'll give you the thing that people like you never cease to demand.`
` The reason you incompetent fools always stop thinking and then moan about it is "lack of information"!`
` If you are then given information, you start doubting whether the information is true or not by "denying the basis"!"`
`"Aren't those convenient?`
` What clever little words to hide your own incompetence.`
` I shall eliminate those convenient excuses.`
` You should thank me, *cackle*!"`
`"You said they entered through the door, and I denied it, saying that couldn't happen.`
` ......Are you saying that's an evasive answer?"`
`"That's right.`
` So from now on,`
` {p:1:when I speak the truth, I will use red}."`
`"Wh‐what is this......?!`
` Keep explaining!"`
`"No matter what magic move I use,`
` you can always keep running away by repeating "lack of information" and "denying the basis"."`
`"...Even though I would still win in the end that way, it would be extremely boring.`
` ......Because of that, I think I'll give you that "information" and "basis" that you desire."`
`"However, you would probably doubt each word I say.`
` That isn't bad in itself.`
` I also will use every possible move to make you submit.`
` I don't dislike our posture of searching out the best moves against each other."`
`"......But that won't make a game.`
` So I set up this rule."`
`"`
`{p:1:Everything I speak in red is the truth}!`
` There's absolutely no need to doubt it!"`
`"Are you telling me to believe that...?!"`
`"This is a game between you and me.`
` In a game, the rules are sacred!!`
` Those who take them lightly are not qualified to play!!"`
`"Alright, I got it, I'll accept that rule!!`
` Even an elementary school kid can get into an endless argument and find fault with everything."`
`"Then let's restart right now, and continue where we left off.`
` I'll repeat it again.`
` "Dad and the rest entered the chapel using a hidden door, or were carried in through one"!"`
`"Then I shall repeat what I said.`
` "{p:1:Regardless of whether they were alive or dead,`
` the six definitely entered through the door}"!"`
`".........I‐is there any proof?!"`
`"<Stop>!!`
` I will supplement the rule."`
`"......When I speak the truth, I will use red,`
` and {i:when I do, I do not bear the responsibility of establishing that by showing proof}!`
` It is simply a fact and the truth!!"`
`"The reason is simple.`
` I carry out all of the crimes with magic.`
` So for any impossible crime, all I have to do is wave my magic staff before your eyes."`
`"But that wouldn't make a game!`
` It would be like the barbarism of ignoring victory and defeat in a chess game and punching your opponent!"`
`"W‐......well, that is true.`
` ...If you were a witch,`
` {i:there'd be no need for you to show proof}.`
` ......Because you could do anything with magic... That's nasty...`
` What an unfair game...!"`
`"So shall we resume once more?`
` The six people definitely entered through the door.`
` I unlocked it with magic.`
` ......How will you defeat this magic, this locked room?!"`
`"......The, the key!`
` Genji‐san and the others said there was only one key, but that's impossible to prove!`
` The culprit secretly made a duplicate key...!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` {p:1:Only one key to the chapel exists}!"`
`"Arg......`
` Th‐then what about this.`
` The culprit used something other than a legitimate key to open it!`
` I don't know what, but maybe a wire!`
` A tool for picking locks!!"`
`"What is this naive move?`
` {p:1:It is impossible to unlock the lock to the chapel with anything but the chapel's key}!!`
` Although it can be opened with the power of magic, of course...?"`
`"Then what about this!!`
` There's something wrong with the door itself!`
` Even while it was locked, there was some way to pass through it...!`
` As to what that is, I can think of a few ways!"`
`"Maybe like on the big doors to a castle which have a smaller door on them, there was another door here!`
` It's also possible that they removed the hinges, and then removed the whole door before entering!!"`
`"Wahahahahahahahahahaha!`
` Is this the intelligence of a hundred years of humanity, Battleeeeeeer?!`
` {p:1:When the door to the chapel is locked, it prevents any and all methods of entry or exit}!!"`
`"As long as you can't use magic, of course...?`
` *cackle*!`
` Is it about time for checkmate?!"`
`"Not even close!!`
` You said that the six people entered through "the door", but you didn't say it was this front door!`
` They might have entered through another secret door!!"`
`"You talk too much, you incompetent fool.`
` Then let me advance more on my earlier move.`
` {p:1:The six definitely entered through {i:this front door}}!!"`
`"That's screwed up!!`
` The door was locked, it was impossible to unlock without using that single key, and yet six people entered through this door?!?!`
` How did they do it?!!`
` Magic, you say?!`
` Damn it, damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it!!!"`
`"Wahahahahahahaaah!!`
` Have we already exposed a human's limits?"`
`"Then shout <resign>!!`
` It is customary for the surrendering player to shout that and topple their king.`
` Come on, do you give up?!`
` Then proclaim your submission, and kneel, as if toppling your king!!"`
`"And then you shall kiss my shoes!`
` There's no greater joy than forcing a man like you to lick my shoes, *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*kakaka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}kakaka!!"`
`.........Damn iiiiiiiiit...`
` It's no good, no good, no good...`
`{n}So I can't win against the witch...?!`
`This isn't chess at all—I've just been made to take the losing side in a chess problem...!`
` Is quibbling about details and getting a draw the best I can do...?`
`"That definitely will not happen...!`
` Either I will surrender, or you will surrender!!`
` There will be no resolution other than those!!`
` What happened to that bravery when you said this would be torture for us both?!"`
`"Wait wait wait wait, what a let down, this is quite disappointiiiiiiing!`
` Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeer...????"`
`Damn iiiiiiiiiiiit, what should I do, what?!!`
` I can see it, I can see myself facing checkmate...!!`
`Aaaaaaaaah, it's no good, it's no good, all of my hard‐fought moves are nothing more than desperately moving my king, running away from check.`
` ......No matter how many times I move, I can't escape from being checked.`
` So even without waiting for the next several moves, I can see mate in my future!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit.........!!`
`.........After a few more moves, ......I see myself being......checkmated......?`
`.................................`
`......Don't give up, Ushiromiya Battler.`
`{n}If I can see myself getting closed in upon...`
`......Then if I flip over the chessboard......I can anticipate the next move, right...?`
`Kyrie‐san told me...`
` When considering something, the closer you get to the very, very end, ......the easier it becomes to anticipate.`
`Flip it over.`
`{n}......Flip over...the chessboard...!!`
`"......................................................"`
`"......What's wrong?`
` You've gone silent all of a sudden.`
` Don't worry.`
` Surrender is but a momentary shame.`
` After that, there is only the pleasure of letting it all go..."`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` Come, cry out your resignation.`
` .........I can't hear you...`
` Speak clearly in a loud voice."`
`".............You oughta wake up, then.`
` You just aren't listening.`
` ...So I'll say it once more.`
` ......I won't resign.`
` ......We're continuing.`
` I'm resuming the game."`
`"...............Hoh.`
` Very well.`
` It is your turn.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*."`
`"I was making the mistake of thinking that this rule you made was your own weapon.`
` ......However, I've realized that it can also become a weapon for me.`
` ............It all comes down to this."`
`"Try it."`
`"I've spent the whole time focused on how they entered the locked room of the chapel...`
` .........That way of thinking was no good."`
`"......Yeah, it's no good, it's no goddamn good at all.`
` ......Flip over the chessboard."`
`".........That's right.`
` The direction of my thinking was backwards.`
` ......This is how I should think.`
` ............How was the chapel, which wasn't a locked room in the first place, made to look like a locked room?"`
`"Here it is.`
` ......The thinking technique that humans gave birth to a century ago.`
` Give it a try, *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"...Say this in red for me.`
` If it's impossible, then decline.`
` ...Here I go."`
`......This man, ......he thinks he has turned away from his defensive posture?`
`{n}Impudent...`
`"I understand that the only way to enter the chapel is through the door, and that there was only one key.`
` .........But hold it right there.`
` ...Was that key really handed over to Maria yesterday before noon?"`
`".........Long‐winded.`
` Summarize it."`
`"It's something like this.`
` ...We've been under the impression that since midday yesterday, the key was unusable.`
` Therefore, we've been under the impression that this was a locked room from midday yesterday until this morning!"`
`"I want you to clearly state that this isn't just an impression, but a fact."`
`"Interesting.`
` ......So you reason not about the door, but the key."`
`"Yesterday, Maria received an envelope from you.`
` Maria didn't open it, but she might have felt it and learned there was a key inside.`
` ......But it's not as if she could have checked it was definitely the key to the chapel."`
`".........So this is what I'm getting at.`
` ......The envelope that was handed to Maria contained a fake."`
`"...I waited all that time for that nonsense?`
` {p:1:This morning, Rosa definitely took an envelope out of Maria's handbag,}`
` {p:1:and from that obtained the genuine key to the chapel}.`
` ...It wasn't a fake, as you say."`
`"Heheh...`
` I know that much.`
` I'll continue."`
`"......So, when Maria received the envelope, inside it, was there definitely that same key to the chapel?"`
`".................................`
` .........Hoh."`
`"What I mean is basically this.`
` ......Midday yesterday, you gave Maria an envelope with a key inside.`
` And you told her that she mustn't open it.`
` .........Maria probably realized that there was a key inside."`
`"And because later on, Auntie Rosa used what was inside the envelope to open the door to the chapel,`
` {i:we thought that was the key to the chapel}.`
` This is the suspicious part!"`
`"........................So is this what you are trying to say?`
` That when I entrusted Maria with a key, that key was a fake?`
` And then, by the time Rosa obtained it, it had been switched with the real thing...?"`
`"Yeah, that's it.`
` ......What's wrong, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama?`
` Looks like you haven't been feeling good for a while...?"`
`"......Those close to me sometimes call me Beato.`
` Beato is fine."`
`"It's your turn, Beato."`
`"<Turn of the golden witch!>`
` ......Show me how you defeat that."`
`"............Very well.`
` ...{p:1:The key to the chapel truly was the object inside the envelope I gave Maria}."`
`"I'll chase you.`
` ......Can you repeat it in red?`
` ......‘That envelope was completely under Maria's supervision until Auntie Rosa opened it’."`
`".........................................."`
`"...If it's impossible, then state that you decline.`
` Check."`
`"............kh, ...............I decline."`
`"Now the one‐turn advantage has flipped over.`
` ...Now it's time for your king to run, Beato."`
`"......Ehh, I have a reason for declining.`
` That is regarding the definition of the phrase "under her supervision".`
` ...In its purest meaning, Maria would need to have her eyes on it around the clock."`
`"...But Maria didn't go that far.`
` It was probably completely under her supervision during the time she had it outside of her handbag, but after she put it into her handbag, it disappeared from her field of vision.`
` ......It's just that the phrase "under her supervision" is inappropriate in that sense, so I couldn't use red.`
` ...........................kh..."`
`"......That was probably a painful move.`
` Your face tells me that you've guessed the next one."`
`"...............Sorry.`
` I'm gentle with women.`
` I don't hurt women.`
` {i:I don't betray a woman's expectations}!"`
`".........Repeat it for me in red—say it if you can.`
` "No one was able to touch Maria's handbag until Auntie Rosa took out the envelope"."`
`"........................I will also......decline this.`
` ...I won't explain the reason."`
`"That's wrong.`
` ......It's not that you won't explain.`
` You can't explain.`
` .........With that move, it's checkmate, isn't it...?"`
`".................................kh..."`
`"If you can't do it, then I'll explain for you.`
` .........The key to the chapel really was in the envelope that you handed to Maria.`
` ...Then Maria put it in her handbag, and the next morning, Auntie Rosa took it out and opened the lock."`
`"............However!`
` Maria didn't have the handbag under her complete supervision!`
` There's no need for magic.`
` It's a locked room trick that's possible for a human!"`
`"The {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} culprit handed Maria the key,`
` and by making Auntie Rosa use it the next morning, they created the illusion that there was a locked room during that time."`
`"You can't deny the possibility that during that time, the culprit took the key from Maria's handbag, used it,`
` and returned it to the handbag by morning!!"`
`"Can you say it in red?!"`
`"Repetition requested—say it if you can!!`
` It's check again!!!"`
`"H‐......hold on.`
` I'll remove the check...`
` ...The envelope with the key in it should have been sealed with wax...!`
` Rosa took it from an unopened envelope—"`
`"Really! Let's hear it, then!!"`
`"Repetition requested!!`
` "The envelope handed over midday yesterday and the envelope that Auntie Rosa opened are the same thing"."`
`"Th‐that I can repeat.`
` {p:1:The envelope I handed over to Maria and the one Rosa opened are the same thing}!!"`
`"......Haah...!`
` ...Aaaaah, that's no good, that's no goddamn good at all.`
` Who even cares about that anymore?"`
`"...I had expectations for you.`
` ......If you had resigned here, I would have thought of you as someone pretty good at reading between the lines.`
` ......So I'm disappointed.`
` ............{i:You've betrayed my expectations}."`
`"Wh‐............wha......aat.........!!"`
`"It isn't important whether the envelopes are the same thing.`
` ......Because envelopes can be sealed with wax over and over!`
` The key inside should be the important thing."`
`"...kh.....................kuuuuuuu........."`
`"This time, it's all over, Golden Witch.`
` It's a real checkmate.`
` ......I'll ask one more time, repetition requested!!`
` Say it if you can!"`
`"‘The key to the chapel inside the envelope Maria received wasn't used even once until Auntie Rosa opened the envelope’!!"`
`"..................h...`
`............kh...`
`...............how...`
`............!`
` How.........`
`c‐`
`......could I.........`
`to a lowly human.........!!"`
`"I'll keep on saying it, {f:5:Beatrice}!!!"`
`"Repetition requested!!`
` "The key to the chapel inside the envelope Maria received wasn't used even once until Auntie Rosa opened the envelope"!!"`
`"......u...ku......ooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhh!!!"`
`"If you're gonna yell, then make it words—<resign>, right?!`
` It's settled!!`
` This is the truth."`
`"Before Auntie Rosa obtained Maria's key this morning, at one point, it passed into someone else's hands."`
`"Then they used it, resealed it, and returned it to Maria's handbag, making it look like it hadn't been used!"`
`"This is a trick with a cheap loophole: the assumption that the key wasn't used because the sealing wax wasn't broken!!"`
`"Checkmate!!`
` There's no magic, it's nothing more than a trick that's possible for humans!!"`
`"In, in that case... Who do you say stole the key?!`
` Try answering!`
` This time, you try repeating it...!!"`
`"That's right, I'm making you repeat things all the time.`
` I probably have to answer myself every once in a while......"`
`"{i:But I refuse}!!`
` My condition for victory is denying the existence of witches.`
` Once I've proven that your impossible crimes by magic are possible by human hands, I'm done!!"`
`"I've smashed your locked room with something possible even for humans.`
` However, I won't specifically investigate who the culprit is."`
`"And that is because I believe in humans!!`
` Because I definitely won't accept that there's a person among us who would steal the key from Maria, use it, and do something so horrible!!"`
`"Heh, hehehehehhahahahahahahaha!!!`
` I give up, I resign!`
` With regard to this one board in particular, I'll give up for now.`
` ...But, you really are naive, Battler."`
`"Parting remarks are the loser's privilege.`
` Enjoy them as much as you want."`
`"......kh...!`
` As long as you continue to deny my existence, you will eventually be cornered..."`
`"After all, as long as you deny me, you will have to suspect those relatives that you have no end of love for...!`
` In the last moment, when you have to suspect one who is beloved to you, then you will definitely accept my existence...!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*, certainly, you have taken this board.`
` ......However, that naive logic will definitely destroy you...`
` ......You can't win against me after all!!`
` Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!!"`
`...Rosa and the rest returned from the chapel to the parlor in the mansion.`
`{n}Such a horrific thing had happened so early in the morning.`
`{n}Of course they were high‐strung...`
`Battler and George—who had cried, raged, and let their emotions explode after seeing their parents' tragic bodies—`
`returned to the parlor, sat on the sofas, and let their minds go blank, as though everything up until then had been a lie...`
`Only Maria was completely unchanged, and looked just like normal.`
`......When she wasn't being mischievous, she was basically a kid who played wordlessly by herself,`
` so even if her mind was blank, she would probably look as she did.`
`...But as she turned on the TV and flipped through the channels, it looked as though nothing about her had changed from normal.`
`Perhaps Rosa had some opinions about this attitude, which was clearly different from normal people.`
`......She stared at Maria's back with a gaze that wasn't quite pleasant.`
`Eventually, Kumasawa came to say good morning.`
` ...Her cheerful manner was clearly out of place, and she couldn't help but be bewildered at the strange atmosphere in the room.`
`......Then, she heard the details from Gohda, and expressed her shock in a truly noisy manner.`
`"O‐o‐o‐of course you've contacted the police, right...?!`
` What should we do in a time like this, oooh, what should we do...?!"`
`".........Please listen calmly.`
` ...It seems that some kind of apparatus was done in by lightning last night.`
` Because of that, we have become unable to use the telephones..."`
`"Huuuh?!!`
` Th‐then, until the typhoon passes, we can't even contact the police?!"`
`Maybe Kumasawa's exaggerated surprise was a little comical.`
`Rosa giggled, in spite of the situation.`
`......Because of that, the fog of confusion that had covered her head cleared up a little.`
`".........I've got to stay strong.`
` ......It's not just Maria.`
` ......I'm acting as a parent for George‐kun and Battler‐kun too now, so I have to stay strong......"`
`Rosa had been the youngest sibling, with a large difference in age between her and the others.`
`{n}So she was always treated as a child.`
`Every time she learned something new, it was something obvious to her brothers and sister,`
` and she had grown a complex, thinking that she must be incompetent.`
`So she had formed a passive attitude, asking her brothers and sister for advice every time something happened...`
`.........But she no longer had any brothers or sisters.`
`{n}Now, Rosa was the only one of the four Ushiromiya siblings left.`
`...Furthermore, if Kinzo continued to shut himself away even in this extraordinary situation,`
` ......Rosa would have to surpass this crisis as the representative of the head.`
`"...............I'm not a child anymore, not a child.`
` ................................."`
`...Rosa slapped her knees lightly and stood up.`
`She must not wait for orders now.`
`{n}...She had to start moving herself.`
`She picked up the receiver to the extension phone on the side table.`
`{n}......Then she immediately remembered that the telephones were out of order.`
`Genji and Shannon, who she had sent to see Kinzo, hadn't returned yet.`
`...She had a general guess.`
` He was probably yelling about something nonsensical again, and they were unable to calm him.`
`...His important chapel had been defiled with blood.`
`{n}That was easy to imagine.`
`She had planned on using the extension phone to call the study, but with the telephone line dead, there was nothing else for it.`
`Rosa decided to go to the study directly, with her own two feet.`
`Her old self would have been so frightened that she wouldn't have been able to go see Kinzo.`
`...And in fact, if she did meet him, she would probably be blamed for something and abused.`
`But now wasn't the time to be frightened.`
` .........As his true daughter, she had to make him aware of the current situation.`
`"......Kumasawa‐san,`
` I'm going to see Father.`
` ...Take special care of George‐kun and Battler‐kun.`
` ......I'm sure they are on edge right now."`
`"Yes, yes...`
` I am quite sure they must be...`
` ...It is truly pitiable...`
` I shall make them something warm to drink."`
`"Thank you."`
`Rosa went out into the hallway, and headed towards Kinzo's study.`
`The atmosphere in this mansion, which she had spent her younger days in and should have been full of memories, seemed somehow different...`
`And she began to climb the stairs in the entrance hall...`
`......Just then.`
` In the gloom down the stairs behind Rosa, ...something glowed.`
`It was a single fluttering gold butterfly.`
`{n}...It fluttered around and sparkled.`
`{n}That butterfly quietly danced without a sound.`
`......Obviously.`
` No one can hear the sound of a butterfly's wings beating.`
`.........And then, ......it stopped on Rosa's back as she slowly climbed the stairs.`
`Rosa didn't notice.`
` And to an ignorant observer, it would probably have looked just as though a single sheet of gold leaf in the shape of a butterfly had gotten stuck there.`
`Without noticing, Rosa continued heading to Kinzo's study......`
`".........Wellll then, in what way should I entertain myself next?`
` ...There are still many, many pieces left.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`In the parlor, which had returned to silence, the only sound was that of the TV, which Maria was watching alone.`
`If there was anything audible other than that, it was the sound of the rain which had continued on and on since last night.`
`Every one of those people who had viewed that unearthly and horrible scene stayed silent, as though praying that the events of this morning were all a dream.`
`Only Kumasawa hadn't seen it, and so acted slightly differently.`
`...She instead found this silence difficult to bear, and was fidgety with the desire to cheer everyone up.`
`...However, unable to say more than she should, it seemed that she was racking her brains as to how she could be of some use...`
`Normally it would be time for breakfast.`
` ......However, maybe because something like that had happened, Gohda seemed to have forgotten about preparing a meal.`
`...No, maybe everyone was so beaten up that they had forgotten their hunger.`
`Kumasawa wanted to bring up the subject of what they would do for breakfast, but it didn't seem like the right atmosphere, so she really couldn't.`
`But it was difficult being hungry.`
`{n}...So, she casually made a proposal.`
`"...I imagine you all must be tired after all that has happened.`
` ......In times like this, I think the best thing is to heat yourself with some warm black tea."`
`"......Mm, that is a good plan.`
` I agree as well."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` How about some delicious black tea with biscuits and jam?`
` Oh yes, yes, it seems that it's near Halloween—there were some delicious‐looking pumpkin‐shaped cookies on the shelf..."`
`"......Ah, Kumasawa‐san, that's........."`
`Of course, she had said the wrong thing.`
` ...Because she had reminded Battler and the rest about that horrible and tragic Halloween party in the chapel...`
`Nanjo hurriedly whispered into Kumasawa's ear.`
`".........................................."`
`"......Battler‐san, I am truly sorry!`
` ...I didn't mean anything bad, gracious, no..."`
`"No, don't worry about it.`
` .........I'll definitely turn this boiling anger back on the culprit."`
`".........I wonder if that culprit is still on the island."`
`"Probably.`
` After all, there's not gonna be a boat coming until the typhoon passes."`
`"Ye‐...yes, my goodness!`
` Because the boats don't come even if there is a little wind.`
` They certainly wouldn't be able to ride one during a typhoon, good gracious no!"`
`"......It creeps me out."`
`"You think so too, Aniki?`
` Me too.`
` .........Regardless of whether the culprit was that mystery guest or not."`
`"That's right.`
` ......We are naturally suspecting the mysterious guest who calls herself {f:5:Beatrice},`
` but we still cannot be sure that she is the culprit.`
` ...There is still the possibility she's a {i:victim whose corpse still hasn't been found}."`
`"......When I think of it that way, there's something I just can't understand."`
`"What do you......mean by that......?"`
`"It's simple.`
` It's just like Kumasawa baa‐chan said a short while ago.`
` Right now, this island is right in the midst of the typhoon, and escape is impossible.`
` The same thing goes for the culprit.`
` .........In that case, having the crime come to light should have been the thing that the culprit most wanted to avoid."`
`"......That's right.`
` ...There was no need to draw that creepy magic circle on the entrance to the chapel, and show off the fact that the corpses were there."`
`"Right, exactly that.`
` Furthermore, if they were able to take the time and effort to do something so horrible to those six,`
` ......it should have been equally possible for them to hide the six corpses where they would be impossible to find."`
`"I agree. That brutal Halloween party probably wasn't directed at those who died.`
` ......It was directed at the people who would eventually discover it: us.`
` You could probably claim that the magic circle was there to show it to us."`
`"...The culprit knew that they wouldn't be able to get away from this island for a while.`
` ......And yet, they acted as though they wanted to make us find the corpses in the middle of this typhoon."`
`"......What...does this mean?`
` ...If I was the culprit, I definitely wouldn't play around and make us find the corpses."`
`"............{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama was not in her room.`
` ...The room did not seem particularly disturbed.`
` ......Ah, no, Milady did disturb it quite a lot though..."`
`"...Come to think of it, what happened to Jessica?"`
`"Kanon‐san is looking after her.`
` ...They are probably in Milady's room."`
`"............That isn't good.`
` ...The culprit is definitely still on the island.`
` ......In this situation, I don't believe it's a very good idea to isolate ourselves in small numbers."`
`"Wh‐what do you mean by that...?`
` Y‐y‐you don't mean to say that the culprit plans to kill all of us...?!`
` Awawa{0}wa{0}wa{0}wa{0}wawawa..."`
`"Let us remain calm...`
` That is not yet certain..."`
`"But we can't deny the possibility, much to my chagrin. Ihihi."`
`"......This letter was in the chapel.`
` According to this, the culprit is the witch,`
` and if we don't solve the riddle of Grandfather's epitaph and find the gold, she'll massacre the whole family...or something like that."`
`"Is that true...!`
` Umm, would you allow me to read it as well...?"`
`"Hii...{0}hi...{0}hi...{0}hieee{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}eeee...{0}eeee{0}e{0}e{0}eeee...{0}hh..."`
`"......mmmmmmmgh......"`
`As they read the witch's letter, Gohda, Kumasawa, and Nanjo's faces grew even paler than they had been...`
`Kumasawa could no longer hide her shaking.`
`".........If you don't want to die, try finding Grandfather's hidden gold, huh.`
` ...Screwing around with us.`
` I'll bet you can't solve the riddle, so you're trying to make us solve it...!"`
`"However, ...I wonder what the truth is.`
` Madam always insisted that the Legend of the Gold was nothing more than a fantasy created by the Master.`
` ......It is doubtful whether that actually existed..."`
`"True...`
` Supposedly, they thought it would be nice if it existed, but only somewhat believed it.`
` ......The relatives only all started believing in the Legend of the Gold after Kinzo's health worsened and the inheritance problem came up.`
` I would think that there were very few people who believed it before then."`
`"...Really? I wonder if that's why.`
` Do you remember?`
` On the table in the chapel.`
` ...There were three gold ingots.`
` That alone is worth quite a lot.`
` Couldn't that truly prove that the Legend of the Gold was real?"`
`"E‐...excuse me, ...please wait.`
` Just now, did you say three gold bars......?"`
`"......Yeah, there were definitely three of them piled up.`
` So what?"`
`"Well, umm, I, .........happened to hear Krauss‐sama talking about it once.`
` ......Yes, I just heard it, you understand?!`
` It's not like I was trying to listen to his discussions in secret, gracious no!"`
`"Don't worry about that now.`
` So then what?`
` Is there something wrong with there being three of those gold bars?"`
`"...Y‐yes.`
` According to Krauss‐sama, ...there was only one bar ever found to support the Legend of the Gold."`
`"......That is correct.`
` I do believe the story goes that Kinzo‐san showed the president of Marusoo a mountain of gold, and let him take one bar back with him."`
`"And that one came to be in Krauss‐sama's possession.`
` And he said this as well.`
` That there was no gold which supported the Master's legend besides that one..."`
`"You're talking about my uncle here, right?`
` So what have we got here?`
` ......No wait, ......three?!`
` Wait, wait, where did they come from, that's too many of them!"`
`"Might we not think of it this way?`
` Maybe the other people in the family each found one, and they each brought one of them there..."`
`"No, I cannot believe that.`
` When all of the relatives came to the mansion, I was entrusted with their luggage.`
` I did not feel any suspicious weight back then."`
`"......I think they weighed about ten kilograms.`
` If that much weight was in their bags, even I would notice.`
` But it didn't seem that way."`
`"Same here.`
` At the most, there were some changes of clothes, medicine, Kyrie‐san's makeup.`
` That's about it, I think.`
` Auntie Rosa's luggage also looked pretty light."`
`"......In that case, those three piled up gold bars were being shown to them, ...or maybe us.`
` ......Telling us that the Legend of the Gold is definitely real.`
` That it isn't a fantasy.`
` And challenging us to uncover it."`
`"Could there be a scheme...to have us solve the epitaph which points to the hidden location, and then try to snatch it away?"`
`"............That does fit best.`
` ...But there are a few parts that don't make sense.`
` First, our parents, who should have been the most likely to be able to solve the epitaph, were killed first.`
` I think that creates an immediate contradiction."`
`".........And something else makes even less sense.`
` ......They're trying to say that the Legend of the Gold is actually true,`
` {i:but how could they prepare that gold}?`
` ......It's almost like the culprit has already found the gold,`
` and is telling us to try and find it too."`
`"Maybe the culprit obtained those three like Uncle Krauss and thereby became certain about the Legend of the Gold,`
` and is trying to make us search for the rest... I think that way is the most convincing."`
`"...........................`
` ......The pieces on the chessboard aren't lining up at all.`
` ............We don't have a clue what the culprit is planning, what they want, what they want to make us do.`
` ............Is it pointless?`
` Thinking about anything, at this point in time.`
` ..........................."`
`"......Kihihi.`
` It was written down.`
` What she wants you to do.`
` Can't any of you read? Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi."`
`Maria suddenly laughed in a creepy voice.`
`...I'd thought she'd been concentrating on the TV, but she'd been listening in too, apparently.`
`As she remained facing the TV, ...she very simply told us what we were forgetting.`
`"{f:5:Beatrice} hasn't said one word about wanting the gold.`
` ......She's not asked anything except whether you can solve the epitaph's riddle or not."`
`"...Although I bet she thinks it'll be impossible for you anyway.`
` ......Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi."`
`"......So you're saying you can solve it, Maria?"`
`"...Don't caaare.`
` She's going to take me to the Golden Land, so.`
` Won't get in {f:5:Beatrice}'s way.`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi,`
` ouch."`
`"Looks like if we wanna understand further, we're gonna have to ask Maria.`
` ...Maria, tell us.`
` ...............Who is this {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` What is she planning?"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!`
` Well, you see, {f:5:Beatrice} is a witch!`
` She can do anything with her wondrous powers."`
`"Anything can be done with the power of magic.`
` You can create gold, you can create bread.`
` And of course, you can even create sweets!`
` You saw it, didn't you?`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!"`
`"......hn?"`
`At that time, everyone jumped at the sound of a door being closed forcefully.`
`We turned around to find that at some point Rosa had returned, bringing Genji and Shannon.`
`......Then she rapidly approached Maria, her heels clacking, and hit her sharply on the cheek.`
`"......Stop talking about that.`
` Battler‐kun and the rest will take it badly."`
`"..................Uu..."`
`Without waiting for a response, she slapped Maria's cheek once more.`
`{n}Everyone could only stand there, shocked.`
`"I don't know what "uu" means.`
` What about yes?"`
`"...............Uu."`
`She mercilessly slapped Maria's cheek again.`
`......Maybe she didn't feel like resisting after being hit twice.`
`Maria weakly said yes.`
`"Ro‐......Rosa‐san, there was no reason to do something so harsh..."`
`"...This is my daughter's education.`
` I would greatly appreciate it if you didn't interject."`
`The atmosphere around Rosa, with Genji and Shannon in tow, was somehow cold, and yet dignified,`
` ...completely different from how she seemed before she left.`
`We saw that Auntie Rosa was holding something that looked like a gun.`
`{n}......I couldn't imagine that she would have brought back a toy in this situation.`
`"Auntie Rosa, what is...?"`
`"......This is Father's.`
` Because of the current situation, I borrowed it specially.`
` .........I'm sure you all realize as well as I do.`
` The culprit is still nearby.`
` We don't know what could happen."`
`"...............I agree.`
` ......Rather than trying to figure out what the culprit is planning, it might be better to first think about our own safety."`
`"..........................."`
`"Father was alright, but he was slightly agitated by these sudden events.`
` ...Fortunately, he said that he won't leave his room, so he's probably safe.`
` Now, we should do all we can to gather in the same place."`
`"...I agree.`
` We don't even know where the culprit is hiding, ......and anyway, there's no proof that there's only one of them.`
` ..............."`
`I shivered at the words that had come out of my own mouth.`
`That's right.`
` Could a single person kill six people and create such a horrible scene all alone?`
`......Isn't it natural to assume that this crime was carried out by multiple culprits?`
`"......I agree with Rosa‐san.`
` It is probably good for us to gather in one place."`
`"My goodness, yes, I also think that is good, yes, yes!"`
`".........Maybe it would be good to call Milady and Kanon‐san here already."`
`"Good idea.`
` ......Let's have them come down."`
`George‐aniki made to grab the extension phone, but Gohda‐san shook his head.`
`......Oh, right, we can't use the phones right now.`
`"......I'll go with a couple people.`
` If George‐aniki and Gohda‐san come as well, that should be enough."`
`"............No.`
` Let's all go together.`
` ...It's a "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle".`
` {i:If we're all gathered together here in equilibrium}, that situation is the most safe."`
`"...‘Wolves and Sheep Puzzle’?"`
`"......Uu.`
` I have it.`
` Show you."`
`"Maria, turn off the television.`
` ......Genji‐san.`
` Please tell me where Jessica‐chan's room is.`
` Let's all go together."`
`"......Yes.`
` I will guide you."`
`"Come on, everyone.`
` We'll move together.`
` Follow my instructions."`
`We stood up.`
` Maria alone looked like she had some lingering attachment to the TV, but she went along with everyone for now, and got up.`
`"...Shannon, thank goodness.`
` I was a little worried when you took so long to get back."`
`"I am sorry to have worried you.`
` The Master ordered me to copy down something..."`
`"Copy down?"`
`"............Shannon."`
`"I, .........I am sorry, excuse me..."`
`We headed for Jessica's room, led by Genji‐san, and Auntie Rosa, holding the gun.`
`Jessica and Kanon‐kun are a girl and boy of about the same age.`
` That'd sure be a shame if we walked in on them at a bad tiiime, is what I'd have joked about normally, I'm sure.`
`However, Auntie Rosa was on edge, constantly exuding tension.`
` ...So it really wasn't the kind of atmosphere where I could joke like that.`
`"Hey, don't fall behind!!`
` Everyone move together!`
` We don't know when or where the culprit might leap out at us, you know?!"`
`...No, maybe Auntie Rosa's attitude was more appropriate.`
`{n}......Since Grandfather hadn't come down, Auntie Rosa was the leader.`
`This wasn't a situation where she could smile like she always did.`
`......And Auntie Rosa was herself a mother.`
` She probably also thought that, if she didn't get ahold of herself, some harm might befall her beloved daughter.`
`The culprit had killed six of our parents at once.`
`{n}......The method they had used was unknown, but there was a good chance that this opponent could take down a large number of people in an instant.`
`Was that with weapons, or with numbers?`
`{n}......Or was it the magic of a witch?`
`In any case, it definitely didn't look like there were any factors indicating we could get careless...`
`The rest of us should also take much, much greater care, like Auntie Rosa...`
`"............Everyone, stop!"`
`Auntie Rosa spoke in a sharp voice.`
`When we peered forwards, wondering what was up...`
`{n}......we immediately noticed the reason...`
`".........Wh‐......what is this......"`
`"Hii...............!"`
`"Everyone, get back...!"`
`Gohda‐san and Genji‐san approached the door...`
`{n}Jessica's room was probably on the other side of that door.`
`"This......seems to be the same paint that was scribbled on the door to the chapel."`
`"......It appears so.`
` It appears that not much time has passed since it was drawn."`
`"What is that......`
` ......Another...magic circle?!"`
`"......It's the first magic circle of the moon.`
` ...It has the power to open unopenable doors."`
`The door to Jessica's room......had that creepy graffiti on it which had been drawn on the door to the chapel.`
`......That strange shape definitely had some meaning related to the occult.`
`But it didn't matter what that meaning was.`
`{n}We were more worried about whether those two were alright.`
`"Tha‐that doesn't matter!`
` Are Jessica‐chan and Kanon‐kun alright?!"`
`"...I have a bad premonition...`
` We should quickly take those two downstairs."`
`"Milady!`
` Milady!!`
` Are you there?`
` Please answer!!"`
`Gohda‐san knocked violently and yelled, ...but there was no answer.`
`He twisted the doorknob with a clatter, but the lock just resisted him.`
`"......Rosa‐sama, it seems to be locked."`
`"There are no other options.`
` Please open it."`
`Genji nodded, and Gohda quickly unlocked the door with the master key.`
`...In the back of my mind, horrible images floated up and disappeared, one after another.`
`{n}......A magic circle had been drawn on the door to the chapel.`
`{n}And six corpses had been behind that.`
`......So, if there was a magic circle drawn on the door to Jessica's room, ......then beyond it............`
`"Je‐............Jessica‐sama!!"`
`"Wh‐what happened?`
` Is she there?!"`
`"Jessica!!`
` What happened?!!"`
`......It was truly heartless.`
`...The expression on Gohda‐san's face and what he said when he opened the door...`
`prepared us for the brutal fate that Jessica might have met, even without seeing her...`
`Everyone tumbled into Jessica's room at once.`
`{n}...That scene told everyone that their worst fears were right on the mark...`
`"...Jessicaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`".........Oh......my......`
` ...Doc‐...Doctor Nanjo!!"`
`The room seemed elegant for Jessica's age, and there she was inside it, lying on the ground.`
`There was a large pool of blood on the floor.`
`......And there was a knife or something sticking deep into her back......`
`...Was it a knife?`
` There was a design in the handle that had to have been done in a devil motif.`
`There was no doubt that this weapon(?) carried some kind of occult meaning.`
`"...This is.........horrible.`
` ...She has passed away.`
` ......This...probably...reaches her lungs...`
` ......Not much time has passed since she died."`
`"Jessicaaaaaaaaaaaa!!`
` Damn it, damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`"......B‐Battler‐sama......"`
`"I was naive!!`
` I knew it!!`
` Since they couldn't escape the island, the culprit was definitely close by!`
` Then why wasn't I on my guard straight away!!`
` ......I was naive!!`
` I just assumed that culprits sneak away after they commit a crime!"`
`"......We were stunned then.`
` We thought we just had to accept it when Jessica‐chan gave in to rage and ran off.`
` ......But we were naive.`
` We should have stopped her...!"`
`"...Gohda‐san, why did you leave those two alone?!`
` If only you had been with them, something like this would never...!!"`
`"N‐no, you, you see, I...!!`
` I said it was dangerous so we should return!`
` It's just that...Milady said that she wanted to be alone!`
` Kanon‐san told me to leave it to him, and...!"`
`"......Speaking of which, where is Kanon‐san...?!"`
`"That's right!`
` What in the world happened to Kanon‐kun?!"`
`"K‐......Kanon‐kun...`
` Where........."`
`"Kanon‐san should have been with Milady...`
` Where in the world...!"`
`"You don't think...they got him...?!"`
`".......................................`
` Quiet.`
` .........Someone might be hiding in this room.`
` Search under the bed and in the closet!"`
`There was also a chance that Kanon‐kun's corpse had been pushed away somewhere.`
`At Rosa‐san's order, everyone searched the room together.`
`......But there wasn't a single human hiding anywhere.`
`"......He's nowhere!!`
` Could the culprit have taken him out of the room?!`
` Then we have to search for him quickly and save him!`
` ......If we're slow, something awful might happen!!"`
`"Auntie Rosa, let's search all over the mansion!`
` Let's search for the culprit!`
` Let's save Kanon‐kun!!"`
`"........................`
` ............Quiet!!!"`
`Auntie Rosa yelled at us loudly, and we fell instantly silent.`
`She was probably contemplating something.`
`{n}...But what in the world could that be......?`
`...Auntie Rosa walked around the room as though looking for something, ...or as though she was collecting her thoughts.`
`............Then, she found something on the side table by the bed, and picked it up.`
`"...............If anyone knows, tell me.`
` ......What key is this?"`
`Auntie Rosa showed everyone a key with a cute mascot attached to it.`
`...Judging from its cute appearance, I didn't doubt that it was Jessica's key, but I had no way of knowing what key it was.`
`"......It is probably the key to this—to Milady's room."`
`After hearing that, Auntie Rosa made a point of going outside the door and checking.`
`.........Without a doubt, it was the key to this room.`
`"............I wonder why it was set in a place like this.`
` Normally, don't you keep important keys in your pocket?"`
`"...Umm, ............Milady wasn't in the habit of locking her room.`
` Except for when she went to school—`
`it seems she would do it then, because she didn't want Krauss‐sama to look inside her room..."`
`".........I see.`
` She wasn't at school, so it's natural that Jessica‐chan would set the key down here.`
` How many keys can open this door?"`
`"Ju‐...just the one Milady had..."`
`"Can't it be opened with your master keys?"`
`"......They can open it."`
`"How many master keys are there?`
` Do all of the servants have one?`
` Are there extras?"`
`"Yes.`
` We all have one.`
` .........As for extras, ...I wonder."`
`"There used to be several, ...but Madam strongly scolded us that this was careless, so I believe they have been dealt with."`
`"......That is correct.`
` There is only one held by each servant.`
` There are no more."`
`"...nn?`
` Wait a second.`
` ...In the last game, I thought we said there were extra master keys?"`
`"Yes.`
` Regarding that.`
` I have noticed that having several master keys whose locations are unknown is quite disadvantageous for me."`
`"......Well, yeah.`
` Since you want to make me believe in magic by using locked rooms, it must be really disadvantageous for you to have master keys unaccounted for."`
`"...In fact, every time a trick related to locks showed up,`
` I was planning to resist by arguing that the culprit possessed a master key that someone had lost in the past, or a duplicate."`
`"Yes, exactly.`
` So I've decided to make a move to defeat that.`
` ......I'll alter the setup."`
`"`
`{p:1:The only master keys are the ones held by the servants, one key each}.`
` *cackle*cackle*."`
`"...Messing with me.`
` ......More importantly.`
` What is this move?`
` ......What's Auntie Rosa saying?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` Who knows?`
` You should try listening in."`
`"...............Thank you.`
` I have the situation sorted out."`
`"......And I've managed to identify the culprit who assaulted Jessica‐chan, or maybe one of their accomplices."`
`"Wha‐what did you say...?!`
` Who is that?!"`
`"...Auntie Rosa, you can't be talking about Kanon‐kun...?"`
`"......Huh, ......huuuh?!`
` Wh‐why Kanon‐kun?!"`
`"This room was locked.`
` And the only keys that can unlock this room are the master keys that each servant is holding, as well as the key Jessica had."`
`"......But Jessica‐chan's key was closed up in here.`
` ...Which means the only keys that could have locked it are the master keys."`
`"............It is as you say."`
`"In that case, someone killed Jessica‐chan, then locked the door!`
` That person was holding a master key.`
` And there are only five people who were holding master keys!"`
`"Oh, oh my!!`
` It wasn't me, not me!`
` Gracious, no, I couldn't do something like that!"`
`"......Kumasawa‐san, you got up late.`
` After we returned from the chapel to the parlor, we did meet you there,`
` but it's impossible to prove where you were and what you were doing until that time."`
`"You watched us from the shadows, chased after Jessica‐chan and Kanon‐kun when they were isolated, and stealthily attacked them."`
`"A‐are you saying that I visited Milady's room,`
` and did something so horrible?!`
` I, I, I did no such thing!`
` Gracious no, no such thing!!"`
`"What about you, Gohda‐san?`
` You said that you left Jessica‐chan in Kanon‐kun's care and returned."`
`"...But I wonder if that's true?`
` ......I wonder if you didn't really kill the two of them, hide Kanon‐kun's corpse,`
` and then come back with an innocent look on your face?!"`
`"Nothing of the sort happened!`
` I swear on my name that I did not do anything like that!!"`
`"......It, it wasn't us, either...!!`
` We were following the Master's orders and—"`
`"Yes.`
` At least you and Genji‐san are alright.`
` That is backed up by what I heard from Father.`
` The two of you were in Father's room the whole time, one copying and one standing witness.`
` Father and I can guarantee that."`
`".........Thank you very much."`
`"In that case, I think the argument becomes who is more suspicious, Gohda‐san or Kumasawa‐san.`
` ......That's how I thought, too, at least in the first moments after entering this room."`
`".........But then, I thought it was strange.`
` Look at the state of Jessica‐chan's body.`
` Don't you all think it's strange?"`
`"......Strange, ...you say...?"`
`"Jessica‐chan was stabbed in the back.`
` .........Come on, it's often generally said, right?`
` That in crimes where the victim is stabbed in the back, there's a high likelihood that the culprit was someone whose face was known to the victim.`
` She definitely wouldn't invite a person that she doesn't trust into her room, and defenselessly expose her back."`
`"Ro‐......Rosa‐sama, you couldn't mean...`
`.........to say that was Kanon‐kun...?"`
`"Yes.`
` We know well what state Jessica‐chan was in right before she was killed."`
`"......Jessica‐chan was very panicked after seeing her parents' tragic bodies.`
` And it's easy to imagine that after she regained her composure, she'd have been in a horrible slump."`
`"......I can really understand it if Jessica‐chan's frame of mind led her to shut herself up alone in her room.`
` And those particulars would also fit with Gohda‐san's story."`
`"......Jessica‐chan said to leave her alone.`
` ...Then Kanon‐kun, who is of a similar age, and may have had some adolescent relationship with her, said to leave it to him.`
` I can really understand why he'd feel that way."`
`".........And I think that is the very reason why Jessica‐chan welcomed Kanon‐kun into her room."`
`"But what if it had been Gohda‐san or Kumasawa‐san?`
` Would she have let them into her room?"`
`"......I, I believe that I have gained Milady's trust.`
` But even so, err..."`
`"Then you are another suspect after all, right, Gohda‐san?`
` I thought that you probably weren't liked by Jessica‐chan, so I believed she wouldn't have let you into her room."`
`"So I thought it was impossible that you were the culprit, but...?"`
`"No, umm...!`
` .........I am afraid to say that I may not have been accepted by Milady.`
` ...K‐Kumasawa‐san, what about you?"`
`"Ho, hohohohohoho!`
` A senior like me is far too separated by age to understand the feelings of a young person like Milady very well...`
` And perhaps Milady did not open her heart up to me.`
` Right, Gohda‐san?!"`
`"Yes, that's right!`
` She probably did not open her heart to us to a great degree!`
` It would be inconceivable that Milady would let us into her room when she was heartbroken!"`
`Gohda‐san and Kumasawa baa‐chan each clasped their hands together, affirming each other with forced smiles on their faces.`
`It was a really unpleasant routine.`
`"Someone who would be permitted to enter Jessica‐chan's room when she was heartbroken.`
` Who would have been given access to her defenseless back.`
` And that person had a master key.`
` That only points to one person.`
` ......It was impossible for anyone except Kanon‐kun."`
`"Ple‐......please, wait...!`
` Kanon‐kun definitely wouldn't do something like...!"`
`"Oh, then, is there someone else?`
` Is Gohda‐san or Kumasawa‐san suspicious after all?`
` Which of the two do you think is more suspicious, Shannon‐chan...? Come on."`
`"I, ......I, ...don't............"`
`"It wasn't me, Shannon‐san!`
` Gracious, no, it was not me!"`
`"Of course, it wasn't me either!`
` It was Kanon‐san who had a close relationship with Milady, and you, Shannon‐san, if anyone!"`
`".........Oh yes, I almost forgot.`
` ......Jessica‐chan might also have let Shannon‐chan into her room."`
`"But you should have been with Father.`
` .........But in reality,`
` ......are you the culprit...............?"`
`"Sha‐......Shannon can't be the culprit!`
` You only just said that she was doing some important work with Grandfather!"`
`"Yes, I know that.`
` Neither Shannon‐chan nor Genji‐san is the culprit.`
` Even Father acknowledges that they were together the whole time.`
` .........Well then, what do you think, everyone...?"`
`Asked that, no one could respond...`
`{n}Because even if someone did argue back, they would then have to offer the name of a different suspicious person.`
`......And no matter whose name that was, that person was here.`
`{n}...No one could do something like that.`
`Auntie Rosa glanced at everyone in turn, fingering the gun like it was a toy...`
`.........She seemed so different from the normal, kind Auntie Rosa.`
`...No, it's probably because I still don't feel how much danger we're in.`
`{n}...Maybe until Auntie Rosa's attitude seemed natural to me, I wasn't fully appreciating the danger...`
`"Looks like no one has an opinion.`
` Then I will say mine."`
`"Of course, I can't deny the possibility that Kanon‐kun is a victim without a corpse.`
` But until we find his corpse, I also definitely can't deny the possibility that Kanon‐kun is a suspect."`
`"......There's a chance that Kanon‐kun may claim to have been attacked by the culprit and confined somewhere...`
` He may appear unexpectedly with that excuse."`
`"But take care.`
` Maybe, probably—no, definitely.`
` .........{i:Kanon‐kun killed Jessica‐chan}."`
`"............No, ..................no way........."`
`"I, ...I can't believe it...`
` For Kanon‐kun to do that...`
`......to Milady,`
` ......that's too much to accept!!"`
`"I feel the same as Shannon.`
` I oppose labeling Kanon‐kun as the culprit."`
`"Then is the culprit Gohda‐san or is it Kumasawa‐san?`
` Tell me who's more suspicious."`
`""I‐i‐i‐it wasn't us!!""`
`"If it wasn't Kanon‐kun, then who could have locked this door?`
` Shannon‐chan.`
` George‐kun.`
` ......Well?`
` Well, well, well...?"`
`Auntie Rosa closed in on Shannon‐chan and George‐aniki, laughing unpleasantly.`
`...Of course, they couldn't say anything back.`
`They wanted to believe in Kanon‐kun.`
` ...But if they did, they would have to suspect the other servants.`
`The simplest culprit was the mystery guest {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}......But she was nothing more than a guest, and didn't have a master key.`
`.........Then if {f:5:Beatrice} was the culprit without a master key...`
`...Do we have to accept the argument that she really is a witch, and locked the door with the power of magic......?`
`"............That's a filthy argument...`
` ......Filthy...... Filthy......"`
`"What's so difficult?`
` Make it my fault.`
` You can just make it the fault of the 19th person, the mystery guest, can you not?`
` If you do, you won't have to watch this ugly battle of humans pressing each other...`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"So then what.`
` The culprit is the 19th person, the guest {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...She's a witch, so she could lock the door without a key using magic."`
`"Are you telling me to accept that?`
` No goddamn way...!`
` ...No way, no goddamn way...!!"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` In the last game, I learned all of your weak points.`
` So, what now, what now...?`
` You said you're never going to accept me, did you not?`
` In that case, .........you can use Kanon as a perfect sacrifice."`
`"Kanon killed Jessica!`
` If you support Rosa's theory, everything is settled here, you know?`
` Kanon is already dead.`
` There should be no need to show concern for the dead.`
` And you won't have to doubt anyone here!`
` *cackle*hahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!"`
`"Damn it!!`
` I won't accept you!!!`
` But......Kanon‐kun being the culprit, ......that's impossible!!"`
`"..........I don't want to suspect anyone.`
` ...However, it is sometimes the case that the suspicious are the guilty.`
` ......In any case, there is probably nothing better than caution..."`
`"Doc‐...Doctor Nanjo...`
` What do you mean by that...?"`
`"...Umm, please do not misunderstand.`
` ...I do not wish to label Kanon‐san as the culprit.`
` ......However, until we understand the situation, there is the possibility that Kanon‐san is the culprit,`
` and I believe keeping that in mind is safer."`
`"Ho, ......hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` Yes, that's right... You cannot be too cautious."`
`It didn't seem as though anyone blamed Nanjo.`
`{n}In reality, no one thought that Kanon was the culprit.`
`...But if they didn't suspect him, they would have to suspect one of the servants here.`
`......We didn't want to do that.`
`{n}We didn't want to suspect.`
`{n}We didn't want to be suspected.`
`"That is the correct way to think.`
` ......We cannot be too vigilant.`
` Is there anyone who objects to that?"`
`"Listen.`
` ...There is a very high likelihood that this murder case is related to the legend of Father's gold.`
` In that case, it's certainly the crime of someone plotting to keep a vast amount of gold worth tens of billions of yen all for themselves."`
`"......With that amount of money, you could play around for the rest of your life in any country.`
` ...It may be possible that they would massacre us for this reason."`
`".............................."`
`"For the simple reason that our guest wasn't holding a master key, for the murder of Jessica‐chan, and this murder alone,`
` we removed our 19th person—{f:5:Beatrice}—from suspicion.`
` But we can't say that she is unrelated to the crime."`
`"......After all, it's a vast amount of gold we're talking about.`
` We can't deny the possibility that there are multiple culprits.`
` ......Right now, one of the people here among us might have been bought by the culprit!!"`
`As Auntie Rosa yelled, she looked all around, her gun still raised.`
`......Don't believe anyone, suspect the person next to you—that's what she was saying.`
`But no one wanted to suspect.`
`{n}...They didn't want to suspect anyone here.`
`That weakness in their hearts demanded an answer from those not here...`
`"There are only two groups of people you can be sure aren't suspects.`
` .........Yourself, and those who are already corpses.`
` .........The same goes for Kanon‐kun."`
`"Until we catch sight of his corpse, he is the most likely suspect in Jessica‐chan's murder!!`
` So take care.`
` Even if he's still alive, even if he smooths things over with some explanation, you absolutely must not trust him!`
` Alright?!"`
`No one gave a answer of their own initiative.`
` ......However, those who met Auntie Rosa's eyes had to nod their heads...`
`Humans are social beings.`
`{n}......In other words, from the time they are born, trusting each other is imprinted in their genes.`
`...It is unpleasant to go against that.`
`They definitely don't want to suspect anyone.`
`...But if they had to suspect someone,`
` ...they thought that choosing one of the people not here right now would be the most acceptable.`
`For just the reason of acceptability, they had passively chosen to sacrifice Kanon.`
`This is ridiculous.........`
`{n}I definitely don't want to believe that Kanon‐kun is the culprit!`
`I'd only just heard it from George‐aniki, but not only were those two close in age,`
` they also had that adolescent relationship Auntie Rosa had mentioned.`
`......It may be a little late now, but yes, they really did have that kind of air about them.`
`After seeing her parents' tragic bodies, Jessica, bearing deep wounds in her heart, would only have trusted Kanon‐kun.`
`...That's a very conceivable story.`
`{n}So I don't like it...!!`
`Kanon‐kun was the only one she trusted.`
`{n}So she wouldn't have let anyone but Kanon‐kun in.`
`So he was the only one who could have killed Jessica. ......I just can't accept that line of argument......!!!`
`"...Understand?!`
` Even if Kanon‐kun appears, don't get careless!`
` As long as we cannot prove Kanon‐kun's innocence, we will suppose that Kanon‐kun is the culprit who killed Jessica‐chan!!"`
`Auntie Rosa made that claim.`
` By using the ever‐so‐slightly vague word "suppose", ...ultimately, she gave everyone that last little push they needed.`
`Everyone nodded weakly,`
` ...............and, under the excuse that they were just temporarily supposing it,`
` .........they {i:concluded} that Kanon was the culprit who had killed Jessica...`
`.........I wonder what the dead Jessica and Kanon would think if they could hear this exchange.`
`Jessica...was crying.`
`{n}......She was crying in the chest of the person who had put his life on the line to fight for her: Kanon.`
`It was frustrating.`
`{n}So frustrating that it felt like her chest would explode...`
`She grieved and resented how far the dignity of the dead had been trampled...`
`"...Those guys, ...why are they treating you like the culprit?!!"`
`"........................Because there's...no corpse."`
`"Why are they treating you like the culprit because there's no corpse?!`
` You risked your life to fight for me...!"`
`"Then, ......that witch erased your corpse for fun......!`
` To call you the culprit because of that, it's horrible, it's too horrible!!"`
`".........It's alright.`
` ......In the end, I couldn't completely protect you, but...`
` .........I was able to be of use to you, Milady..."`
`"So......why doesn't everyone understand that?!`
` Stop it, Auntie Rosa!!`
` Don't call Kanon‐kun the culprit with that messed up reasoning!!"`
`".........She isn't saying that I'm the culprit.`
` ...She's just saying I'm suspicious,`
` ......no,`
` ......she's saying to be careful."`
`"She is saying it!!`
` These people are saying you're the culprit, Kanon‐kun, so they can stop thinking!`
` They aren't gonna think about who the culprit who killed me is anymore!!`
` They aren't gonna think of the possibility that you aren't the culprit!!"`
`"And after this, every time something happens, they'll repeat the excuse that it was the work of Kanon‐kun who's gone missing!!`
` ......I can't stand that!!"`
`"...............It's alright.`
` ...At least you know the truth, Milady."`
`"If only I know the truth, that's pointless!!`
` I found out by dying.`
` Truth belongs to living humans!!`
` If the truth doesn't remain, the dead won't be rewarded!!`
` They won't know why you risked your life!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, hahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!`
` Truly a splendid sight.`
` It is a rare honey that is sweeter than the laments of the dead."`
`"Lament, lament.`
` No matter how much you lament, the voices of the dead never reach the living."`
`"Damn it, damn iiiiiiit!!"`
`"It doesn't matter who!!`
` Hear my voice!!`
` Kanon‐kun isn't the culprit!!`
` Kanon‐kun's corpse was just erased!`
` Why, why don't you understand that?!!"`
`".........Milady."`
`"......I can't take this!!`
` It's so sad!`
` It's so frustrating!!"`
`"If it's like this, ......you died for nothing!!`
` The dead have no honor unless the living acknowledge it!`
` It doesn't matter who!`
` Realize!!`
` Realize!! Please!!`
` Kanon‐kun isn't the culprit!!"`
`"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahh, don't go, don't go, guys!!`
` Please, don't end it like this......!`
` Don't go, ......don't goooooooooooooo!!!"`
`Rosa proclaimed that this room should be sealed until the police came.`
`...The rest didn't want to suspect each other, so they happily accepted that.`
`......They accepted Kanon as the tentative culprit.`
`...Without even imagining how much disgrace that gave to the dead, they accepted it.`
`"......Milady... It's alright now...`
` ......Thank you......"`
`"Don't go!!`
` Don't go, guys!!"`
`"I beg you, come back!!`
` Don't leave us like this!!"`
`"Don't leave......Kanon‐kun......treated as the culprit!!!!!!!`
` Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!"`
`"It won't reach!!`
` The laments of the dead never reach!"`
`"You make me laugh, yes, that face of yours makes me laugh!!`
` You're thinking it will reach, aren't youuu?`
` It won't reach, Jessicaaaaaaa!!!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, wahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"That's no goddamn good."`
`"Huh?`
` .........Battler‐kun, did you say something?"`
`"Yeah, this is no good.`
` ...{i:It's no goddamn good at all}."`
`At the time everyone made to leave the room,`
` ...only Battler had his back to them, and he was still looking down at Jessica's body.`
`"What do you mean, ...it's no good at all?`
` Do you have some objection...?"`
`"I'll at least agree that we have to be vigilant.`
` ......But this talk about having Kanon‐kun be the culprit, sorry, but allow me to refuse."`
`"......Hoh.`
` So you're biting into this part.`
` If Kanon wasn't the culprit, and it wasn't my doing either, then how do you explain this locked room that Jessica's room has become...?"`
`".........Honestly, I've gotta throw my hands up there.`
` ...Seriously, why'd I say it's no goddamn good?"`
`"...I've gotta take responsibility for my own actions.`
` Ihihihihi...!`
` ...............I'm empty‐handed with zero weapons to argue with.`
` ...But you know, I won't stand here twiddling my thumbs anymore!! {f:5:Beatrice}!!"`
`"B‐......Battler‐sama......"`
`"......I‐is there some proof that Kanon‐kun isn't the culprit......?"`
`The expression that rose to those two faces was definitely expectant.`
`{n}......They didn't want to believe that Kanon was the culprit.`
`{n}In truth, they believed in Kanon.`
`So this expectation was because they wanted to be made to believe in him even more strongly!`
`"Then, Battler‐kun, which of the other servants do you suspect?`
` Gohda‐san?`
` Or is it Kumasawa‐san?"`
`"Quit it, Auntie Rosa.`
` ...I know the person called Kumasawa baa‐chan well.`
` ......She'll sometimes slack off on work, but she'll always try to make things fun for people.`
` ......She is not a person who would kill, not even if her eyes were dazzled by money."`
`"B‐......Battler‐sama........."`
`"And I've just met Gohda‐san yesterday.`
` ......Honestly, I still don't really understand him.`
` ......But there is one thing I understand."`
`"........................I, I........."`
`"......I've never seen someone look so happy to be making food.`
` ...You're the same.`
` The same as Kumasawa baa‐chan.`
` ......Gohda‐san likes to make people happy."`
`"As if a person like that could kill those who praised his own food as delicious, ...even if money was piled up in front of him!!"`
`"...Then, who do you think killed Jessica‐chan, Battler‐kun?`
` Who do you think shut Jessica‐chan up in a room that could only be locked by a master key?"`
`"Wait.`
` ......Before I argue about that, there's something I want to make clear.`
` I don't want to talk about, if so‐and‐so is not the culprit, then so‐and‐so is the culprit.`
` ...I just want to talk about how it's completely impossible for Kanon‐kun to be the culprit."`
`"You say that you can establish that Kanon isn't the culprit?`
` *cackle*, how?!"`
`"It's really simple.`
` ...It's something I came dangerously close to overlooking.`
` ......Beato!"`
`"Repetition requested!!`
` Say it if you can: "Kanon‐kun was holding a master key"!!"`
`"...........................Hoh...!"`
`"......Kanon‐kun wasn't holding a master key?!`
` How can you tell that?!"`
`"I heard what Gohda‐san said before.`
` Just before he split up with Kanon‐kun.`
` ...The part about when Jessica went to raid the VIP room."`
`".........Gohda‐san, you did a good job remembering it.`
` You protected Kanon‐kun's honor."`
`"......I,`
` ......I...`
`did...?!"`
`"I heard him talk about the same thing.`
` But I don't really understand!`
` Could you explain it, Battler‐kun?!"`
`"......That's right.`
` When Jessica unlocked the VIP room,`
` she borrowed the key from Kanon‐kun, {i:but didn't give it back}!`
` So Kanon‐kun wasn't holding a master key!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Or was he?"`
`"Certainly, Gohda has no recollection of the master key being returned to Kanon.`
` However, she might have returned it when Gohda wasn't looking!`
` How can you prove that it definitely didn't happen?!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*, if you could just search the pocket of Kanon's corpse, you could probably establish that, but you can't!!`
` It is impossible to prove!!"`
`"You're no goddamn good at all.`
` It's truly simple to prove, isn't it?"`
`"......No way...!`
` So, you're saying that Kanon‐kun wasn't holding a key?!"`
`"Yeah.`
` And to prove it, all you have to do is search Jessica.`
` ......Kanon‐kun's master key should be in Jessica's pocket.`
` Doctor Nanjo, would you check for us?"`
`"Ye‐......yes."`
`Nanjo dashed up to Jessica, and searched in her jacket pocket......`
`{n}Everyone...hoped for it.........!`
`"......mgh..."`
`...Please.`
` Be there............!!`
`"......Here it is!`
` Is this it?"`
`"...............Yes.`
` That is a master key.`
` Without a doubt."`
`At Genji's statement, there was a small "oooh" of joyful voices.`
`"That is Kanon‐kun's master key.`
` .........I'll say it again."`
`"‘Kanon‐kun isn't holding a master key’.`
` Therefore, there's no way he could have locked the door!!"`
`"......It certainly does...appear that way.`
` ......But Kanon‐kun was the last person to meet Jessica‐chan.`
` The fact that he's suspicious hasn't changed."`
`"Let's......give that a rest."`
`"......Huh?"`
`"Humans were originally supposed to be creatures that trust each other.`
` ...But in order to live in a tough world, we learn to be wary.`
` ...So we'll doubt anything.`
` We are sad creatures.`
` ...I won't deny that's our nature."`
`"...............But I won't permit you to come to a conclusion without proof!!`
` The suspicious are not the guilty, they are the innocent!!`
` Of course, the world is full of wolves.`
` I won't tell you to carelessly believe everyone!"`
`"But if you're going to say someone's guilty, prepare some perfect evidence!`
` Unless you can do that, never say someone is guilty because of speculation!!!"`
`"...............u......`
` That's........."`
`"......I was the one who said the suspicious were the guilty.`
` .........That was thoughtless.`
` I apologize."`
`"............Battler‐sama........."`
`"...W‐wonderful reasoning, Battler‐kun!`
` Thank you too, Gohda‐san.`
` Because of what you remembered, Kanon‐kun is cleared from suspicion!"`
`"N‐no, I... Hahahaha..."`
`Clap clap clap...`
` ...It was the dry sound of the witch's applause.`
`"Well done, well done.`
` ......Not a bad job."`
`".........Shit.`
` Did I just fall for a blatant bait piece...?"`
`"You wonderfully proved that at least Kanon couldn't lock the door to this room.`
` The servants should all have been holding master keys.`
` With that as a basis, Kanon was treated as the culprit, so you did a wonderful job of at least clearing away that suspicion.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`"......In that case.`
` ...How did the culprit who killed Jessica lock the door?`
` So that's the problem I have now."`
`"Tch.`
` ......I've been drawn into a development that went exactly like you wanted..."`
`"Right into my trap, yes...?`
` Furthermore, you said something outrageous about not doubting any of the other servants.`
` Wellll then, it'll be worth seeing how you gloss this over..."`
`"Shut your face.`
` ...Let's get this started.`
` I'm sure I'll be denied from all angles, ...but first I'll verify the definition of what it means for this room to be a locked room."`
`"Very well.`
` First,`
` {p:1:there are absolutely no types of hidden doors}.`
` {p:1:This door is the only way in or out}.`
` {p:1:The only way to lock this door is with Jessica's single key or the master keys, only one of which is held by each servant}."`
`"It is on the second floor, but it is probably possible to enter or leave through the window.`
` However,`
` {p:1:the window is locked from the inside}."`
`"......Let me flip over the chessboard right away.`
` ...If I start by arguing about the door and the lock, I probably won't leave the palm of your hand."`
`"Do as you like.`
` Well then, well then, what should I repeat?"`
`".........Repetition requested.`
` "Kanon‐kun was killed in this room"."`
`"Mmhm.`
` "{p:1:Kanon was killed in this room}".`
` Although I erased his corpse with magic, of course?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"And again, repetition requested.`
` "Kanon‐kun's corpse is in this room"."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` I decline.`
` I cannot repeat it.`
` ...Because I erased the corpse with magic.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"Of course you wouldn't.`
` ......There's got to be a secret hidden in there somewhere."`
`" ......Damn, where's the point of contention to this riddle?`
` .........Is it that they locked it without a master key?`
` Or is it how they managed to kill two people who were inside a room with the door locked?`
` Or is it how they managed to escape after killing them both?"`
`"......I hate to say it, but I'll have to tackle this one step at a time.`
` ...Repetition requested.`
` ......‘The last time it was locked was by a master key’."`
`"I also decline that.`
` *cackle*cackle*."`
`"......This declining thing is really vague.`
` I don't know if you decline because it's impossible to repeat, or whether you can repeat it and you're declining on purpose..."`
`"Back when discussing the lock to the chapel, you completely turned the tables on me.`
` When I have an advantage, there's no need to go out of my way to speak using the red, which carries risk.`
` That's all it is."`
`".........Yeah, I guess so.`
` ...At its heart, the red is something you use when you want to stop my strange theories."`
`"It is natural that I would use it to my advantage.`
` Because of the risk of it being quibbled with, I won't use it uselessly."`
`"...*cackle*cackle*.`
` Well then, what move will you come at me with next?`
` A move that puts Gohda or Kumasawa under suspicion would probably be the easiest to use, right...?"`
`"......Damn.`
` It's like you're leading me down a path, goddamn annoying...`
` Stay quiet a while, I'm thinking...!"`
`"Of course, this door is the same as the chapel.`
` {p:1:When locked, it does not permit any form of entry or exit}."`
`"I'll say more. {p:1:No trick could have the effect of locking the door from the outside without using a key}.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"Tch.`
` Damn you for always using red when I don't ask for it..."`
`............Let's back up.`
` ...Let me just think.`
`{n}I'll lay out everything I know.`
`First, there are two victims.`
`Jessica and Kanon‐kun.`
`...Kanon‐kun's corpse isn't here, but {f:5:Beatrice} admitted in red that Kanon‐kun was killed.`
`So even without a corpse, he's included as a victim.`
`There are a few questionable points.`
` And depending on which I focus on, my line of thought changes a lot.`
`First, after the culprit committed murder in this room, how did they lock it?`
`If we assume that the culprit was one of those holding a master key, it's extremely simple.`
`......But I want to avoid that if I can.`
`Because I would have to suspect Gohda‐san or Kumasawa‐san—no, in the worst case, even Shannon‐chan and Genji‐san.`
`At this point, I noticed something.`
`......I'm contradicting myself.`
`{n}I'm cutting my own throat.`
`I want to deny {f:5:Beatrice} no matter what.`
`{n}I want to erase the existence of that brutal, fickle, ridiculous witch!`
`In order to do that, I have to explain everything with humans, not magic.`
`......But that also means suspecting some human.`
`I don't want to suspect someone.`
`......Of course, if there was some clear proof, I would have to believe that person was the culprit,`
` ...but as long as that didn't happen, I didn't want to cast any suspicions.`
`Am I just green...?`
`{n}Am I just a kid who doesn't want to have my feelings, which tell me that at least this person or that person couldn't be a murderer, betrayed...?`
`I want to deny that it was a witch; I also want to deny that it was a human.`
`{n}.........Now I don't know what is what anymore...`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` In the first place, the only victory condition in our game regarded whether or not you could deny my existence.`
` ...Even though that alone was a game that put you at a disadvantage, you've increased the number of victory conditions all by yourself, and made your own victory difficult...!"`
`......It's just as she says.`
` ...If I started arguing that someone holding a master key was the culprit, this locked room could be easily broken.`
`......However, since the number of keys that could open this door are limited,`
` and furthermore it's clearly known who holds them,`
` saying that would mean that I was suspecting someone I knew well...`
`...No, ......have I just been averting my eyes?`
`In that locked room trick with the chapel, which had been exhilarating to destroy,`
` I had proposed that "someone stole the key from Maria's handbag, and returned it".`
` If that theory was right, then the question becomes who could have stolen the key from her handbag.`
`...Maria's handbag had probably been at its most unguarded when she was sleeping.`
`......In that case,`
` .........in addition to me,`
` ...George‐aniki and Jessica are also suspects.`
`George‐aniki or Jessica was the culprit?`
`{n}Or maybe an accomplice?!`
`......All of our parents had been killed, right?!`
`{n}And yet, ......and yet, one of us consented to that and assisted with the crime?!`
`We had lamented, mourned, and shed tears in the chapel.`
`{n}...And yet, one among us......had been lying?!`
`"......*cackle*cackle*.`
` That theory of yours about taking the key out of the handbag and putting it back cast a pronounced suspicion on the cousins, did it not...?"`
`"Quite impressive—in spite of that, you managed to act like you didn't notice,`
` and spoke your theory with such gusto...!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"D‐............damn it...`
` That doesn't guarantee that one of the family or the servants is the culprit!`
` If you snuck up on us hiding in a cardboard box, for example,`
` there's a good chance you could have slunk into our room when we were fast asleep and stolen the key, right?!"`
`"Mmm.`
` That would also be acceptable in that instance.`
` By suspecting me as the guest, the 19th person, you won't have to suspect them."`
`".........But then, what will you do about the lock to Jessica's room?`
` It's no trouble at all for me to open the lock with magic, but of course, I don't have a master key.`
` If you deny my magic, you also have to deny that I'm a suspect, you realize...?"`
`"And what that entails is suspecting one of you 18...!!"`
`"Tha‐......thanks for the lovely explanation.`
` ...I've been able to sort things out a bit."`
`"......My goal is to pursue how the 19th person, the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} guest {f:5:Beatrice}, committed the crimes.`
` If I do that, I won't have to suspect anyone!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` If you can do that, yes...!`
` Foolish man.`
` ......A room like this never needed to be a locked room at all.`
` After all, there are a total of six keys that can open it."`
`"And there were several who possessed those keys!`
` You can suspect any of them!`
` Suspect as much as you like!!`
` But you went to all the trouble of denying all of those, and made it a locked room yourself."`
`".........Understand?`
` This is a locked room born from your mental contradiction.`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` There's no one else, you closed that door yourself."`
`"......So accept that a witch opened it with magic,`
` ...or accept that someone I know is the culprit—those are my only two options, you're saying.`
` Damn, are you trying to fork the rook?!"`
`"I merely wanted to show you that this move also exists."`
`"......*cackle*.`
` So, what will you do, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeer?`
` Isn't it a truly simple problemmm...?`
` You just have to make sacrifices of that overly self‐confident cook and that hag who should have died yeeears ago.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"...............Damn it!!`
` So if I suspect Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san, everything's fine?!`
` That's no good!"`
`".........I can't think of Gohda‐san as the culprit!`
` I can't think of Kumasawa‐san as the culprit!!`
` But I won't accept you!!`
` Ever!!"`
`"In that case, they would have to enter the room without using magic or a master key,`
` kill Jessica and Kanon, and even erase Kanon's corpse without using magic."`
`"......How could it be done?!`
` How could it be done so that you can deny me and not suspect anyone at the same time?!!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"............Resign."`
`"Huh?`
` Battler‐kun, what did you say?"`
`"......I give up.`
` I was able to prove that Kanon‐kun couldn't have locked this door.`
` ......But that doesn't mean I was able to figure out who killed Jessica."`
`"N‐......no, ...that's more than enough...`
` Umm, ......for doing all that for Kanon‐kun,`
` ...thank you very much...!"`
`"......I don't want thanks.`
` After all, ......that means that you're under suspicion too."`
`"....................."`
`"...And sorry, Auntie Rosa.`
` ......It's not like I wanted to be defiant towards you.`
` I don't want to die either, and I want to find Dad and the rest's true killer.`
` ......Sorry for saying something that wasn't cooperative."`
`"......No, it's alright.`
` I was also a little rash.`
` Let's make up.`
` As auntie and nephew, we have to be friendly with each other.`
` ............Right?"`
`Auntie Rosa shifted the gun to one hand, and held out her other hand.`
`...I reached out, and for the time being, we shook hands.`
`Auntie's gaze was sharp.`
`{n}......In order to deny the witch, she would make anyone a sacrifice.`
`{n}...That's what her eyes told me.`
`And me...?`
`{n}I denied the witch.`
`{n}......But I wasn't prepared to lose anything.`
`I was probably the one who thought himself most ready to fight, ......and the one standing furthest from the truth.`
`With Jessica's death, it became certain that the culprit was hiding somewhere nearby, and that they would come after our lives if they had a chance.`
`According to Genji‐san, when tomorrow morning comes, the boat should arrive.`
`The boat has a radio, too.`
`{n}We'll probably be able to contact the police immediately with that.`
`We all gathered in the parlor, and decided to wait quietly until tomorrow.`
`I proposed that we should search throughout the mansion for clues about the culprit,`
` but Auntie Rosa rejected that, saying that if we put pressure on the culprit, or provoked them,`
` it might lead to a third murder.`
`...That was probably the right thing to do.`
`{n}Even if a bunch of amateurs like us investigated, there's no way we'd find anything.`
`It would be wisest to focus on protecting ourselves without doing anything unnecessary, and leave it to the police after tomorrow.`
`We had been tense in the beginning, but other than Auntie Rosa,`
` most of us had spent all morning watching TV and were getting bored, so our sense of danger had grown much less intense.`
`When we thought about it, even though there certainly had been six adults killed at once in the first murder,`
` that made us imagine that some back‐handed method like poison had been used.`
`And in the second murder, it was thought that those two had become sacrifices because they were unfortunately isolated from the rest of us.`
`From this, we imagined that there weren't a great number of culprits,`
` and they didn't have the ability to kill this large group gathered in the parlor all at once.`
`Right now, in this parlor, there was George‐aniki and me,`
` Maria,`
` Auntie Rosa,`
` Genji‐san, Gohda‐san, Shannon‐san, Kumasawa‐san, ......and finally Doctor Nanjo—a total of nine people were here.`
`Furthermore, Auntie Rosa was even armed with a gun.`
`Surely, with this many people staying in this room, they wouldn't be able to touch us easily.`
`That feeling of security, along with the passage of time, allowed us to recover from the shock of that morning bit by bit...`
`Incidentally, lunchtime had just ended for us.`
`{n}However, it had been a canned‐food lunch, a far cry from last night's dinner which Gohda‐san had skillfully made for us.`
`...Auntie Rosa too had suspected that poison had been used in the murder of those six people.`
`...So, we probably couldn't deny the possibility that the culprit had snuck into the kitchen during all that confusion in the morning, and mixed poison in with the ingredients there.`
`......Auntie Rosa had ordered all of us not to put anything into our mouths except safe foods like canned food, until the police came.`
`As a cook, Gohda‐san must have felt very let down.`
`As though he wanted to display his skill anyway, he said that he at least wanted to bring the plates and pile them up with canned food.`
`At first, Auntie Rosa had been reluctant, examining each one of the plates that were brought, but she hadn't been able to find anything to complain about,`
` and Gohda‐san's "Chef's Pick Canned Food Combo Lunch" had become a reality.`
`Gohda‐san had said something about taste being savored not just with the tongue, but with the eyes too.`
`...I found myself agreeing—it had been the same canned food we ate for breakfast, but it felt like something completely different...`
`"Uu, Battler.`
` Look, look.`
` Here, "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle".`
` Uu."`
`As I was sitting lazily on a sofa, with no desire to watch TV,`
` Maria came over, pulled a picture book out of her handbag, and held it out to me as she said that.`
`"......What is that book?`
` "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle"?`
` ..................Let's have a look‐see."`
`"Wolves and Sheep Puzzle".`
`{n}It was a phrase that Auntie Rosa had said this morning when we had gone to call on Jessica.`
`...At the time, I hadn't known what it meant, and then after that, there was the uproar when Jessica's body was found, so I'd forgotten about it completely.`
`The book that Maria held out to me looked like a foreign picture book or something that had been translated.`
`Opening it, I could tell that the book contained an assortment of puzzles.`
`"Uu.`
` So there's several wolves and sheep, okay?`
` And the puzzle is to take them to the other side using one boat."`
`"......Hmmmm?`
` I've heard of a game with rules like this.`
` So this is that, but with wolves and sheep?"`
`It was a very simple puzzle, passed on from long ago.`
`{n}Let's try one of the problems.`
`On the right bank, there are two wolves and two sheep.`
`{n}There is a boat that as many as two animals can ride on, and using it, you have to move all four of them to the opposite left bank.`
`There are two rules.`
`The first is regarding the boat.`
`{n}It can be paddled by wolves or sheep, and even just by one animal on its own.`
`{n}But it can only hold up to two.`
`The second is regarding the wolves.`
`{n}When they are greater in number than the sheep in that location, they attack the sheep and it's game over.`
`For example, at the start of the game:`
`{n}Both sheep ride the boat, and go to the other side.`
`{n}Then one sheep gets off, and the other goes back to the first bank.`
`......When it does, there are two wolves on the first bank.`
`{n}And a single sheep returns there.`
`When that happens, there are more wolves, so the sheep is attacked and it's game over.`
`On either bank or even the boat, there must not be more wolves than sheep.`
`It's a puzzle about how to shuttle them across in the boat under these conditions.`
`By the way, the right answer is: On the first turn, move both wolves to the opposite bank.`
`{n}Then one wolf comes back.`
`On the second turn, move two sheep to the opposite bank.`
`{n}Then one wolf comes back.`
`Then on the third turn, put that last wolf that was on the right bank on the boat and cross to the opposite bank, and congratulations, transport successful.`
`Partway, there may be the same number of wolves and sheep in the boat or on either side, but that isn't a problem.`
`You only lose when the number of wolves is greater.`
`This book symbolizes it using wolves and sheep, but there are probably lots of people who know this same game with a different symbolism...`
`It looked like Maria wanted to test whether I too could solve the puzzles she knew how to solve,`
` and she kept showing me different pages, saying "solve this one" and "this one's hard".`
`What had been happening when Auntie Rosa had said the name of this puzzle...`
`That's right.`
`...When we'd decided to go call Jessica, we had been talking about how many men should go,`
` and Auntie Rosa mentioned the "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle", and said that we should all go together......`
`".................................Wait a sec..."`
`That could only mean one thing.`
` ...Auntie Rosa was saying that there are "wolves" among us.`
`And when the number of wolves and sheep is balanced, we're safe, but when a situation comes up where that isn't the case, the wolves will bear their fangs—is that what she's thinking......?`
`At the time we had found our parents' corpses, Auntie Rosa was already suspecting that the servants might be "wolves".`
`While she didn't know whether it was all of them or just some, she had sniffed out the possibility that "wolves" were hiding among them.`
`......Well, yeah.`
`That murder scene was pretty damn elaborate.`
`{n}It's easy to imagine that there were multiple culprits.`
`And considering that she had that idea already in mind when we went to Jessica's room,`
` where Jessica had been alone with a servant, Kanon, and had been killed,`
` .........it isn't hard to imagine why Auntie Rosa had suspected the servants so persistently...`
`"All you servants.`
` Gohda‐san is going to the kitchen to wash the dishes.`
` Just in case, would you please all go with him?"`
`"My apologies, everyone.`
` Let us go as a group."`
`"......Shannon, Kumasawa.`
` Let's go."`
`"Yes, yes, coming.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐ho."`
`"Well then, George‐san, excuse me for now."`
`"Okay.`
` .........Take care.`
` Ah, Auntie Rosa, could I go as well?"`
`"I'm sorry, would you remain here, George‐kun?`
` There's something I want to talk to you about."`
`"......Is that so?`
` Sorry, Shannon.`
` Anyway, take care.`
` ...Don't be alone."`
`"...Yes..."`
`"Excuse me, Doctor Nanjo.`
` ......I wanted to consult with you about something."`
`"Yes, ......what might that be?`
` ........................"`
`The servants put the dishes and empty cans on the serving cart and started to head out into the corridor.`
`Behind them, Auntie Rosa was talking to Doctor Nanjo about something in a small voice.`
`"...Alright.`
` I will go."`
`"Yes, if you wouldn't mind."`
`Doctor Nanjo closed the book he had been reading, stood from the sofa, and followed after the servants...`
`Auntie Rosa stuck her head out into the hallway, and after watching them leave completely, she closed the door, and spoke.`
`"Listen, everyone.`
` Now everyone here is an Ushiromiya."`
`"......Hmm?`
` Yes, that is true..."`
`"So you're saying that you've chased out all of the "wolves"?`
` ......Auntie Rosa."`
`With that one sentence, Auntie Rosa's gaze grew sharp.`
`{n}...Apparently she had picked up on my sardonic tone.`
`......Auntie Rosa laughed lightly.`
`"...Your mind sure works fast, Battler‐kun.`
` I like clever kids.`
` It means there's less to explain."`
`"Uu.`
` Battler, smart...?`
` Can you solve this?`
` Hard one on page 64.`
` Uu!"`
`"Maria, sit there watching TV for a while.`
` Mama wants to talk with Battler‐kun and George‐kun."`
`"..................Uu."`
`"Auntie Rosa.`
` ...I heard about the puzzle from Battler‐kun.`
` ...I don't think it's bad to be very careful, but I think being too suspicious isn't good either."`
`"Whether the real culprit is {f:5:Beatrice} or not,`
` I think there is reason for us to suspect that the servants are in league with her."`
`"......In the first murder, where Nii‐san and the others were killed,`
` they'd been given a very brutal treatment, right?`
` Did that look like something that could be done alone?"`
`"............Maybe our mystery guest {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama worked all night and did it all."`
`"And the incident with the master keys involving the door to Jessica's room?`
` Isn't that proof that one of the servants was involved?"`
`"......nn.................."`
`Only a master key could have locked the door to Jessica's room.`
`{n}...In that case, we can only suppose that one of the servants locked it......`
`.........No,`
` ......wait.`
`"Flip over the chessboard.`
` ......That's strange, Auntie Rosa."`
`"After killing Jessica, why did the culprit go to all the trouble of locking the door?`
` It was inevitable that the owners of the master keys were gonna be suspected if they did that.`
` ......There was no need to deliberately lock the door."`
`"...Tha‐that's right.`
` It's just as Battler‐kun says!`
` They have no reason to deliberately go and do something that makes themselves suspicious."`
`"Yes.`
` That's an interesting thought.`
` Of course, I also thought that."`
`"......If that's so, then the person who locked it wanted to cast suspicion on the servants, and locked that door without a master key.`
` But that's impossible.`
` Right?"`
`......That's right.`
` If there was a trick that could lock the door without a master key, this would be a good disguise aimed at casting doubt on the servants.`
`...If the culprit wanted to isolate us and attack us one by one, this trick was a very effective one that could even give rise to paranoia.`
`However, there was no way to lock that door without using a master key...`
`"How can you make the claim that there's no way to lock the door without using a master key?`
` Isn't that a Devil's Proof, like Rudolf nii‐san was talking about?`
` {i:Maybe it was locked by a method we can't think of}."`
`"Even if we can't think of it, that doesn't disprove that there was some unknown trick."`
`"............Well, sure, but...`
` So is that it?`
` The suspicious ones are guilty...?"`
`"I don't know the practical details of the trick, but I have a general idea.`
` My apologies, but if we suppose that Kanon‐kun was the culprit, it can be explained extremely easily.`
` Even as to why there was no corpse."`
`"Huh......`
` But Kanon‐kun wasn't holding a master key, right?!`
` Putting aside the other servants, at least Kanon‐kun shouldn't have been able to lock the door!"`
`"......I see.`
` ...So that's why you told us to search in the closet and everywhere else right after we entered Jessica's room.`
` ......Auntie Rosa, ...your mind works faster than I could imagine judging by your normal appearance."`
`"The brain speed of a little sister is always the big sister's minus 1.`
` ...I feel glad that there's no one I need to worry about now."`
`George‐aniki realized that she was referring to Auntie Eva,`
` and seemed a little disturbed about how he should take that nasty remark...`
`"......I, I'm sorry.`
` Could you explain it so that even I can understand?"`
`"Kanon‐kun's master key was in Jessica‐chan's pocket, closed up inside a locked room.`
` After the door was locked, it should have been impossible for him to pull a stunt like putting it in her pocket from outside the room...!"`
`"That's not it, Aniki.`
` ......If it was done in the way Auntie Rosa imagines, ......this trick could only be used by Kanon‐kun."`
`"...And, the door could be locked without a key, while the master key was still in Jessica's pocket.`
` ......And, as a result, his corpse would also disappear."`
`"H‐......how?!`
` How would he lock the door without a key?!"`
`"It's simple.`
` George‐kun, when you return home, you lock the door, right?`
` You twist the knob, click, right?"`
`"Huh...?!`
` .........C‐`
`...could it be...`
` ......No, but...`
`...Kanon‐kun wasn't anywhere......"`
`"...It looks like you've got it, Aniki.`
` .........That's what Auntie Rosa was searching inside the room for."`
`"......She was searching for Kanon‐kun, who had locked the door from the inside, stuck the key in Jessica's pocket,`
` and was hiding somewhere, waiting for us to go away."`
`The simplest locked‐room trick.`
` ...In other words, to hide inside the locked room after committing the murder.`
`...And if he could get out after those who discovered the body left, it would create a perfect locked‐room murder......`
`"We searched that room, but we couldn't find anything.`
` ...But, that doesn't mean we can rule out something like a secret hidden passage in that room that only the servants know about."`
`"I don't know where that might be hidden,`
` but if we assume that there was a hidden passage, we can say for certain that it was impossible for anyone except him."`
`"..................You know, that line of reasoning,`
` ...it was the first thing I thought of, too.`
` ......It's the reasoning I hate the most, so I wanted to destroy it in the very beginning..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...`
` "{p:1:Kanon was killed in this room}", yes?"`
`"Because you seemed to suspect Kanon as the culprit, you made me repeat this to destroy that possibility right away.`
` I understand, I understand.`
` *cackle*......"`
`"...So this is what I thought of next.`
` A theory that there were actually three people in that room.`
` Jessica and Kanon‐kun were victims.`
` And the culprit, the guest {f:5:Beatrice}, was also there with them."`
`"You wanted to make it "the human me" who committed the crime without using magic.`
` I see, a strange theory that fits you perfectly.`
` *giggle*giggle*."`
`"......I guessed that you killed those two, then locked the door from the inside.`
` And you carried Kanon‐kun's corpse using some secret method that normal people wouldn't notice.`
` ......In other words, you used a secret door to escape."`
`"But you told me it in red.`
` ...You said that there are no types of hidden doors in that room."`
`"Indeed.`
` No secret passage exists unknown to you all.`
` Was it Knox, or was it Van Dine?`
` It seems that in mystery novels, there must never be hidden passages, no matter what.`
` I also follow that etiquette."`
`"In other words, even without having to thoroughly search a room, great detectives can state with confidence that there are no secret passages.`
` .........*cackle*cackle*, humans have it so easy with their little detective games."`
`"Damn you, talking so big...`
` Thanks.`
` Thanks to the witch's arrangement, I can say for sure that the room doesn't have a hidden door without searching the whole thing."`
`"Indeed.`
` {p:1:There are no hidden doors in this room}.`
` {p:1:There is no way to get in or out other than the door and the windows}."`
`"......Which means...`
`...that theory Auntie Rosa's so confident in...`
`...is wrong."`
`"...Plus, frustratingly, it's impossible to disprove that theory.`
` ......If you, the witch, say in red`
` "`
`{p:1:there are no hidden doors}", then it's settled."`
`"......However, no matter how much a human like me tries to argue against her, Auntie Rosa probably won't accept it.`
` {i:Humans can't prove there's no hidden door}."`
`"It's a Devil's Proof.`
` ...............Damn.`
` Sure is convenient being a witch..."`
`"......No way!`
` You're calling Kanon‐kun the culprit because of a hidden door that we don't even know exists...`
` I...can't accept that."`
`"If you can't accept that, tell me some reasoning that's easier to accept, then?`
` .........There is none.`
` I've been thinking the whole time.`
` There's nothing but this!"`
`".............................."`
`"George‐kun, you had a good relationship with Shannon‐chan, right?`
` So I think it would be hard for you to accept that all of the servants are the culprits."`
`"I also don't want to believe that Shannon‐chan is one of the culprits.`
` .........But whether it's all of them or not, the culprit, or maybe an accomplice, is definitely in that group.`
` You must not fail to see that!"`
`"......If you thought that there were more wolves in addition to Kanon‐kun,`
` ...then causing that uproar by saying that Kanon‐kun was the culprit in Jessica's room was to see the servants' reactions...?"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` And as a result, I began to suspect them even more.`
` ......I'm certain there are wolves among the servants.`
` Certain.`
` And, just like the "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle", while they are normally docile, they will surely attack if they get the chance."`
`"......Jessica‐chan was a lone sheep on the boat.`
` ......In that puzzle, they may not attack when there is a balance between wolves and sheep, but our puzzle is different.`
` Depending on the opportunity and the number of people, they'll attack even if there is a balance.`
` Just like when Jessica‐chan was killed!"`
`".........Th‐there's something I don't like!`
` In that case, Shannon, who you sent to the kitchen, is in a dangerous situation, isn't she?!!`
` We should also go to the kitchen right now!`
` No matter who might or might not be a wolf!`
` If we can form a balance by gathering together, I think we should maintain that!!"`
`"......Shannon‐chan went to see Father along with Genji‐san.`
` She was isolated then, but she wasn't killed."`
`"Because Genji‐san wasn't a wolf either?"`
`"......No!`
` Because they were both wolves!!"`
`"Shannon isn't the kind of person who would take part in a crime!!`
` Even if it's you, Auntie Rosa, I cannot ignore that.`
` I demand that you take back what you just said...!"`
`"...I hate to say this in front of Aniki, but that argument...`
`...feels just like something Auntie Eva would say.`
` If we can't argue back, then you automatically assume that you're right.`
` ......Looks like you can't fight your blood after all, Auntie."`
`".........Even I don't think of myself as very praiseworthy right now."`
`"But you know what? I'm a mother!`
` I would even become a demon to protect Maria's safety.`
` Honestly speaking, I wish I could just shut myself away somewhere alone with Maria."`
`"......But I also plan to act as a mother to you two.`
` Right now, you are as good as my children.`
` ......You may not be my own children, ...but I won't forsake you.`
` .........Ever."`
`"......Sure, thanks."`
`"I just wanted to warn you not to be careless, as your mother.`
` {i:Always remain where I can see you}.`
` I will protect you."`
`"And at the same time, you'll be observing us to make sure we aren't "wolves".`
` ...Yeah, thanks a lot for that.`
` Can you prove that you aren't a "wolf" yourself?"`
`"Yes, I can."`
`"That's a quick answer.`
` How?"`
`"With this.`
` ...This is my proof."`
`Auntie Rosa held up the gun, and pointed the barrel at me.`
`But that was only for an instant.`
`She immediately lowered the gun, laughing impishly.`
`{n}......But to me, the time I spent staring down the barrel of the gun had felt like an eternity.`
`"...How does that gun prove that you aren't the culprit, Auntie Rosa?"`
`"Think about it.`
` What if I were the culprit?`
` Do you think I would let by this once‐in‐a‐lifetime chance I got when the servants left?"`
`"I could just shoot you both, bang, and all that's left is to come out with a fitting excuse.`
` Something like, {f:5:Beatrice} appeared outside the window and shot at us with a gun.`
` I would claim that I fired two shots back at her, and throw the two shots' worth of empty cartridges onto the floor."`
`"That's a crazy wild argument, but it does make sense. Ihihihi!"`
`"There's something Krauss nii‐san often used to say.`
` Might makes right.`
` .........I wonder if this proves that?"`
`".........I'm sorry, you two.`
` I've lost a lot of my composure after all these crimes since morning.`
` You know how I normally am, so right now I must seem on‐edge and a little short‐tempered."`
`"...But understand.`
` I want to protect you from the malicious culprit.`
` I will become a demon to do that.`
` That's all there is to it.`
` ......I'm sorry for saying something that's angered you.`
` Battler‐kun, George‐kun.`
` ...Let's make up."`
`George‐aniki was wearing an unsatisfied expression.`
`{n}...He probably couldn't forgive the damage done to Shannon's honor.`
`...What about me...?`
` Several bits of circumstantial evidence hint strongly at the servants' participation.`
`......I don't want to believe that one of them is the culprit, or possibly colluding with the culprit,`
` ...but in the current situation, that's nothing but wishful thinking.`
`Who should I believe?`
`In the first place, who is the culprit?`
`{n}Are there accomplices?`
`{n}If so, how many?!`
`......I feel like I'm constantly only suspecting the people connected to all this.`
`...I find myself quickly forgetting about that 19th person,`
` the guest, {f:5:Beatrice}, who came yesterday and boldly called herself the Golden Witch.`
`I haven't actually seen her face.`
`I've heard that she's like a double of the witch in that portrait,`
` but because I haven't seen her directly, no matter how hard I try, I can't really feel like there are 19 people on this island.`
`...So I easily slip into the illusion that the culprit is one of the 18...`
`Damn it......`
` Come out, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`If you're the bad guy, then act like the bad guy, and show yourself, laughing in a high‐pitched voice and looking down on us.`
`Just like a bad guy in one of those dramas who, even once they're exposed as the culprit,`
` aggressively says "is there any proof?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` Is there any proof?"`
`"Shut up, you keep your trap shut for a minute..."`
`There were five humans in the kitchen, but it was very quiet, filled only with the sound of the rain.`
`It was only accented by the sound of Shannon and Kumasawa washing the dishes.`
`Gohda was using the leftovers from breakfast and lunch as ingredients for a servants' soup.`
`......Rosa had suspected that poison might have been added to the food, so they had decided to eat canned food, but it hadn't really been filling.`
`But Gohda thought that she was being too careful.`
`{n}So he was spontaneously creating a soup to be served only to those that wanted to eat it.`
`Shannon and Kumasawa were washing the dishes that the food had been arranged on.`
`On the inside, they thought maybe Gohda should be the one to wash them since he had been the one who wanted the food on plates in the first place,`
` but they left their complaints unsaid for the time being.`
`Genji and Nanjo were facing each other across a crude chess set which had seen many years.`
`...It had still only just begun.`
`And because the opening game of the experienced players had been endlessly refined,`
` it looked like a ritual where they just moved specified pieces in a specified order.`
`"That's a nice aroma...`
` You wouldn't get this from canned food."`
`"It was made only from sealed ingredients, so there won't be any poison mixed in."`
`"I have made enough for everybody, so please, eat.`
` Of course, I will also taste for poison.`
` Please feel secure and eat."`
`"That really is a nice aroma.`
` Gohda‐san, your makeshift servant meals really are delicious."`
`"It's natural that you can create delicious food if you buy delicious ingredients.`
` ......My teacher taught me that perfecting your ability to make delicious food from whatever is at hand is what makes you a true cook."`
`"That was a good teacher.`
` Thanks to him, it looks like I shall be able to enjoy some truly delicious soup."`
`"......Although it is a shame that it was made from ingredients intended for all of the family members to eat."`
`"I'm sure that Rosa‐san is also tired after everything that happened this morning.`
` It is only natural."`
`"But thanks to that, we get to eat some soup made from delicious ingredients, hoh‐hoh‐ho."`
`Rosa had fervently told everyone that they didn't realize the danger they were in, and that they must suspect that poison was mixed in with the food.`
`The atmosphere in that place had led to their agreement,`
` but their hunger wouldn't be overcome by that momentary emotion.`
`"Ironically, it has become a soup that we normally wouldn't be able to savor.`
` If possible, I would like to also serve it to everyone in the parlor, but..."`
`"......Seeing as that goes against Rosa‐sama's instructions, you'd better not.`
` ......Those who want to eat it can do so."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` Skillfully taking a breather when no one is looking is one of the things you learn as a servant, after all."`
`Kumasawa laughed loudly, and Shannon and Gohda laughed with her.`
`It seemed that, in an area where only their fellow servants were gathered, they could be very relaxed.`
`Shannon didn't like Gohda's occasional dishonesty,`
` but she knew that there was no falsehood in his childish smile when he cooked,`
` nor in his desire that people enjoy his food.`
`So even though it was a little aggravating to be made to wash the dishes,`
` she couldn't really hate him.`
`However, they couldn't have dreamed that Rosa was calling them wolves in the parlor at exactly the same moment that they were spending their time peacefully like this......`
`At that time, several of the servants heard a sound like something was being dragged, and then a thump.`
`When a servant was out carrying a mountain of trash bags on a rainy day,`
` or doing some work in a raincoat, they would create exactly this kind of noise and presence as they returned and hovered around the back door.`
`So after hearing that sound, at first, none of them noticed anything out of the ordinary...`
`But they quickly realized.`
` ............In a situation where everyone was either in the kitchen or the parlor, who in the world was at the back door...?!`
`As the servants all looked at each other, they checked to make sure that each one of them knew what that sound meant.`
`"Who, ..........who could it be......?"`
`The servants knew the mansion's layout well.`
`So they understood how unimaginable it would be for someone from the parlor to actually go outside in this typhoon,`
` go all the way around, and come up to this back door.`
`Then was it Kinzo?`
` ...They found it even more difficult to imagine that Kinzo, who never left his study even under normal conditions,`
` would dash out into the middle of this typhoon for no apparent reason, and come to the back of the house, where only low‐class people came in or out.`
`"......Tha‐`
`......that wasn't...`
`our imagination, was it......?"`
`".............Awawawawawawawawa..."`
`Shannon and Kumasawa drew close together, fearfully looking at the back door...`
`"...Who, ...who is it......?"`
`As Gohda fearfully approached the back door, he called out.`
`{n}......And he checked with his eyes the location of a butcher's knife set on a nearby sink.`
`......He didn't pick it up yet.`
`{n}Because there was still a possibility that this was a member of the family.`
`{n}However, that possibility wasn't possible...`
`There was no response from across the door to Gohda's initial question.`
`{n}...Maybe his voice had been so quiet that it hadn't reached through all the wind and rain outside.`
`".........Genji‐san."`
`"......Yes.`
` .........Stand back, Doctor Nanjo and the women."`
`"...Who, ......who in the world could it be......"`
`Genji took a knife with a classical design from a stationery box placed near the chess set.`
`...It was something to be used instead of a paper knife to open envelopes for invoices and bills.`
`But it was fundamentally a knife.`
`{n}So the blade on it could injure someone...`
`Genji hid it in his sleeve with a well‐practiced manner.`
`{n}Then he too approached the back door, and signaled to Gohda with a silent nod.`
`Gohda cautiously approached the back door, .........and slowly started to open it......`
`"Wa...wahyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...!!!"`
`The figure of a person suddenly shuffled into sight, landed on its knees, and fell over.`
`{n}Gohda fell backwards onto his backside in shock.`
`That figure was soaked with rain, smeared with mud, and drenched with blood...`
`"K‐............Kanon‐kun?!`
` Kanon‐kun!!"`
`".........Kanon.`
` Are you alright...?`
` Doctor Nanjo...!"`
`It was Kanon.`
`......His breath was feeble, ......and the puddles of mud he left quickly became drenched bright‐red.`
`When Nanjo held him and turned him face up, there was a deep, gruesome scar right in the center of his chest, as though he had been run through with a spear or something.`
`Even now, deep‐red blood poured out from there...!`
`"Th‐th‐th‐...this is horrible...`
` Wh‐what shall we do—first aid kit? First aid kit?!"`
`"Kanon‐san, put your hand against the wound!`
` Please, push firmly!`
` Let's carry him to the bed in the servant room!!`
` Everyone, please, lend a hand."`
`"C‐come now, Kanon‐san!`
` Please, hang in there a little longer...!"`
`"Hang in there!!`
` It's alright now!!`
` So don't take your hand from the wound...!!"`
`"Anyway, let's carry him to the servant room.`
` ......Kumasawa, inform Rosa‐sama that we have found Kanon."`
`"Wai‐.........wait.........`
` ......Not...`
`......Rosa‐sama........."`
`"...Please wait!`
` Kanon‐san said not Rosa‐sama..."`
`"......Wh‐what do you mean, Kanon‐kun...!"`
`"............Not now.`
` Let's carry him to the servant room quickly.`
` Kumasawa, don't tell Rosa‐sama yet.`
` ...We'll do it after we hear the situation from Kanon."`
`"Y‐......yes......`
` ......hiiiiii..."`
`After appearing in this horrible state, he had said not to tell Rosa.`
`......That could only mean something very disquieting.`
`{n}......An eerie sense of panic rose to their faces...`
`"C‐come now, everyone!`
` Let's hurry and carry him...!`
` Quickly, quickly...!"`
`Kanon's wound was unbelievably deep,`
` ...and judging from Nanjo's pale face, it was almost a miracle that he was still conscious...`
`"......This is......horrible...`
` It appears that he has been stabbed with something like a spear.`
` I‐if it hasn't reached the lungs, I might be able to do something......`
` Anyway, stop the bleeding......!"`
`"u...guo......aaaaga!!!"`
`No matter how much Nanjo tried to wipe off that gushing deep‐red blood, ...he couldn't wipe it he couldn't wipe it he couldn't wipe it all away...!`
` And each time, the wound was aggravated, causing Kanon to cry in anguish...`
`"Kanon‐kun, Kanon‐kun Kanon‐kun!`
` Hang in there... Hang in there...!!"`
`"Doctor Nanjo!`
` A new towel...!`
` ...How...horrible...!!"`
`"What is his condition...?"`
`".........In all honesty, ...it is so severe that I cannot believe he is alive...`
` Maybe the location of the stab was fortunate...`
` But the blood loss is too horrible...!`
` A blood transfusion is necessary, but that's impossible until tomorrow...!"`
`"......u...`
`...*cough*cough*!!`
` Ro‐`
`......Rosa‐sama...`
`......she......`
`ugaaaaaa!!"`
`"D‐don't talk, Kanon‐kun!`
` Your wound will open...!"`
`"......Rosa‐sama...came...`
`......t‐`
`......to Milady and...`
`...me, and........."`
`"Wh‐......what did you say......"`
`"Rosa‐sama......did...?`
` Oooooh... Could that mean, could that mean..."`
`"......Are you certain?"`
`"Yes.........`
` ......I'm certain......it was Rosa‐sama........."`
`"Come now, don't speak any more...!`
` Kumasawa‐san, please grab another first aid kit!"`
`".........Genji‐san.`
` ......Is it possible Rosa‐sama......did such a thing?"`
`"............I don't know."`
`Disregarding Nanjo and Kumasawa, who were struggling hard and stained with blood as they tried to stop the bleeding, Genji and Gohda faced each other...`
`......Because if what Kanon had said was the truth,`
` ......Rosa was the culprit who killed Jessica.`
`"Curse you, Rosa......`
` How could you do that...to Milady......`
` ...I'm gonna kill you......ugnnnggg...!"`
`Kanon screamed even more hatefully...`
`{n}...His hate‐filled voice made it seem like he had seen Jessica being harmed right before his eyes.`
`"......Cer‐certainly, Rosa‐sama may have had a reason to kill Milady.`
` If the Ushiromiya family was wiped out, the inheritance would all go to Rosa‐sama..."`
`"If so, Battler‐sama and George‐sama are in danger...!`
` Not only is Rosa‐sama holding a gun, but right now, they are the only ones in the parlor...!`
` Genji‐san, isn't this quite perilous......?!"`
`"................................."`
`".............................."`
`Shannon suddenly ran out into the corridor.`
`...Her expression was complex and tragic, as though she didn't know what to believe...`
`Shannon ran.`
` To where?`
`......The inside of the mansion had been scrupulously cleaned, so they probably wouldn't be easy to find.`
`She might find some if she searched the rose garden, but they would probably have all been lost in this wind and rain...`
`That's right, ......the boiler room isn't cleaned very often.`
`{n}...If she went there, ......she might be able to find some...`
`Shannon ran down the stairs to search for {i:those} in the underground boiler room...`
`Had some medicine taken effect at the brink of death,`
` or had Kanon finally stopped even feeling pain?`
`...For the time being, Kanon had at least gotten over his painful gasping.`
`Nanjo apparently didn't think of this as that great of a trend, and didn't let his eyes off Kanon for a second.`
`Kumasawa firmly gripped Kanon's hand, and kept encouraging him, so that his will to stay alive didn't fall asleep.`
`Genji and Gohda seemed bewildered at how to deal with the truth that Kanon had risked his life to deliver...`
`".........I believe Rosa‐sama's gun had four or five shots loaded."`
`"That is no small number.`
` ...But loading cartridges into that gun should require quite a lot of practice.`
` We might unfortunately allow her to get one shot off, but if everyone attacks her at once, we should be able to take the gun from her before she shoots again..."`
`".........On this island, we may have a doctor, but there's no medicine, and no hospital.`
` ......If you're shot in the wrong place, ...you're dead."`
`"I understand that, but...`
` More importantly, if we don't move quickly, there is also the possibility that another crime will occur...!`
` I get the feeling that Rosa‐sama skillfully chased us out.`
` There is a possibility that George‐sama and Battler‐sama are being killed right about now...!"`
`"..........................."`
`"......Ho...hohohohoho.`
` If the opponent is so dangerous, wouldn't it be better if we didn't provoke them too much...?"`
`"But there is still much time before tomorrow comes...!`
` We can't even imagine what strategy she will use!`
` Genji‐san, we should be the ones to make the first move.`
` If we can at least take the gun from her under some pretext, things might work out...!"`
`"There are four or five cartridges, are there not?`
` That means there aren't enough to kill all of us...`
` If we don't carelessly provoke her, surely even Rosa‐sama wouldn't recklessly—"`
`"............No, she said it.`
` She said she'll massacre all of us."`
`Kanon, who they thought had been sleeping quietly, suddenly started talking brightly.`
`Almost like he had been awake the whole time and had suddenly opened his mouth.`
`He looked firm and steady, and Nanjo was slightly relieved, but thinking of the deepness of that wound, he just couldn't wipe away a certain creepy feeling.`
`......He knew because he was a doctor.`
`Kanon should have been expected to fall unconscious after losing so much blood.`
`{n}And yet somehow, he had preserved his awareness so clearly.`
`......Youth?`
` Or tenacity?`
`{n}...Sometimes the power of human life did surpass common knowledge......`
`When they had stopped the bleeding, to make sure there were no foreign objects inside the affected area,`
` Nanjo had groped around a bit inside the bleeding hole with tweezers, and the great depth of the wound had surprised him.`
`...The wound had certainly reached as far as his lungs.`
`......And yet, ...and yet...`
`{n}......No, on the other hand, the fact that he is alive is fortunate...`
`......But Kanon had spoken clearly.`
`{n}...He had hatefully said that the one named Rosa had created this wound, and was repeating curses and enraged words.`
`"...She wants to kill everyone by any means necessary before the typhoon passes, so that she can have the Master's wealth all to herself.`
` She told me that clearly."`
`".........Damn...!`
` What a person...`
` Genji‐san, what should we do?!`
` Do we also not need some kind of weapons...?"`
`"......I can't believe it so suddenly.`
` ......That Rosa‐sama would do something like......"`
`"Genji‐sama, it isn't a question of whether you believe or not.`
` She told me.`
` I heard it.`
` {f:5:Why} won't you believe me?"`
`"D‐don't get up...`
` You'll worsen your wound..."`
`Kanon sat up on the bed, and spoke to Genji, who was making no effort to believe Kanon's story.`
`"She will definitely kill all of us.`
` She's surely killed all of the people in the parlor by now.`
` If we don't kill her first, it will absolutely be us who are killed first.`
` Just like how I was killed first, everyone else will also be killed first.`
` Kill or be killed.`
` Kill or be killed kill or be killed."`
`"...K‐.........Kanon‐san, ......you...`
` ......Does it really not hurt...?"`
`"......Oh, this?`
` It isn't a serious wound."`
`"Wh‐...what do you mean, not a serious wound, ...you......"`
`"It really isn't a big deal.`
` It doesn't hurt at all anymore—it really isn't a serious wound."`
`As Kanon said that, he began to untie his own bandages which had been painstakingly wrapped...`
`The gruesome hole in his chest was immediately exposed...`
`"K‐Kanon‐san...!`
` You mustn't do something like that!`
` Quickly, lie down...!"`
`"I said it's fine.`
` ......Look.`
` See...?`
` It's...not...a serious wound, right...?"`
`Kanon showed off his gaping wound, which was still slowly spitting out foamy blood.`
`...Everyone averted their eyes reflexively.`
`"See, I told you that it wasn't a serious wound at all..."`
`"S‐......stop that... You mustn't play with your wound......"`
`"...Look, see?`
` ......It isn't a deep wound...at all.`
` .........Look.`
` ..................Look."`
`Kanon held up two fingers, showed them to everyone, and slowly started to stick them into the gruesome wound right in the center of his chest...`
`......Plunging, slimy, squishy, wet.`
`{n}The fingers...went in deep...to the base...`
` ......Squich, gloop, blorp...`
`"Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii...!!`
` K‐K‐K‐Kanon‐san, stop it, stop it...!!"`
`Having stuck his fingers completely into his chest......up to their base,`
` ......he slowly pulled them out in exactly the same way...`
`The fingers he pulled out were stained a sticky, solid, deep‐red color, and there was even a thread hanging...`
`...The fingers were, all the way to their base, covered......in deep red...`
`"......Y‐`
`.........you...`
` ......Wh‐wh‐wh‐what in the world.................."`
`".........See?`
` It is...not a serious wound...at all, you see?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`Just then, the door opened vigorously, and Shannon appeared.`
`...Even after she saw Kanon stained with fresh blood, her impregnable expression didn't falter.`
`"......Hey, Nee‐san.`
` Where'd you go?`
` I'm on the verge of death here, where'd you go?"`
`"Well.`
` I went to the boiler room.`
` Looking for something.`
` .........More importantly, I want to check.`
` Are you really...Kanon‐kun?"`
`"......Huh, ......huhh...?"`
`It was only natural.`
` Everyone believed he was Kanon.`
`{n}So they couldn't understand the meaning of Shannon's question.`
`When they looked, they noticed that Shannon was holding a handkerchief in her hand.`
`It was filthy, and looked like she had wiped up some trash or dust.`
`{n}And while holding that, she approached Kanon, .........and drew close to his legs.`
`"What is that......?"`
`"It's a handkerchief with a spider's web wiped onto it."`
`".....................`
` ...Why something like that?"`
`"If you're Kanon‐kun, you should be alright.`
` ......But if {i:spiders are your natural enemy}, I thought you might hate it."`
`"...........................`
` Hahaha, oh no.`
` Why would I hate spiders?"`
`"Sorry, I'll try it."`
`"......Sha‐...Shannon‐san."`
`When Shannon brought that handkerchief close to Kanon's thigh, ......something happened in an instant.`
`It happened all at once.`
` The human eye couldn't have followed it.`
`Kanon jumped back like a wild goat, ...fleeing from the thing Shannon was holding.`
`And his arm drew trails with some kind of afterglow that flashed purple.`
`They were three beautiful purple trails drawn in an arc, and they were traced across the throats of Nanjo and Kumasawa, who had been tending to him.`
`And Nanjo and Kumasawa's throats......had opened like gaping mouths, ...and it was the very instant before the blood was about to start spewing out.`
`The third purple trail should have traced across Shannon's throat.`
`{n}But Shannon wasn't there.`
`Because Genji, who had been behind her, had wrapped his own arm around Shannon's neck and pulled her back.`
`This all happened in an instant.`
`"...........................!!!"`
`In the instant Gohda tried to think fast in an attempt to understand this scene, the frozen moment in time shattered.`
`Blood spewed forcefully from Nanjo and Kumasawa's necks, which had been torn open.`
`Still mid‐jump, Kanon wall‐kicked off a picture frame that had been hanging from the wall behind him, springing forward just like a cat, and aiming for Shannon's throat again.`
`But Kanon's target once again disappeared from in front of him.`
` Because Genji had pulled Shannon again, and the two of them had fallen onto the ground, keeping flat to the floor.`
`"Nice reflexes, you senile old piece of furniture!!"`
`"......Gohda!"`
`"Uu...uooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhh!!"`
`Gohda wasn't an idiot either.`
` Even if he couldn't fully understand what was going on, he at least realized that if this "Kanon" wasn't seized, his own life would also be in peril.`
`He sprung at Kanon with his huge body, pushing him up against the wall with his weight and physical strength.`
`"Uuuoooooooooooooooooohhh...! Ooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"Let...me...go, you fatass!!"`
`The tips of the fingers on Kanon's right hand began to trace out another purple trail.`
`And when he raised that blade‐hand up, aiming to strike at Gohda's back, there was a loud thunk.`
`Because Kanon's raised blade‐hand had been pinned to the wall.`
`He couldn't tear his palm away from the wall.`
`Sticking out from it was the knife Genji had thrown.`
`Under normal circumstances, it should have been surprising to see someone as old as Genji handle a knife so skillfully,`
` but in this abnormal space, no one paid it much mind.`
`"Genji‐sama, here...!"`
`"......Yes."`
`Genji took the handkerchief with the spiderweb stuck to it from Shannon.`
`{n}And he approached Kanon, who was pinned to the wall by Gohda's massive body and the knife.`
`"Sto‐stop it...!!`
` Don't co—Don't come near me with that...!!`
` Stop it, sto‐stop!!"`
`"Gyaooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`When Genji pushed the handkerchief up against Kanon's face,`
` ...there was a sound just like the one you hear when you set meat on a red‐hot iron plate.`
`Of course, the smell was the same too.`
` As he was burned and inflamed, festering in filthy red and black, and cried out in his death throes, Kanon's body burst open and scattered.`
`It was almost as though a balloon filled with gold leaf had popped.`
`{n}The entire servant room was completely buried under a storm of gold leaf—no, a rabble of gold butterflies...`
`Those butterflies began to softly fade into nothingness, as though dissolving into water, no, into the air itself,`
` ......and afterwards, all that was left was the three of them sitting on their behinds, stained with blood.`
`However, not everyone was just stained with blood.`
`{n}Some of them were lying on the ground, vomiting blood themselves.`
`"...Kumasawa...!`
` ......Doctor Nanjo...!`
` ....................."`
`A slit so sharp that it looked like it could cut your finger if you touched it was opened wide, causing large amounts of blood to keep pouring out...`
`"What was that, .........j‐...just now............"`
`"..........................."`
`".........Gohda.`
` Have you been injured?"`
`"I, I am alright...`
` But.........what did we see?!`
` What happened?!`
` E‐ev‐ev‐......even though I definitely pushed that thing against this wall with this very hand!"`
`"{i:I cannot understand what happened}...!!"`
`Gohda looked at his own hand.`
`The bright‐red blood left from his scuffle with Kanon...definitely remained.`
`...And yet, Kanon was nowhere to be seen.`
`Because he had disappeared.`
`{n}He had turned into gold butterflies and scattered.`
`Gohda kept screaming alone that he had no clue about what was going on.`
`Shannon sobbed in front of Nanjo's and Kumasawa's remains,`
` ...and Genji watched over her, silent as always...`
`"Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa‐san?!`
` What in the world is going on?!"`
`"Aaah, Shannon!`
` Thank goodness you're safe...!`
` If something had happened to you, I...!"`
`"......George‐sama......`
` ......uuuuughh........."`
`"George‐kun, be quiet for a second!`
` A murder occurred before your very eyes, right?!`
` Did you see the culprit?!`
` Or not?!!"`
`"Tha‐......that is, umm,`
` ......how should I explain...?!`
` G‐Genji‐san."`
`"..................Even we cannot explain what we saw very well."`
`"It certainly, umm, ...happened right before our eyes!`
` It was right in front of my eyes!`
` But still,`
` ......that, umm,`
` .........what was that...`
` Even I do not understand!"`
`"What are you saying?!`
` It's impossible for you to have met anyone other than the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, whose location has been unknown since last night,`
` or Kanon‐kun, who has gone missing!`
` Was it a man or a woman?!`
` You should be able to tell me at least that much, right?!"`
`"Auntie Rosa, calm down a bit...!`
` Anyone would be confused if two people were taken out right in front of them!`
` Gohda‐san, Genji‐san.`
` There's no need to rush.`
` Tell us what happened, one thing at a time."`
`"...............About that... ...How should I say it......"`
`".............................."`
`Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa‐san had been killed.`
`{n}We understood that much.`
`...And it seemed that it had occurred in front of their eyes.`
`{n}But even so, they spoke awkwardly.`
`They admitted that they had definitely seen the crime with their own two eyes.`
`{n}But when asked to explain what they had seen, their mouths went suddenly shut.`
`I could understand why Auntie Rosa was irritated and losing her patience...`
`"...Shannon.`
` Did you see it?`
` When Doctor Nanjo was attacked."`
`"Ye‐.........yes."`
`"Tell me.`
` ...Just what you understand.`
` What in the world happened?"`
`"..................The back door............`
` ......In through there."`
`"...Tha‐that's right.`
` Someone came up to the back door.`
` Then, wondering who it was, I opened the door..."`
`"Someone at the back door?`
` Who was it?!"`
`"Let them finish!`
` And after that?!"`
`".........That person was...stained with blood, and had a large wound.`
` ...We carried them to the servant room, and Doctor Nanjo immediately began first aid.`
` ......It was a...very deep wound."`
`"For the last time, {i:who} are you talking about?!"`
`"...I don't know!`
` Certainly, ...in the beginning, I thought I knew.`
` No, I still think it was!`
`But.........what in the world was that!!`
` ...I don't know... ...I don't know!!"`
`In a manner that didn't match his large body, Gohda held his head and scratched at it...`
`I didn't have a clue whether he was confused because he couldn't remember,`
` or whether he was confused because he had seen something terrifying, and couldn't accept it.`
`And Shannon looked the same way.`
`If she let her guard down, what she had seen just a short while ago would quickly melt away like a daydream,`
` and she wouldn't even be able to remember what she saw.`
`......That's what she looked like.`
`Only Genji looked composed as usual.`
`...So the questions were naturally directed at Genji.`
`But even Genji had to take quite some time to gather his thoughts before he opened his mouth.`
`"Genji‐san.`
` You saw it, right?`
` Who was the person that came in through the back door?!"`
`"............At first, ...we believed that person...was Kanon."`
`"You see!!`
` He was alive after all!`
` My reasoning was correct!!"`
`"......By "at first", you mean that your impression changed later, right......?"`
`"Yes.`
` .........I cannot explain with words what happened after that.`
` ......It killed Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa, ......then disappeared.`
` At that time, it was definitely not Kanon."`
`"Yes!`
` That's right!`
` It's just as Genji‐san says!!`
` You really couldn't explain it with words!"`
`"......Do you have the same opinion?"`
`"...Yes............`
` I......can only say the same thing as well......"`
`"..........................."`
`...If we interpreted what they were saying favorably,`
` ......it meant that Auntie Rosa's conclusion had been correct from the beginning.`
`Kanon‐kun had appeared from the back door in the kitchen with a serious injury.`
`{n}Then he had been taken to the servant room and cared for.`
`......Then, something terrifying had happened.`
`Since these people couldn't imagine that Kanon‐kun could have pulled that off, they had started to suspect whether that really had been Kanon‐kun.`
` Is that how things are?`
`In other words, this meant......Kanon‐kun had appeared.`
`{n}No matter how confused they were, no matter how they muddled their words, that's what it meant in the end.`
`So had Kanon‐kun indeed used some trick to escape that room while it was locked?!`
` No, that doesn't matter anymore.`
`The real problem is that Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa‐san were killed.`
`Auntie Rosa had claimed that Kanon‐kun was behind this from the very beginning.`
`No matter how confused they became and no matter how much they tried to deny it, ...they were halfway saying that it was the truth.`
`......But even so, for some reason, I felt like their awkwardness couldn't be explained just by confusion...`
`......What had they seen?`
`Like they said, had they really {i:seen something unexplainable with words}...?`
`Auntie Rosa, having decided that she wouldn't be able to get any more out of them, concluded her questioning,`
` and said that she wanted to check the two bodies.`
`I was also interested in that.`
`Even if these people didn't have a clue what was going on in their confusion,`
` ...if those of us who hadn't been at the scene calmly looked at the bodies, we might find something.`
`.........But it was a little surprising that Auntie Rosa was also concerned about the bodies, just like I was.`
`Even at this point, I still wanted to expose the culprit and the truth myself, if we could find any clues.`
`But Auntie Rosa should have been different.`
` ......Hadn't Auntie Rosa's plan given a higher priority to staying safe than to finding the culprit?`
`I couldn't really see why Auntie Rosa wanted to check the bodies so badly that she would deliberately leave our fort in the parlor.`
`"We will all go to the servant room together.`
` If we all move together, it'll be safe.`
` Maria, stop that scribbling now!"`
`"Uu.`
` Not scribbliiing.`
` Solving {f:5:Beatrice}'s probleeem.`
` Uu..."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}'s problem?`
` What's that? Tell me too."`
`"...Auntie Rosa, are you...umm...bringing Maria‐chan too?"`
`It seemed that George‐aniki had some resistance to bringing Maria to the bloody crime scene.`
`...But taking into consideration the fact that Maria would be left alone here, it would surely be much safer if we took Maria with us.`
`......In the end, it was just Aniki's irresponsible humanism.`
`{n}We decided that all of us, including Maria, would go to the servant room.`
`The bed in the servant room was stained with bright‐red blood.`
`...No, not just the bed.`
` The whole room was covered with a gruesome paint from countless blood stains.`
`That dreadful scene alone was enough to give us an idea of the repulsive sight they had been trying to describe...`
`"......Uu.`
` Wanna look too!"`
`"You wait here with me, Maria‐chan, okay?"`
`George‐aniki was standing by the entrance, covering Maria's eyes, with his back to the room.`
`......He probably didn't want to dirty an innocent girl's retinas with the repulsive red in this room.`
`That was surely the correct decision.`
`......I was acting tough right now, so I didn't mind,`
` ......but I would probably remember this room and start to vomit whenever I saw red paint scattered around,`
` for the rest of my life.`
`......My retinas already had this room burned into them.`
`{n}...In other words, it was too late for me...`
`"...............Huh......"`
`"Wh‐...where did they...!"`
`Right after they entered the servant room, Gohda‐san and Shannon‐chan appeared flustered.`
`...We shook, wondering what horrible new situation had arisen to fluster them for a second time.`
`"What happened?`
` What is it?"`
`Auntie Rosa also shuddered, raised her gun high, and searched for whatever it was that had them shaken.`
`......But she couldn't find it.`
` ...Which wasn't surprising.`
`{n}...They were shaken {i:because} they couldn't find it.`
`"Hey, hey, what in the world's going on..."`
`".........The two bodies...aren't here."`
`"What do you mean?"`
`"......Tha‐that can't be...!`
` Those two were definitely...here......!"`
`"...Wait wait wait.`
` What the hell—are you saying the corpses just walked off somewhere?`
` How could that happen?`
` I mean, wasn't the servant room locked?`
` Didn't you unlock the door when you came in just now, Gohda‐san?!"`
`"......So then, what?`
` ...Isn't this the same as Jessica's room?!`
` They've disappeared from inside a locked room again?!`
` That's ridiculous!!"`
`"I don't have a clue what happened either!!`
` When we left this room, we definitely locked it, and......!!`
` I don't have a clue what's going on anymore...!!"`
`There was a timid and pitiful smile on Gohda‐san's face that he definitely wouldn't have let show normally.`
`Shannon was the same.`
`"Both their corpses disappeared!`
` And furthermore, they disappeared while the door was locked!`
` Even if the culprit was Kanon‐kun, he shouldn't be holding a master key anymore!!"`
`"That's wrong...!`
` Kanon‐kun is not the culprit...!!"`
`"......Shannon...`
` I believe Shannon.`
` Kanon‐kun is not the culprit.`
` This must be the doing of someone who looks a lot like him."`
`"No.`
` Kanon‐kun could have gotten a master key.`
` ......After all, his master key was found in the pocket of Jessica‐chan's body.`
` ...And who took that key?"`
`"!!`
` Th‐that's right!`
` It was Doctor Nanjo......!!"`
`That's right.`
` Back then, it definitely had been Doctor Nanjo who searched through Jessica's clothes and found the master key...!`
`So, if someone had the opportunity to search Doctor Nanjo's corpse, it would have been easy for them to take the master key back...`
`Auntie Rosa searched under the bed and in the locker.`
`...By now, I also understood what that meant.`
`{n}If you assume that there had been two culprits, it could be easily explained.`
`The first person was Kanon‐kun, or maybe an impostor that looked like him.`
`{n}He had finished off Doctor Nanjo and ran off somewhere.`
`The second person was......probably the 19th person, {f:5:Beatrice}, whose location was unknown.`
`She had hidden under the bed in the servant room beforehand, and with Doctor Nanjo's body still enshrined here, she had waited for Genji‐san and the rest to leave.`
`Then after that, she had crawled out, taken the master key back from Doctor Nanjo's pocket, and carried the two bodies away for some reason.`
`If she had then locked the door with the master key, this locked room would be created.`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` You constructed that one pretty fast with your reasoning from Jessica's room as a premise.`
` With that method, you could indeed create a locked room even without magic.`
` Should I give you passing marks?`
` However, as truly fascinating as it was, ......there is something you must not forget."`
`"...If the culprit had taken the master key back by the method you say,`
` ......that culprit...`
`{i:would have to have known that Nanjo had taken the master key from Jessica's body}."`
`"......You don't have to tell me that...`
` You're probably trying to say that it's information only the people in that place, at that time, could know..."`
`"......Heh!`
` This third locked room was crushed so fast that you can't do anything but gripe.`
` There's no art in repeating the same content..."`
`Even though I was acting tough, that move of the witch's hurt bad...`
`{n}......I could feel cracks forming in the thing I most wanted to deny.`
`She's trying to close in on me from two directions.`
`On the one hand, there's the frontal attack, where she tries to force me to believe in witches, using locked room tricks that only a witch could do.`
`......And on the other hand, there's the rear attack, where she tries to lure me into thinking it would be better if there was a witch, by strengthening my suspicions of those close to me.`
`In the first locked room, the chapel, she had used the frontal attack, but it hadn't worked on me.`
`That's undoubtedly why, with the second locked room, and now the third, she's started to change the direction of her attack...`
`However, the fact that she was changing the direction of her attack also proved that my resistance was working a little.`
`...And she had surely given up on the frontal attack because she couldn't just win directly with it...`
`.........I tried to force myself to accept my own position by thinking that.`
`{n}But it seemed that the witch had seen through these thoughts of mine long ago.`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` The frontal attack is indispensable.`
` ...The rear attack only has meaning because it advances at the same time as the frontal attack.`
` If I were to degenerate into only using the rear attack, it would be nothing more than a foolish plan occurring when my means became my goal."`
`"...Ihihi, really?`
` Well then, won't you repeat "no one was hiding in the servant room" in that red you're so proud of?"`
`"There is no need.`
` The premise of your reasoning is about to be destroyed."`
`"Oh, oh?!`
` You decline?!`
` So someone really is hiding?!"`
`"Rosa will destroy your premise right now.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*!`
` Well, try listening in."`
`"Please believe us, Rosa‐sama...!!`
` The two bodies were certainly lying here!`
` The bright‐red blood on the floor is theirs...!!"`
`Auntie Rosa began to search through various objects around the room, her back to Gohda‐san as he cried out in supplication.`
`......Eventually, she found something, and for a while, stopped moving.`
`"Rosa‐sama, we definitely aren't lying...!!`
` The two bodies were definitely here!!"`
`"Quiet down.`
` .........The person who hid the corpses has confessed that they took them to another place.`
` .........With this."`
`Rosa showed them a single sheet of paper over her shoulder.`
`"What on Earth is that?!`
` It couldn't be......a letter in a sealed envelope with crest, just like in the chapel?!"`
`"......Yes, that's right.`
` It was set here, out in the open.`
` I'll read it."`
`{e:070:―People of the Ushiromiya family.`
`I wonder if your attempts at solving the epitaph's riddle for the gold are reaching a climax.`
`Solving the riddle of the epitaph is the single method by which you all can stop me.}`
`{e:070:You will not be able to stop me, or the ritual, by way of any other method of any kind.`
`I ask all of you that you take care not to mistake your goal.}`
`{e:070:Attempting to search for me is useless.`
`Attempting to escape from me is useless.`
`Attempting to deny me is also—useless.`
`—{f:5:Beatrice} the Golden.}`
`"......P.S.`
` I borrowed the two bodies for the ritual.`
` I will return them later, so please accept my apologies.`
` ...Furthermore, since these keys belong to all of you, I shall return them."`
`As Rosa read that aloud, the contents of the envelope lay exposed on the palm of her hand.`
`They were two master keys.`
`{n}The master key that Nanjo had found in Jessica's pocket, which had originally been Kanon's, and Kumasawa's master key.`
`"What the helllllll......`
` So what does that mean...`
` Damn you, again?!`
` You're saying I can only suspect the servants holding keys again?!"`
`"I haven't said it in red, you know...?`
` I haven't denied the possibility that at the time they locked the door and left, someone was hiding in this room...`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"......If they were hiding under the bed, it wouldn't have been impossible for them to have carried the corpses away somewhere.`
` But that way they couldn't lock the door!`
` The master key they went to all that trouble to get their hands on was set down right here!"`
`"......That's right, I'd forgotten.`
` What about the keys specifically for this room, the servant room keys?!"`
`"Mmhm.`
` Those {p:1:are in the key box in the center of the servant room}.`
` There are several servant room keys, but {p:1:all of those are inside the key box}."`
`"Which means that the situation isn't any different from the time with the key to Jessica's room...`
` It's not like the servants would walk around with an unnecessary key when they have those convenient master keys.`
` I can accept that they were all still shut away in the key box..."`
`"And nothing has changed in the other conditions.`
` {p:1:Entry and exit are impossible except for the single door and the single window}.`
` Therefore, hidden doors and irregular methods of entry cannot exist.`
` Rejoice, great detectives.`
` *cackle*!"`
`"`
`{p:1:And those were both locked}.`
` {p:1:The door and the window do not permit any kind of entry or exit when they are locked}.`
` So it won't work to remove the door, make a crack to slide in through, or anything like that while the lock is maintained.`
` And obviously, {p:1:it is impossible to unlock the door without the servant room key or a master key}."`
`"...It's a pain having to read all these aloud every time.`
` Sooner or later, I should think of some word to abbreviate all this into a single phrase."`
`"But you can't repeat that no one was hiding in this room!`
` ......However, that alone won't break open the door of a locked room...`
` Aaah, damn it, damn it!!`
` It's no good, no good, no goddamn good at all...!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` What happened to that flipping over the chessboard thing that you're so proud of...?`
` Please, announce your boastful strange theory."`
`"...............Flip over...the chessboard.`
` ............What would I do if I were the culprit?`
` I carry the corpses off somewhere.`
` ......I leave a letter.`
` .........I lock the door from the inside.`
` ......Then I just have to escape this room by some means."`
`".........Damn it, is that even possible?!`
` I was told in red that you can't get outside except by the door or the window...!"`
`"..................ah—"`
`......At that moment, ......I got it.`
` That's right.`
`......Carry the corpses, leave the letter.`
`{n}......And not rely on a "hidden door"—{i:in other words, not even able to escape}.`
`...That's it.`
` This isn't a question, it's an answer......`
`"Beato.`
` ......Before my repetition request, I want to check the {i:definition of these hidden doors} that you're talking about."`
`"What have you thought of?`
` Very well, I'll explain.`
` A hidden door refers to an entrance or exit that cannot be recognized by those who do not know of it.`
` Even children know that."`
`"......So in other words, if you can't get outside the room with it, it isn't a hidden door?"`
`"Hoh.`
` .........That angle."`
`"I kept thinking that the culprit had escaped the locked room."`
`"......That's wrong.`
` Even the culprit couldn't escape the locked room!`
` So the culprit decided to hide until we passed by!"`
` I had used this theory for the second locked room, and reasoned that Kanon‐kun might have done this.`
`......But I had given up that reasoning when I was told "Kanon‐kun was killed" in red.`
`And next, I had reasoned that if there had been a third person in the room, it would have been possible for them to escape through a hidden door.`
`And that was when, for the first time, the claim had been made in red that "no hidden doors exist".`
`And what I'd learned just now.`
` These "hidden doors" the witch was talking about referred to things that made it possible to get into or out of the room.`
`......In other words, things that didn't permit entry or exit to the outside, and also wouldn't be noticed by people who didn't know about them, wouldn't fall under the definition of "hidden door".`
`In other words, if there were, for example, something like a "hidden shelf" or a "secret closet", they wouldn't be defined as "hidden doors"!`
`In other words, the third person in Jessica's room was hiding here, waiting for us to pass by!`
`Heh, how pathetic, just a little playing around with words!`
`{n}With this method, it looks like I can even manage the third locked room, the servant room.`
`If there's a hidden shelf under the bed or anything like that, that would be enough.`
`{n}The culprit's hiding somewhere, waiting for us to leave.`
`.........The culprit is also trapped in the locked room even now!!`
`Which means......at this very moment!`
`The culprit is still hiding in the servant room, holding their breath...!!!`
`And that means......... What the hell...`
`Even though we've been tortured with locked rooms three times,`
` ......in this very moment, we've actually gotten the culprit in checkmate!!`
`"I've finally started to see it.`
` ......Take this, Beato!!"`
`"Repetition requested!`
` "There is no one in this room other than us"!`
` By us, I mean me, George‐aniki, Maria, Auntie Rosa, Genji‐san, Gohda‐san, and Shannon‐chan, alright?!`
` Well?!! You can't say it, can you?!"`
`".........Hoh......`
` .........Hoh......!"`
`"I'll bet I hit you where it hurts!!`
` If you decline, then say you decline, damn it!!`
` Here comes the next one!!`
` Repetition requested!!"`
`I don't know how they're hiding in this room.`
`But if that's a fact, then this also resolves the second locked room, Jessica's room, at the same time!!`
`I've finally caught her by the tail!`
`{n}With this, I can explain everything!`
`{n}Witches don't exist, I don't have to doubt anyone!!`
`Alright, starting now, I'll flip it over!`
` The next thing I'll request she repeat is—`
`"`
`{p:1:No one exists in this room except your group}.`
` {p:1:"Your group" refers to Battler, George, Maria, Rosa, Genji, Gohda, and Shannon}."`
`"......Wha‐............"`
`"Let's go back to Jessica's room.`
` {p:1:At the time of Jessica's corpse discovery,`
` only Battler, George, Maria, Rosa, Genji, Gohda, Shannon, Kumasawa, and Nanjo were in Jessica's room}."`
`"Whoops, the corpse of {p:1:Jessica is also included, of course}.`
` {p:1:Therefore, both in the case of Jessica's room and the case of this servant room, no humans exist that you were not aware of}.`
` {p:1:No one is hiding}."`
`"And I'll say more.`
` {p:1:No method exists by which the doors can be locked from the outside without using a key}.`
` {p:1:Regarding the windows, no method exists by which they could somehow be locked from the outside}."`
`"And while I'm at it.`
` {p:1:You are incompetent}!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, {p:1:hiiihhi{0}hi{0}hhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi}!!"`
`"S‐.........son of a biiiiitch......`
` Then.........it really is......a locked room, isn't it............"`
`"It, ...it was so hard to think of, too.`
` If you had been hiding...that explanation would fit everything.`
` Just when I thought I'd broken the trick... .........Damn iiit..."`
`".........u............uoooooooooooooooooooooohhh!!"`
`It's no good no good no good no goddamn good!!`
`{n}For a second, I thought I had it!`
` It was no goddamn good at all!!`
`{f:5:Beatrice}, you bitch,`
` I thought you were all smoke and mirrors, playing word games that made clever use of red,`
` I was certain you'd just cleverly deceived me...!!`
`......Just when I thought I'd seen a light in the darkness,`
` ............it disappeared,`
` .........it just disappeared.........`
`swallowed up...`
`...by a blood‐red sea.........!`
`Red,`
` ...`
`...`
`red`
` red`
` red`
` red!!`
`No one is hiding!`
` And there's no hidden door, and no way to trick the doors or the windows while they're locked!!`
`Have you just proven that it's all impossible?!`
`Has the Devil's Proof...`
`...been pulled off...`
`...with a frontal attack?!`
`Impossible,`
` ......this is impossible!!`
`"What's wrong, Ushiromiya Battlerr?`
` Weren't you so confident you could deny witchesss?`
` Why are you groveling and wringing out bitter tears in a place like thaaat?"`
`"Oh, yes, that's a really wonderful method.`
` Truly wonderful how you're trying to make me fall over laughing and drown in a sea of the tears of my own laughter.`
` That's what you're really trying to do, riight?`
` You're trying to make me laugh and laugh and laugh myself to death, riight,`
` U`
`shiro`
`miya`
` Batt`
`le`
`e`
`rr`
`???"`
`"Magic?! Screw that! I'll definitely deny witches exist!!`
` I'll never believe in you!!`
` You used the power of magic,`
` ......and bullied and killed everyone for fun?`
` ......I'm never gonna accept thaaaaaaaat!!"`
`"Hey, Battler?`
` Sorry for bullying you too much.`
` I'll "flip over the chessboard" from my side.`
` I'll teach your side the best move in your place.`
` Want to heeeeeaar??"`
`"Screw you, I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna hear!!"`
`"The case of Jessica's room.`
` You really struck on a good spot, you know...?`
` Trying to hide and wait for you to pass by.`
` That truly was a good observation."`
`"...But why did you think that could only be Kanon or me, the 19th person......?`
` I see, the "hide" part of "hide and wait for you to pass" must have gotten in the way, so you didn't think that far."`
`"...Loooook, now do you understand?`
` It's Jessica.`
` Jeeeessicaaaaaa!!"`
`If Jessica were the culprit, ......a farce like this could be easily constructed!!`
`She killed Kanon‐kun, and carried him off somewhere!`
`{n}Then, she played dead and let us walk by!`
`But that's ridiculous!!`
` Doctor Nanjo had definitely checked that she was dead!`
` So is Doctor Nanjo an accomplice too?!`
`That's wrong!!`
` I had also made sure that Jessica was really dead!`
` Sure, I'd never performed an examination of a corpse before, but she was definitely dead!`
`I think she was dead!!`
` No, she probably, surely, definitely, at least I think so but she has to be, no, no......`
` ...She was dead!!`
` She was dead!!!`
`"Jessica was also an accomplice.`
` And Nanjo, who examined her corpse, was also an accomplice.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` Then the third locked room was a faaaarce."`
`Yeah, then it's simple.`
` Doctor Nanjo was an accomplice so in other words, he was on the culprits' side so in other words in other words...`
`he was never killed in the first place?!`
`We thought he had been killed and the body had disappeared, but he wasn't in the servant room in the first place?!`
`Then is Kumasawa baa‐chan, who disappeared with him, also an accomplice?!`
`......That's not all that's not all!`
`{n}The servants who are going along with that story—Genji‐san and Gohda‐san, and even Shannon‐chan are accomplices!`
`Then, the one who stole the key from Maria's handbag was Jessica,`
` ...no no, it's also possible it was George‐aniki!`
`After all, if Shannon‐chan was on the culprit's side, then George‐aniki would automatically be on the culprit's side as well!!`
`Wait a second just wait a second, they're all wolves...`
`{n}They're all wolves!!`
`Not only am I drowning in an ocean of bright‐red blood,`
` there are packs of wolves clamoring on the banks, whose blazing eyes tell me that if I crawl out, they'll eat me!!`
`Which way should I die?!`
`{n}Will I have everything denied, and drown in a bright‐red sea?!`
`{n}Will I know the truth, and have my whole body chewed to bits by the wolves?!`
`It's either one hell or the other!!`
` I can't choose!`
`{n}Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!`
`"That is why I am here...!!`
` {p:1:Come on, Ushiromiya Battler, kneel}.`
` Then swear your eternal loyalty and lick my shoes...!!"`
`"{p:1:If you accept me, all of the riddles will be resolved}.`
` {p:1:With my power, any kind of locked room can be created or destroyed}!!"`
`"Battler, don't you want to abandon yourself to the joy of surrendering to one with poweeeer??`
` {p:1:I'll make you my favorite piece of furniture}.`
` {p:1:I'll love you so much and make you my toy until you turn to ashes}..."`
`"{p:1:*cackle*cackle*cackle*hihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hha{0}hha{0}hha{0}hha{0}hha{0}hhahha}!!!"`
`".........Now it's clear.`
` There's no longer any reason to doubt."`
`"Hm...?`
` ......What do you mean by that......?"`
`"Those two that you kept saying were dead aren't here.`
` ...And now we have the letter from {f:5:Beatrice}, where she was kind enough to confess that she carried the corpses off.`
` ......That's what it is."`
`"I've had enough of this farce!!"`
`As Auntie Rosa yelled this, she looked over at everyone with a harsh expression.`
`"Fa‐`
`......farce?`
` ......What do you mean...?!"`
`"I said it in Jessica‐chan's room.`
` ......You can't trust anyone but yourself and those whose corpses have been found."`
`"And since we cannot find the corpses, there's no reason we should accept that those two were killed."`
`"......P‐please wait, Auntie Rosa.`
` What do you mean by that...?!"`
`"Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa‐san aren't dead, they're alive!`
` They made it seem like they were killed, and are hiding somewhere in this mansion.`
` So that they can attack us!!"`
`"How could you know that?!`
` Are you saying that Gohda‐san and the rest are lying?!"`
`"......Rosa‐sama!!`
` I swear—no, all of the Ushiromiya family servants do!`
` We all swear that we would do nothing of the sort!!"`
`"You all say that those two were killed.`
` But since there are no corpses, there's no reason to believe that.`
` There's a chance that you worked out a story beforehand, and that you're lying about that!!"`
`"There's a good way to prove your innocence, isn't there?`
` For Doctor Nanjo's and Kumasawa‐san's bodies to be found!!"`
`"If we find them, then maybe I'll start listening to your story.`
` But until we do, you cannot deny that you are all wolves!!"`
`"You too!`
` And you!!`
` You were probably bought by that witch, your eyes blinded with gold!!`
` Do you really want money that much?!`
` That's right, isn't it?!`
` You want to play around for the rest of your life?!`
` What is that kind of life worth?!!"`
`"Rosa‐sama...!!`
` We...... We couldn't!"`
`"Silence!`
` And Shannon, don't get any closer!!`
` I can't believe that you would repay a ten‐year‐long debt of gratitude with betrayal!!`
` I'll pull the trigger without mercy!!"`
`"How......`
` .........How could you...`
` .........It's too......`
`cruel......"`
`"......A‐Auntie Rosa!!`
` That's horrible!!`
` A murder occurred in this room!`
` Then the culprit carried the corpses away!`
` They are only honestly reporting that to us!!"`
`".........uuu, ......uuuUUuuUUuughhu!!!"`
`Shannon had finally broken down in tears...`
`She had sacrificed ten years to the Ushiromiya family.`
`{n}She had sacrificed ten of the most brilliant years of her life.`
`.........And she had believed that she had built up a friendly relationship with Rosa, as well.`
`...And this was how she was treated!!`
`{n}You could kill a person without using a knife...`
`It wasn't just George‐aniki;`
` ...even I could recognize that Shannon‐chan had been stabbed deep into her heart, as blood by the name of tears flowed out...`
`"Shannon‐san, stay back...`
` ......Rosa‐sama, it is true that I have not served for many years, and I understand that I have not earned your trust..."`
`"...However, ......could you not at least believe Shannon‐san...?!`
` She has dedicated a full ten years of service to the Ushiromiya family...!"`
`"I'm not telling you to believe me...!`
` At the very least, would you at least believe Shannon‐san...?!!"`
`...But......I don't understand anymore!!`
`{n}I don't understand!!`
`We can't seek an answer without suspecting them!!!`
`That's it, bit by bit I'm starting to understand...`
`......It's because we seek an answer; ...that's why everything keeps getting stranger...`
`We don't need...an answer.`
` These are all strange murders committed with bizarre magic by the 19th person, the witch {f:5:Beatrice}, as she follows a creepy ritual.`
`............Isn't that......good enough.........`
`I don't...want to suspect...anyone anymore.........`
`Shannon‐chan and Gohda‐san were protesting their innocence, half in tears.`
`Genji‐san quietly stopped that.`
`"............Stop.`
` ...What Rosa‐sama says is quite right.`
` ...Until we find the corpses,`
` {i:we cannot prove that Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa are innocent}."`
`That's right.`
` ......By Rosa‐san's argument, if the corpses could be found, then the innocence of at least those people could be proved.`
`But only the people who were corpses.`
` Even if they searched around the mansion and found the corpses, in the end, their own innocence would not be proved.`
`They had abducted Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa‐san, killed them in another place, and locked the room with their own master keys.`
`Unless the locked room could be broken by a method other than that one,`
` ......it would be impossible to prove their innocence...`
`......But, .........that couldn't be done!!`
`They only have one chance to prove their innocence.`
`......That can only happen when they meet with the culprit, become corpses, and are reunited with Auntie Rosa.`
`That's messed up!!`
` Innocent if they die, guilty as long as they live, almost like a witch's trial!`
`...Oh, right, the enemy's a witch.`
`{n}So that makes it OK...?`
`"......Rosa‐sama.`
` We are furniture working for the Ushiromiya family.`
` ......Whether we are trusted by you or not, that is not our concern.`
` No matter what assessment you give us, we will only continue to serve until our final hour."`
`"You really are a model servant.`
` ...I truly understand why Father trusts you.`
` It is truly heartrending that I must suspect even you."`
`"........................"`
`Genji‐san stuck his hand into his pocket and pulled out a master key.`
`...Then he set it on an adjacent table.`
`"......I believe that I hold this as a proof of trust.`
` If that has been lost, I think it is only natural that I return it."`
`"..................`
` ......That's good judgment.`
` Those master keys are the greatest basis upon which you have been suspected several times today.`
` Relinquishing them in order to clear away that suspicion may only be a first step,`
` but, well, I think it isn't a bad start."`
`"...............You two."`
`Genji‐san looked at Gohda‐san and Shannon‐chan.`
`......The two of them nodded, and set their own master keys onto the table.`
`Auntie Rosa lay the two master keys that had come out of the envelope on top.`
`With that, all five master keys were gathered in this place.`
`In other words, this was proof that all of the servants' service until today had been negated,`
` and even the final honor that they should have been permitted had been stripped from them...`
`"Maria, give me that handbag."`
`"......Uu!!`
` Give it baaack!!"`
`Auntie Rosa snatched Maria's handbag, tossed all the master keys in there noisily, then lifted one out and held it up for all to see.`
`She was announcing that she had all of the master keys.`
`"A‐.........are you satisfied now, Aunt Rosa?`
` ......Now the only master keys are the ones you are holding yourself.`
` ......I hope you're satisfied!!"`
`"Yes, I'm satisfied.`
` Even if I can't trust anyone, I can at least trust myself!"`
`"I've been able to get the gun and all the master keys for myself!`
` Now, I don't have to suspect anyone.`
` You're all happy too, right?`
` Now you don't have to be suspected anymore!`
` Ahahahahahahahahaha, hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!"`
`".........Kihihihihi."`
`Then, Maria, who had looked like a spectator off by herself, sneered at her mother.`
`...Auntie Rosa reacted nervously to that laugh, and turned around.`
`"......Keys don't matter.`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice} can open doors with magic.`
` She doesn't need keys.`
` ...It doesn't matter who has or doesn't have something like that.`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi...!"`
`"Aren't I always telling you to stop laughing like that?!!`
` ......?`
` What is iiiit, Battler‐kun?"`
`...I had just cut between the two of them.`
`......No, that's not it.`
`...I was on my knees, and hugging Maria's head.`
`{n}......I was......crying.`
`"Just...stop it already, Auntie Rosa......`
` ...Maria was...right......"`
`"......Wha‐...what are you talking about......?"`
`".........Maria...`
` I'm sorry for...`
`......doubting.`
` ......I'm sorry for...`
`......not believing."`
`"...............Battler."`
`"It was all...`
`...the witch's doing...`
` ......The witch's...`
`...doing......`
` ...All that stuff about tricks and locked rooms never mattered..."`
`".........It's just, it's just...`
`.........that the witch {f:5:Beatrice} actually exists,`
` .........and she really was a witch...`
` ......Because I didn't believe that,`
` ............it was this painful,`
` ............this sad............"`
`".........Battler, ......you believe in {f:5:Beatrice}......?"`
`"Yes...!`
` I believe.`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice} "exists".`
` And she's a witch, who uses strange magic...!"`
`"Battler......"`
`Maria let go of my hand, ...and then she was the one holding my head.`
`"......That's the way, Battler.`
` ............{f:5:Beatrice} "existed".`
` ......You just couldn't believe that easily, so couldn't see her.`
` ............The witch "exists".`
` "Exists".`
` Will soon "come"."`
`".........You believed in Beato, so I'm sure you'll be invited to the Golden Land.`
` ......Very soon.`
` ......It'll be very soon.`
` Nothing to be afraid of anymore."`
`"............Not afraid, okay?`
` Always be with me, holding hands, okay...?`
` Let's solve the epitaph's riddle together.`
` Let's think about Beato's problem.`
` .........Beato has been saying it from the beginning.`
` She hasn't said anything other than let's play and solve the problem."`
`"Right...... She did......`
` Searching for the culprit was just a total waste of time...`
` ......If only we had...`
`...just believed in...`
`...the witch........."`
`After softly brushing my cheek as my tears kept dripping down,`
` ......Maria kissed my forehead, as soft as a feather.`
`For just that instant, ......Maria's smile, which I had once thought was creepy, looked like an angel...`
`"We have returned the master keys, ...but our loyalty to the Ushiromiya family will not change.`
` .........From now on, we will not enter the parlor without permission.`
` Rosa‐sama, please lock the parlor from the inside."`
`"......You truly are an admirable person.`
` When the typhoon passes, ......if the cries of the seagulls return to this island again,`
` .........I wonder if we will be able to trust each other once more."`
`"......If you were to grant us your trust once again, there would be no greater pleasure."`
`"You're right.`
` ......We'll definitely be able to understand each other.`
` ......When the seagulls cry."`
`".........It would probably be better if we left this room as it is until the police come.`
` Rosa‐sama, if you would please lock it.`
` ......We will return to the kitchen.`
` If you need anything, please command us at any time."`
`"Thank you.`
` ............If you are a wolf,`
` how shamelessly you speak."`
`"......And if you are a sheep,`
` .........I'm sorry for throwing you into the wolf cage."`
`"......Furniture entrusts its fate to the family.`
` ......Even if it comes to throwing away this life, if by that your trust could be regained,`
` it would be a great honor."`
`".....................`
` I hope that you all can remain healthy until the typhoon passes, if that is at all possible.`
` This is all a rhapsody of blowing winds and pouring rain performed by the typhoon.`
` ......When the performance ends, and the curtain closes,`
` ......we will surely be able to grasp hands together again."`
`"......When the seagulls...cry."`
`Auntie Rosa nodded in response...`
`Genji‐san turned on his heels.`
`{n}He left the servant room.`
`Gohda‐san's face was still streaked with tears,`
` ......but as he had listened to Genji‐san's words, maybe he had managed to sort out his heart.`
`......His face had been truly shameful,`
` ......but it had returned to the face of the Gohda‐san we knew well.`
`".........I will also be waiting in the kitchen.`
` ......If you need anything, please command me at any time.`
` .........If you wish for some warm food, I promise to have the very best prepared for you."`
`"............Thank you.`
` I would like to ask you for breakfast tomorrow.`
` ......And the boat will probably come by midday tomorrow.`
` ...Thanks for everything up until now.`
` Your cooking was my only pleasure on Rokkenjima."`
`"...Certainly.`
` I promise you, I will prepare a supreme breakfast.`
` Please, look forward to tomorrow morning."`
`"Thank you.`
` ............And Shannon‐chan.`
` Tomorrow morning, ...let's make up while drinking some delicious coffee."`
`"............"`
`"......?`
` George‐kun?"`
`"......I'm...going with them too."`
`"...It's alright, George‐sama...`
` Please, return to the parlor.`
` There are no more master keys anymore.`
` So if you are with Rosa‐sama in the parlor, you won't be threatened by anyone."`
`"That's right.`
` ...That's how things are.`
` ...Objectively speaking, I think that being with me in the parlor would be the safest."`
`"......But I won't force you to stay with us.`
` George‐kun, you may stay in any place you feel is safe.`
` .........You are already an adult.`
` It's up to you where and with whom you spend the time until tomorrow morning."`
`".........Yes.`
` I will decide, by myself...`
`who I'll spend the night with."`
`"A‐.........Aniki......"`
`"Battler‐kun, stay with Auntie Rosa in the parlor.`
` I'm sure that's safest.`
` ......Compared to that, I think being outside the parlor isn't as safe.`
` ......So I can't leave her in a place like that alone."`
`"......It's......not like I suspect Shannon‐chan and the other servants—`
`no, anyone at all......`
` I don't want to suspect anyone..."`
`"The inheritance?`
` The gold?`
` ...That's just stupid...`
` ...There's no way people are killing each other over that......"`
`"Yes.`
` I know better than anyone how pure your heart is, Battler‐kun.`
` ......No one will blame you.`
` No one."`
`"..................Anikii..."`
`"...It's okay.`
` I'll protect you.`
` ......If you're with me, even {f:5:Beatrice} can't lay a hand on you.`
` 'Cause even though I'm small, I'm a witch."`
`"Yeah.`
` .........Maria‐chan.`
` I'm leaving Battler‐kun in your care.`
` .........Alright, Shannon.`
` Let's go."`
`"Yes......`
` ......Rosa‐sama, if you would excuse me.`
` If you have an order, please call me at any time."`
`".........I'm sorry for saying something so cruel just now.`
` ............I don't expect you to have forgiven me by tomorrow morning.`
` But when tomorrow morning comes, let me apologize again."`
`"Yes...`
` ............Thank you very much."`
`George‐aniki and Shannon‐chan left the servant room together.`
`.........Now, only Maria, Auntie Rosa and I were left in this disgusting, blood‐stained room.`
`Until Genji‐san disappeared—until Gohda‐san disappeared—until George‐aniki and Shannon‐chan disappeared—we stood there, in a daze...`
`After their presence and their footsteps had disappeared completely, Auntie Rosa giggled at them, as though she had just remembered something pleasant.`
`".........You can't trust them at all.`
` Goddamn furniture."`
`That one sentence...`
`...made me choke.`
`"...Wh‐`
`.........why are you...`
`.........saying...`
`something like that......?"`
`"There are five master keys in all?`
` Who would believe that?`
` It's obvious that some duplicate keys exist.`
` ......As if we could trust them just because they pulled keys out of their pockets...!!"`
`"Th‐......that's not fair.........`
` By, ......by setting down those keys, ......they weren't just letting go of the keys..."`
`"......You've...made all their hard work count for nothing, disgraced it, trampled it,`
` .........and caused them to give up the keys at the end of it all......"`
`"What's with that parting line...`
` They've shown that they're willing to go this far, ......and you still can't trust them?!`
` Too much... That's just too much......!"`
`"It's a Devil's Proof!`
` There are five master keys in all?!`
` It's impossible to prove something like that!!`
` You can show that there are five master keys by placing them here!`
` But you can't prove that no more than five exist!!`
` Only a demon or a witch could prove something like that, you know?!"`
`"Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!`
` Stop it already stop it already...!!"`
`"Please, {f:5:Beatrice}, show yourself right now,`
` and tell Auntie Rosa in red that "there are only five master keys"!!`
` Please, I beg you, this can only be proved by devils, a witch like you could prove it!"`
`"Please, Beato, show yourself here and tell Auntie Rosa...`
`that those are all of the master keys, and that there's no need to suspect anyone anymore...!!!"`
`"`
`{p:1:There are only five master keys}.`
` {p:1:There are only five master keys}."`
`"...*cackle*, whatever could be wrong?`
` It doesn't reach Rosa's ears no matter how often I say it.`
` It seems there must still be someone who denies that I exist, isn't that riiiight?`
` Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeer???"`
`"I accept it!!`
` I accept it, you exist you exist you definitely exist!`
` So, I beg you, stop this already!!`
` Stop it already! Stop it already!!`
` HiiiiIIIiiiiiIiiiiiiii!!"`
`"Your words alone will not reach me; show it with your actions.`
` Swear from your heart that you will become my furniture."`
`"Can you do it?`
` Take off your clothes, be naked, then put both your hands flat and crawl on the ground.`
` Clothing is proof of one's humanity.`
` From now on, you will become furniture, so you will lose that right, it's only natural!!"`
`"Then kneel, make your tongue crawl on my shoes.`
` Can you do it?`
` You can do it, riiiiiiiight??`
` Then I'll appear, sure, I'll say it in red, sure!`
` I'll tell Rosa that {p:1:there are only five master keys}!!"`
`"Oh, but I understand, there's no way you could throw away your lordly pride.`
` But that's alright, that's more than enough, you're starting to waver a bit, aren't youu?"`
`"For just an instant, you thought maybe it would be alright to lick my shoes, didn't youuu?`
` And you immediately denied that and felt ashamed, riiiiight??`
` Just looking at that expression makes me feel just wooonderful!!"`
`"That face of yours is so pathetic, go look in a mirror,`
` see how low you are there, naked and licking my shoooooes?`
` Can you see it, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer???"`
`"............Unbelievable.`
` ......Are you...saying that's the truth?"`
`"......Yes.`
` ......We described everything as we saw it."`
`George folded his arms and started humming again.`
`{n}...And the kitchen was once again absorbed by a long silence.`
`"George‐sama, I understand well why you aren't able to believe it so suddenly.`
` ...After all, ...even though I'm sure I saw it with my own eyes, I still don't know what it was I saw..."`
`"I'm sure I saw it.`
` And I'm sure I even got into a scuffle with it!`
` And yet, ......I almost feel like it was all an illusion..."`
`"...I see.`
` ......So that's why you couldn't go into the details in front of Auntie Rosa."`
`"......If you had actually told her what you just told me, then it would have created even bigger problems.`
` ...Yes, I now understand that Genji‐san handled it all in a remarkably composed fashion."`
`"...............If only I had the power to explain it."`
`George had not actually seen it, so even when pressed to believe, he just couldn't imagine it.`
`......It was only natural.`
` Because even the people who had actually seen it had ended up questioning themselves as to what it was...`
`"...Let me back up a bit.`
` ......Shannon, you said that when you thought Kanon‐kun was an impostor, you went to pick up some spider webs, right?`
` Why did you do that?"`
`"......That's right, I was thinking about that as well.`
` Why spider webs?"`
`"I heard it once from Kumasawa‐san.`
` ......A long time ago, evil spirits lived in Rokkenjima, and they, umm, feared spider webs.`
` And they say there's a legend that people treasured spider webs as wards against magic."`
`"......So I, umm, ......just went with it.`
` I, I think I was also a bit confused..."`
`"............Interesting story.`
` ...Kumasawa was very knowledgeable about those kinds of tales."`
`"Spiders are useful, after all.`
` ......Certainly, the existence of such a creed isn't strange at all."`
`"............I'm sure...`
`...that torii shrine was entrapping the power of those evil spirits.`
` ...And since the spirit mirror was broken, that power revived...`
` ......I have no doubt that it became the power to make {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama revive..."`
`"............If I,`
` ......while I was in that weak‐hearted state,`
` .........hadn't done such an outrageous thing.........`
` Uuuuughh...!!"`
`"...Shannon.`
` You don't have to worry about that anymore.`
` ......I don't blame you for that."`
`Since long ago, Shannon had often hinted at a certain occult aspect regarding how she had met George.`
`While he did lend an ear to her tales, George had always thought that this was typical of a girl, associating love with fate, chance, and miracles.`
`......George had thought that breaking the spirit mirror offered to the torii shrine was going a little too far,`
` but he had forgiven her, laughing it off as just a little prank she had done because she had seriously desired a relationship with him.`
`......Just breaking a mirror in some musty shrine wouldn't change the fate of our meeting.`
`And that would never cause any curse.`
`{n}I remembered cheering her up, saying it was only a musty mirror covered in dust.`
`"...After I started working on this island, many of my coworkers told me of the existence of a spirit called {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"In the beginning, I thought it was ridiculous,`
` but since it appeared indiscreet to comment on that,`
` ...outwardly, I conducted myself as if I also believed it.`
` ......But, it's astonishing, she really—"`
`"Existed.`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama was in this mansion all along.`
` ......But {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama had lost her powers, ...and could not appear before us.`
` She did "exist" all along.`
` ...It's just that we couldn't {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} her."`
`"............I'd like to hear Genji‐san's opinion."`
`".........I do not have any opinion.`
` .........All that I would like to say is......that when it happened......there were five of us here."`
`"......And I thought that Kanon had returned through the back door.`
` Then, we carried him to the servant room,`
` .........something happened, and Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa passed on."`
`"......That is all.`
` ......We have already explained everything we saw.`
` ...I understand that it would be very unreasonable to try to force you to believe it when you did not see it yourself."`
`"How could he believe it?`
` .........I thought that it was undoubtedly Kanon‐san."`
`"......But when that thing got up from the bed,`
` ...and, that's right,`
` started to grope about that wound in its chest like this,`
` ......I felt that it wasn't Kanon‐san, but some different being."`
`".........You probably can't understand, George‐sama.`
` ...The terror of that moment when a person you thought you knew well exposes that he is in fact someone else...`
` .........I can't explain.`
` ...I can't explain it at all..."`
`"I understand.`
` ......I can tell just how dreadful a thing must have happened to cause you such a shock."`
`"......Thank you very much,`
` ...George‐sama."`
`And they all went silent again.`
`No matter how many times she was consoled, Shannon kept on crying, weeping that listening to the witch's sweet whispers and breaking the spirit mirror on that day had been where this had all gone wrong...`
`"..................The witch that whispered to you...loses her powers if that mirror exists?"`
`"...I think she explained it to me a little, but I don't really remember.`
` ......I think she said something about how she couldn't release her power if that mirror existed."`
`"......What happened to this mirror that you broke?"`
`"I don't remember.`
` I suppose, ...since I left it broken, ...it would just have been lying there the way I left it."`
`"......So when, as they say, the reef was struck by lightning and disappeared, it would have gone to the bottom of the ocean...`
` Well, I'll bet picking it up and taping it together wouldn't have made it effective again anyway.`
` Hahahahaha."`
`".........Truly, .........what.........have I done........."`
`"......Sorry.`
` I shouldn't have said that."`
`He didn't know whether Shannon breaking the mirror had really been what had started everything off.`
`The servants didn't go so far as to blame Shannon, but it seemed that they believed that it had been the trigger.`
`...But even now, there was no way George could believe that much.`
`......Even if he was told a story about witches and evil spirits, it just sounded fake to him.`
`Even so, he listened seriously to Shannon's story, trying to find a hint that might relieve at least a little of the pain in her heart.`
`"Come to think of it, .........I think it is different from the one in that torii,`
` ...but I have heard that Madam keeps a spirit mirror as a charm."`
`"......Oh?`
` Aunt Natsuhi does?"`
`"Yes.`
` I believe she received it as one of the mementos of her grandfather or something, and that it held a very strong magic repelling power, a "historically rich"(?)`
` spirit mirror or something..."`
`"............I have also heard the same story.`
` ......Something about the mirror having the power to reflect that which is not good and send it back."`
`"If we had that spirit mirror, ......could we resist the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"Huh......"`
`When George proposed this, the servants looked up.`
`"......The shrine and the torii where it was enshrined are gone now, but the important thing is that there is still another spirit mirror."`
`".........I've heard that Aunt Natsuhi's family is descended from Shinto priests.`
` Maybe that isn't just a simple mirror."`
`"I, I believe I have heard Madam say that she keeps it safe in a treasure box.`
` ...It might not be very large."`
`".........I don't think its size is a problem.`
` Even the mirror I broke looked small and insignificant at a glance."`
`"............If our opponent is occult, then we too must resist by using occult measures.`
` ...If we just sit around here, nothing will be resolved.`
` It's worth trying, if only for some peace of mind."`
`Of course, this didn't mean that George had accepted the witch.`
`{n}......However, he thought it would be necessary to have some kind of purification ceremony to heal the wounds in Shannon's heart.`
`...So this story about Natsuhi's spirit mirror was just what the doctor ordered.`
`"Let's go.`
` ...I won't suggest going to finish off the witch or something so outrageous.`
` ...However, I think it would be nice if we had something that repels magic to protect us from the witch."`
`"......Maria‐chan told me about this earlier, but the door to Grandfather's room is supposed to be able to repel magic, right?`
` ......As expected of Grandfather.`
` He had sufficient defense against the occult as well.`
` .........Let's go.`
` To Aunt Natsuhi's room!"`
`"Bu‐but, I think Madam's room is locked...!`
` We returned the master keys to Rosa‐sama,`
` ...and even the servant room, which contains the key box, has been locked up..."`
`"......In that case, Aunt Natsuhi should have been walking around with that key.`
` ...Aunt Natsuhi's body should still be in the chapel.`
` It will be bad to disturb it ourselves before the police come, but we can fully explain that."`
`"However...the entrance to the chapel is also locked..."`
`"Hahaha, Gohda‐san, are you not strong enough to break a single glass window?`
` You could smash it with a rock from around there."`
`"W‐would it, ...umm, be okay to break the window of that important chapel...?"`
`"When Grandfather gets mad at us, I'll take responsibility.`
` ......From the beginning, I was planning on fighting with the whole Ushiromiya family today.`
` So that they would permit my engagement with you.`
` ...So I am already prepared."`
`"Let's break the glass.`
` Then, let's borrow the key from Aunt Natsuhi's body."`
`It seemed that George's claim that he would take responsibility had given the servants a great amount of courage.`
`...Shannon and Gohda glanced at each other, and then looked at George's face again.`
`"Grandfather knows everything about the occult.`
` I'm sure he'll understand if it's about the power of Aunt Natsuhi's spirit mirror.`
` Don't worry, he won't get mad at you."`
`".........I wonder if Madam's mirror...`
`...can really seal {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...`
`...once again."`
`"I don't know.`
` But I think it's worth trying.`
` ...So let's go.`
` It's getting darker and darker outside.`
` Let's hurry!"`
`"Shannon, get a flashlight!`
` Gohda‐san, find something that looks like it can break the glass!`
` Genji‐san, sorry, but could you get us some umbrellas?"`
`"""Yes!"""`
`The servants, who had been rejected by Rosa, started to move once again, having gained a new master.`
`{n}George, who was normally calm and gentle, was now exuding a commanding presence.`
`Shannon checked the emergency flashlight.`
`{n}Just in case, she changed the batteries.`
`Gohda was examining several heavy‐looking cooking tools.`
`{n}...Normally, a self‐respecting chef like himself wouldn't want to use them for anything other than their intended purpose.`
`But now he was frantic to fulfill the orders of the one he accepted as his master.`
`After some deliberation, he took a large, weighty frying pan.`
`Genji removed several umbrellas from the umbrella stand set in the corner near the back door of the kitchen.`
` ...He took three of them.`
`"Genji‐san...?"`
`".........I cannot go with you.`
` ......It would be embarrassing for me, as the head servant of the Ushiromiya family, if we were all absent when an order was to be given."`
`"Wh‐...what in the world, Genji‐san?!`
` Even you should understand how dangerous it would be to be alone in this mansion now...!"`
`"......I can't go.`
` ......I must stay here so the Master can call me at any time."`
`"Genji‐sama......"`
`"......Go, and serve George‐sama.`
` Don't make any blunders.`
` Gohda, I'm counting on you to be an example."`
`"Ye‐.........yes.`
` ...Leave it to me."`
`"I will surely fulfill my duty..."`
`"Is this really alright, ...Genji‐san?"`
`"Yes.`
` .........I am already at this age.`
` All the days of my life until now have been in repayment for the Master's favor."`
`"...Whatever happens to a senile old man like myself will be decided by the roulette.`
` I think I would like to sit here and see what the result will be with my own eyes."`
`As Genji said that, he sat down.`
`As though saying that he didn't intend to discuss this anymore, ...his gaze fell to the chessboard that he had played on with Nanjo.`
`When George saw this, he decided to leave Genji there.`
`"Let's go, everyone.`
` It looks like the wind is a little softer right now!"`
`George took an umbrella and dashed out into the hallway, and Shannon and Gohda chased after him, each holding a tool.`
`......After they flew out of the room, Genji quietly extended his hand to the side of the chessboard.`
`.........He softly pulled something that was there towards himself, and hid it by covering it with his palm.`
`Genji killed his breathing even more than before.`
`{n}.........As he did, .........something flashed gold.`
`From inside an ice pail set on the counter, ...a small gold butterfly appeared, softly and silently.`
`It was almost as though it had watched George and the rest leave, and was trying to secretly follow them......`
`It happened in an instant.`
`...The gold butterfly, elegantly flapping its wings, was pinned against the wall by the knife Genji had thrown, just like a butterfly in a bug collection.`
`After the gold butterfly beat its wings several times, looking like it was in pain, it accepted the fact that it couldn't break free, became fine gold powder and smoke, and disappeared as though dissolving into water...`
`Genji's gaze was still lowered at the chessboard, as though nothing had happened.`
`......Maybe he would think up a brilliant move very soon.`
`But no matter what move he made, his opponent would not be able to respond for all eternity.`
`Even though he knew that, Genji searched for a brilliant move.`
`......It must have been the perfect way to kill time, during the short period before some fate would be given to him...`
`......He didn't know what result the roulette would bring about.`
`{n}But that decision would be made very soon.`
`.........No one could interfere with the tumbling roulette ball...`
`The door to the parlor was not only locked, but blocked with a barricade made of sofas and the like.`
`So Auntie Rosa seemed to suspect that if a suspicious person appeared, it would be by breaking the window.`
`Sitting on a one‐person sofa, her back to the door, she continued to hold onto her gun.`
`I didn't know what was what anymore, and so, my body and mind worn out, I was just playing with Maria however she wanted.`
`In Maria's words,`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice} was testing us to see whether we could solve the epitaph of the gold, so we had to challenge this riddle.`
`In the beginning, I had been a little interested, and had tried to solve it, but I didn't have a clue what those weird paragraphs even meant in the first place.`
`......I didn't doubt that there was some riddle hidden there, but I couldn't imagine that I would solve it by chance.`
`In the middle part of the epitaph, there were lines saying to journey to the Golden Land, over the course of the first to the tenth twilight.`
`On the first twilight, sacrifice the six chosen by the key.`
`{n}On the second twilight, those who remain shall tear apart the two who are close.`
`It was obvious that this hinted at the first six murders that had already occurred in the chapel, and Jessica and Kanon‐kun's murders.`
`If this was being followed, we would have to be prepared for yet five more people to be killed.`
`On the fourth twilight, gouge the head and kill.`
`{n}On the fifth twilight, gouge the chest and kill.`
`{n}On the sixth twilight, gouge the stomach and kill.`
`{n}On the seventh twilight, gouge the knee and kill.`
`{n}On the eighth twilight, gouge the leg and kill.`
`The bodies of Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa baa‐chan hadn't been found.`
`...However, if we reasonably assumed that they were the sacrifices of the fourth and fifth twilights,`
` ......they would surely be found in a pitiful state, with their head and chest gouged.`
`In which case, could we expect that three more would be gouged in the stomach, knee, and leg, and be killed?`
`......Who would that be?`
`{n}...I looked around the room, noticing that there were three people here, but, how should I say it, my emotions seemed paralyzed.`
`...Strangely, I didn't find it terrifying.`
`Maria noticed me, with my upper body entrusted to the sofa, gazing lazily up at the ceiling.`
`...Apparently, she felt I was slacking off in my riddle‐solving.`
`{n}She got mad at me, and told me I wasn't being serious enough.`
`"......Hey, Maria."`
`"Uu...?"`
`"What was it again, that {f:5:Beatrice} said she would do if we solved this?"`
`I was sure that the witch had written in her letter that she would give up on collecting the interest, or something abstract like that.`
`...I was optimistically taking that to mean that she would give up on killing the whole family,`
` ......but was it really written with that meaning?`
`I didn't really feel that solving this riddle would actually save us.`
`.........I thought that even if we did solve it, that would be doing just what the culprit wanted us to, and it would all be a wasted effort...`
`"No, that's not true.`
` ......If you solve the epitaph, Beato's ritual will be over.`
` So there won't be any need for more people to die."`
`"......Really?`
` Isn't that rule just something she made up...?`
` If we solve this riddle, ...we'll probably know the location of Grandfather's hidden gold.`
` ...She'll surely go after that and—"`
`"Uu.`
` Won't."`
`"...How...can you be so sure?"`
`"The gold was Beato's from the start.`
` She won't go after something that's hers."`
`"......Then, ...then why is Beato giving us all these big hints?`
` ......Not just that, why did she even set up this game‐like thing?"`
`"Magic needs risk."`
`"......Risk.`
` ...I don't really get what you mean."`
`"For example, in a marathon,`
` ......do you think that a medal that anyone can get by running the whole thing is worth the same as the medal given only to the person who gets first...?"`
`"No, I don't...`
` ......What are you trying to say? That in the end, she's just playing around?`
` Purposefully giving us a chance—"`
`"Noooooo.`
` That's what magic {i:is}.`
` No matter how great the magic, there are always risks and weak points.`
` No, there has to be."`
`"...I don't get it when you call it magic, ...but if I think about it as a gamble, I can understand a little.`
` If you aren't prepared to lose big, then you can't win big.`
` And the slimmer the chances of winning, the bigger the payoff."`
`"That's it, exactly.`
` That's why Beato properly explained the risk of the ritual to everyone.`
` That's why, if this riddle is solved, the ritual will be interrupted as promised.`
` After all, if she breaks her promises, then there wouldn't be any risk."`
`"If we solve this, ...will she really keep her promise?"`
`"Why are flowers beautiful even though they wither?`
` Why is it that an artificial flower isn't beautiful, even if it's so elaborate you can't tell the difference by looking?"`
`"Humans can bring about miracles by gambling their death.`
` If there were an undying human, that person would have no way of bringing about a miracle.`
` .........It's the same for us, for life, for witches and for rituals.`
` If we don't bear a risk, we can't achieve anything."`
`"......What do we do if we solve the riddle?`
` Do we press our answer buzzers and put a hand in the air, tell the witch our answer and see what she says?"`
`"Uu.`
` I don't know about that.`
` But, if we solve it, the ritual will surely end automatically."`
`"........................`
` ...You sure know a lot, Maria.`
` ...Did you learn all of that......from {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"Uu."`
`So, ...if you don't bear a risk, nothing can be gained.`
` That is doubtlessly the way of the world, ......but it was in conflict with the chessboard theory style of thinking that I liked.`
`A move in chess is always a search for the best play, that minimizes the risk, and promises an advantageous turn of events.`
`You don't trust your plays to chance, like in gambling.`
` ......That's right, there's no room for gambling in an intellectual game.`
`And yet, this person called {f:5:Beatrice} was carrying out such an outrageous crime,`
` ...or maybe a ritual,`
` ......while purposefully imposing conditions for her own loss and announcing them to us.`
`In chess, you always play the best move.`
`{n}So by standing in your opponent's position, you can predict their next move.`
`...However, you couldn't say for sure that {f:5:Beatrice}'s moves were always the best moves.`
`I thought she was probably making us focus on the epitaph as a smokescreen, to mislead us about something.`
`......But Maria said that of all things was impossible.`
`She said that this was a genuine risk that the witch had taken, and therefore proof that this was a formal magical ritual.`
`.........I can't understand this witch called {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`She must be committing this chain of murders with some goal in mind,`
` ......so why would she deliberately expose the conditions for her own defeat?`
`......No matter how I flip over the chessboard and think from my opponent's perspective, ......I can't understand why she would give up if this riddle was solved.`
`Isn't it almost as though {f:5:Beatrice}...doesn't care whether she wins or loses?`
` It's natural that chessboard reasoning wouldn't work if you played chess against an opponent like this...`
`...I don't understand, I don't understand.`
` ......What is {f:5:Beatrice} after that's making her commit this crime?`
`If she just wants to massacre us all, she could just do it secretly, without this whole crazy setup.`
` There was no need for that scrupulous advance notice, dramatic suggestions of locked rooms, or anything.`
`...It's all over‐dramatized.`
`{n}I don't get the point at all.`
`As long as I continue to think of {f:5:Beatrice} as a greedy human culprit, will I be unable to understand anything?`
`...If I don't accept her as a witch, will I be unable to even set the pieces on the chessboard at all......?`
`......If she really is a witch, and everything Maria has said is true...`
`...then there's only one thing we should have been doing.`
`{n}...We shouldn't have bothered with any of the reasoning or the discord or the searching for the culprit.`
`We should have all gathered in the dining hall, and pooled our knowledge to solve the riddle.`
` If we had pooled the knowledge of that many people, maybe we would have been able to at least grasp a thread of the answer...`
`We greedy humans, desiring to gain something more than one another, ......never pooled our knowledge, and were being offered up as sacrifices one by one.`
`.........In the end, were we humans getting what we deserved?`
` We thought we were thinking, ...but we were actually thinking only of our greedy selves.`
`In the end, chessboard theory is a technique of thinking where you project yourself on your opponent.`
` ......So greedy people look inside their opponents and see their greedy selves...`
`I looked vaguely at Auntie Rosa.`
`She was probably tired from being under all this tension the whole time.`
`{n}She wasn't sleeping, but she was continually staring vaguely at some point off in space.`
`Auntie Rosa had proclaimed that she couldn't trust anyone who had not been killed.`
`......Auntie Rosa's chessboard thinking......saw herself inside her opponent.`
`...In other words, Auntie Rosa...`
`...might be an isolated woman, unable to trust anyone and unable to let her guard down.`
`...Long ago, I think I heard a bit about it from my dad.`
`{n}Auntie Rosa had originally been a very obedient child.`
`......But because her age was so far separated from her other siblings,`
` and because her confrontational siblings had often made conflicting demands of her,`
` she had been going through psychological hardship ever since she was young.`
`Apparently, when she had taken the side of one sibling, often another gave her a hard time for it.`
`Certainly Auntie Rosa had said many things today that could be taken as abusive language.`
` .........But those were words that had been engraved into her vocabulary because they had been showered upon her as well.`
`The many abusive words that she had spoken......were also the same abuse that Auntie Rosa had been showered with in the past...`
`...Now that I think about it, I have the feeling that her style of speech today has had occasional traces of Uncle Krauss and Auntie Eva in it.`
`......I'd just assumed the similarity came from being siblings, ...but maybe that wasn't the case...`
`For the first time, I was able to sympathize from my heart with Auntie Rosa, who I had come to think of as being only gentle...`
`Then, what about Maria...?`
`{n}Maria had been claiming something for a while.`
`If we could solve the riddle that the witch had presented to us, the ritual would be halted and we would definitely be saved.`
`And I think she also said that {f:5:Beatrice} would never break a promise she made.`
`......So that describes Maria herself.`
`{n}She's the one with the most innocent heart, who would never break a promise...`
`So she believed that {f:5:Beatrice} wouldn't break a promise either.`
`{n}She could believe that.`
`But wasn't that just an image of {f:5:Beatrice} that Maria imagined...?`
` There's no proof that the real {f:5:Beatrice} definitely keeps her promises, right...?`
`"`
`{p:1:I keep my promises}.`
` If you solve the riddle of the epitaph, you shall be able to reach the Golden Land.`
` When that happens, the ritual will end.`
` No more people will die."`
`"......So you're saying a complete monster like you follows the rules?"`
`"I won't deny that I am brutal and unjust and a monster."`
`"......However, I am a witch.`
` I use magic.`
` In order to use magic, there are some rules that must be followed.`
` ...It is precisely because I am a witch that I cannot neglect those.`
` You should believe at least that much."`
`".....................`
` ......Even after pulling all this shit, you're still telling me to trust in at least the rules?"`
`"......I do play tricks.`
` Of course, I also deceive people.`
` That's no different from humans.`
` ......But not once have I disregarded something that I have said as a promise."`
`"What about you humans?`
` Do you always keep your promises?"`
`"............Given that we have catchphrases like "keep your promises",`
` ...it's doubtful that we always follow them as we should."`
`"From my perspective, humans are much more selfish monsters.`
` ......There's nothing as doubtful as a human's promise.`
` Even I sometimes make contracts with humans, but I doubt you can even imagine how strict an agreement must be made just to grant a single foolish wish."`
`"...If there's even a small loophole, they'll immediately say something like "increase the number of wishes to one hundred", or "try transforming into a tiny speck"."`
`"......Dad often tells me something.`
` He says that there's nothing as scary as contracts.`
` ......He said it's only natural that people who agree without reading them thoroughly will be chewed to the bone.`
` ...He made a killing through vice."`
`"............Realize this.`
` People do not know of fraud from birth.`
` ...They suffer it somewhere.`
` And so it is learned."`
`"..........................."`
`"Yes, the sins of the human world, which must be forced on one another.`
` ......Now who was the witch I heard that from...?`
` Oh well.`
` ......I'm not as heartless as you think, you see?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Liar!!`
` All these people, and it's not even the first time!!`
` And you did it in such a horrible way too, how could you not be heartless?!!"`
`"You say you keep your promises?!`
` Don't say stuff like that!!`
` I won't accept you.`
` Never.`
` I believe that not giving that up is the only way I can resist you!"`
`"............I see.`
` So you're saying that this eternal torment will be the same for me.`
` .........*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`"......Maybe so.`
` One thousand years is a long time......`
` Maybe a witch's true strength is decided not by their magical power, but by their endurance.`
` ...Yes, it explains how terrifying Lady Bern is."`
`"Damn you, babbling on and on about incomprehensible stuff.`
` .........Hurry up and continue that eternal torment or whatever.`
` I'm prepared to stick around for a thousand years, or even ten thousand."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Good, good.`
` It looks like you've regained some of your will to fight.`
` It would be boring otherwise."`
`"Come now, don't you often see it in multiplayer games?`
` You enter as a new challenger, but the opponent is so weak that it's a bit of an anticlimax, so you lose on purpose to extend the game until the last round,`
` then get serious and beat them to a pulp, riiight?"`
`"......I don't get the analogy."`
`"It's the same as wine.`
` If you don't let it age well, it won't sparkle."`
`"......You are a wine that can withstand that process.`
` I'll age you carefully.`
` ......I'll raise you to be the best alcohol to color my elegant time..."`
`"So don't let this much break you.`
` Keep on denying me.`
` After all, as long as you don't accept me, I'm nothing more than a fleeting illusion.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"...............No matter how many times I see it, ......it's awful."`
`"......I sympathize with all my heart.`
` ......Shannon‐san, please get the key.`
` ......Even though she has passed away, Madam is a lady.`
` I cannot touch her."`
`".........Yes."`
`Shannon nodded sharply, her expression filled with a sense of duty.`
`George, Gohda and Shannon had broken a suitable window, and were inside the chapel.`
`{n}...Since they really hadn't wanted to break one, they had searched for another way in, just in case.`
`...But, in the end, that only proved once again that there was nowhere that anyone could slip in through,`
` and emphasized further how inscrutable was the chapel's locked room...`
`Inside the chapel, time had stopped since they had left it earlier.`
`Of course, even George could not approach that horrible Halloween party again.`
`It was only natural.`
` Because it made him remember again the sadness of losing both of his parents at once.`
`......And Gohda, thinking of the possibility that their bodies might have changed in some horrible way now that a half of a day had passed, didn't want to let George approach.`
`Shannon followed Gohda's instructions, and approached the party table...`
`...Normally, Shannon might have resented having another dirty job forced on her.`
` ......But now, she could truly understand Gohda's mental state.`
`Despite Gohda's prodigious skill, he had gotten into trouble, lost his job, and been left out in the streets, and then Natsuhi had given him a new life.`
`......Even though it had just been a casual employment for Natsuhi, Gohda must have felt that it was a turning point in his fate.`
`...Those around Gohda could see that he felt a special kind of loyalty to Natsuhi.`
` ......So he probably didn't want to lose that feeling, even though she was dead.`
`......Now that half a day had passed, the bodies of Natsuhi and the rest had changed completely.`
`{n}Small bugs that had sniffed out the smell of death had started to gather.`
`{n}...It really wasn't something you could look at directly...`
`"......Madam, ............excuse me......"`
`Because of her long experience as a servant, Shannon had an idea of which pocket Natsuhi had kept the key to her room in.`
`.........Probably, in this pocket...`
`Her guess didn't fail her.`
` Just by touching the outside of the pocket, she was immediately able to feel it...`
`"It's here.`
` ......The key to Madam's room."`
`Shannon held the key up high, showing the others that it had been found.`
`As George and Gohda watched her, their eyes opened wide...`
`{n}That wasn't the expression Shannon was expecting, so it startled her.`
`Because Shannon hadn't noticed.`
`{n}George and Gohda, watching from afar, had been able to notice it first.`
`Because when Shannon had held the key up high, ......a blizzard of gold leaf had billowed up from around the table.`
`They were...countless gold butterflies.`
`Because it was the first time George had seen them, to him, they might have looked fantastical.`
`......But Gohda already knew.`
`{n}...He knew that those gold butterflies, far from being beautiful, held sway over something disastrous.`
`And that gold swelled, trying to suck Shannon in.........`
`"Sh‐Shannon‐san!!`
` Run!!"`
`"Huh?!`
` Kyaa!!!"`
`Shannon also realized that she was about to be swallowed up by gold butterflies.`
`She ran unsteadily, her expression still shocked.`
`{n}As she did, the gold butterflies danced around Shannon in unison.`
`{n}They grouped together.`
` They tried to swallow her up!`
`"Shannonnnnn!!`
` Damn it, what is this?!`
` Are these...the gold butterflies you guys were talking about?!"`
`"Outside, quickly!!`
` You bastards!`
` Damn it, damn it!!"`
`George and Gohda rushed up to Shannon, driving off the group of butterflies.`
`{n}And while the butterflies were scattered, they ran towards the broken window!`
`However, they needed good footing to get out of the window, which was surrounded with shards of broken glass.`
`When they had entered, there had been enough time to prepare for that, but now there was none.`
`"Let's go out through the door!!`
` There's no time to look for footing!"`
`"......I‐`
`...it won't open...!`
` It's stuck...!"`
`"Give it to me!!`
` Damn this ancient piece of crap—`
`nnnnnnnn!!"`
`"George‐sama, quickly!!`
` Damn it, you want a piece of me?! Uooooooooooooooohhh!!"`
`Gohda took off his jacket, swinging it around and scattering the group of butterflies.`
`{n}But he was vastly outnumbered.`
`{n}It was doubtful that it even bought them a short amount of time.`
`George struggled with the virtually broken handle.`
`{n}Its age showed, and it didn't turn well.`
`Brute force alone won't do it, it needs the right angle or some trick......`
`"George‐sama!!`
` Damn iiiiiiiiiiiit!!`
` You monsteeers!!"`
`......Just then, Gohda saw it.`
`......He was seen by it.`
` In other words, their eyes met.`
`On top of the party table,`
` ......no, floating above it, backed by a stained glass window, laughing: the figure of the witch.`
`He saw the figure of the witch, laughing in the center of the golden whirlwind, allowing the gold butterflies to attend to her whims.`
`"...............`
`B‐`
`......{f:5:Beatrice}........."`
`It should have been Gohda's first meeting with her.`
`{n}...But he knew her at a glance.`
`Just like the other servants had said, this was certainly, certainly...the witch of the portrait herself...!`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, hahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` It is almost time for dinner, is it not?`
` ......I am already the host of this mansion.`
` So I must give you a warm reception with a wonderful dinner.`
` ......And how perfectly ideal, there are {i:three} of you!`
` ......My, my, how truly, truly convenient!!"`
`"U‐...uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`"I‐it opened!!"`
`"Gohda‐san, quickly...!!`
` ............!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}......sama..."`
`"Huh?!`
` ...............?!?!"`
`"Are you sure you want to just stand there...?`
` If you think this place is suitable for your cemetery, then very well.`
` *cackle*cackle*!!`
` I'll praise your spirit for wanting to stay by your former masters' side, serving them even after death!"`
`The golden whirlwind enshrouding the witch burst.`
`It was like...an evil hand had literally spread its fingers and was trying to attack them!`
`The group of gold butterflies attacked with a "whoosh" sound.`
`"Hurry!!`
` We can't stand here!!"`
`George's voice brought Shannon and Gohda back to themselves.`
`{n}Standing here now would be the same as a frog being stared down by a snake.`
`They had to resist.`
`{n}......They had to fight this incarnation of the new, brutal, and frightening order that had enveloped Rokkenjima...!`
`There was no time to take out their umbrellas.`
`{n}The three of them dashed out into the pouring rain.`
`They never realized because they didn't turn around,`
` but the gold butterflies apparently couldn't handle the rain too well, and this hampered their ability to chase after the three.`
`The three people ran from their golden pursuers and flew into the mansion...`
`"............*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` How nice, how nice.`
` If it wasn't like this, it wouldn't be interesting!"`
`They unlocked the door, and flew into the room.`
`A bit of the scent from Natsuhi's favorite gentle incense remained in the room.`
`...However, there was no time to let that calm them now.`
`"Where is it?!`
` You said it was in a treasure box, right...?!"`
`"It's just something I heard...!`
` I never knew where it actually...!"`
`".........I, I think it's probably in her dresser, or in the corner by the bed!"`
`Shannon claimed that because of her woman's sense.`
` But in the corner by the bed, there was only an incense burner, a half‐read novel, and a pair of glasses.`
`But the dresser was elegant and had many drawers, and it would be understandable if she had kept some of her valuables there.`
`"Auntie Natsuhi, I'm sorry...!!"`
`He began to violently open each one of the drawers.`
`{n}He had to hurry.`
`He couldn't actually hear footsteps, ...but he had the feeling that the witch was approaching...`
`He had the feeling that her laugh was approaching...!!`
`He pulled out the drawers one by one and examined their contents.`
`......Every small box for makeup looked like a treasure box,`
` and the amount of effort it would take to inspect all of them made him feel a little dizzy.`
`"May‐......maybe it's this box...`
` It's locked, and I can't open it...!"`
`At a glance, it looked slightly larger than a music box.`
`{n}When shaken, it rustled, as though various small objects were inside.`
`{n}But it was locked and wouldn't open!`
`"N‐normally, you'd hide the key somewhere nearby.`
` ...But maybe some people always take it with them......`
` I don't know, ...I don't know...!!"`
`"There's no choice—let's break it!`
` But we can't do it recklessly, right, we might break the mirror inside.`
` Isn't there some tool we could pry it open with...?!`
` Damn it...!!"`
`Gohda looked all over the room, trying to see if there was some tool that they could use.`
`{n}And he noticed the door, which had been left open ever since they had entered.`
`He approached the door to close it, ......and noticed the abominable shadows of people approaching from beyond the darkness in the hall...`
`No, the phrase "shadows of people" wasn't right.`
`{n}Because that referred to {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} shadows.`
`......You can't call the shadows of beings that aren't {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} "shadows of people"!!`
`"...............G‐`
`......George‐sama!!!`
` H‐`
`......hurry......"`
`Gohda's voice trailed off...`
`{n}It was the shock from seeing a procession of those not of this world.`
`He was a servant.`
`{n}So he knew all of the servants that worked for the Ushiromiya family.`
`...But he didn't know about these.`
`{n}However, they were definitely servants...!!`
`They weren't servants working for Ushiromiya Kinzo or Ushiromiya Krauss.`
`...They were new servants, who worked for the new master of the mansion, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice},`
` and who had goats' heads and bright‐red, boiled eyes of lava!!`
`As the new master laughed loudly and trimly directed six of the new servants,`
` he saw her pierce the darkness as she came.`
`...Of course, she was clad in the gold butterflies that were her symbol.`
`Gohda hurriedly closed the door and locked it!`
`However, the instant he locked it, it returned to normal, just as though it had been knocked back by a spring or something!`
`It almost gave the illusion that some prankster on the other side of the door was opening it every time he closed it.`
`......Distance‐wise, they shouldn't have reached the other side of the door yet!!`
`Then who, how...?!`
`It felt just like playing with a broken toy.`
`Click, boing.`
`{n}Click, boing!!`
`"U‐uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!`
` I‐it won't close!!`
` It opens even if I close it!`
` What's going on, damnitdamnitdamnitdamnit!!"`
`"Ku‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha...!!`
` Did you think a lock would stop me?`
` Did you think the door to that room would inhibit the room's new master?!"`
`It was like the witch could see Gohda's frantic effort through the door.`
`Even as he struggled, their footsteps continued to approach.`
`And when not just footsteps, but their breath too could be heard,`
` Gohda gave up on the lock and rammed the door with his shoulder, making the lock his own large body.`
`"......George‐sama, quickly quickly quickly!!!"`
`"George‐sama, what about this?!"`
`"A letter opener!`
` That's better, let me have it!`
` The fountain pen isn't working!"`
`George took it, and once again dug into the crack under the lid of the treasure box.`
`{n}...It looks like it's working...!`
`"Quickly quickly!!`
` HiiIIiii,`
` UOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!"`
`The pressure from across the door grew even stronger.`
`......Gohda screamed.`
` It wasn't a war cry for this test of strength.`
`{n}......He was terrified.`
`He was simply terrified that, except for a single wooden door, he would be touching something not of this world.`
`But he was still lucky.`
`{n}He wasn't touching them directly.`
`{n}Because they were on the other side of the door.`
`So it was natural that if he did touch them directly, ...Gohda's cry would turn from something brave into a shameful,`
` ...and yet very real scream that would make glass shatter.`
`Gohda couldn't believe what was right before his eyes.`
`...Going through the door,`
` ...an arm,`
` ......an arm,`
` ......almost as though it was sticking through the surface of water,`
` slipped through, as though it was perfectly natural, and stroked the back of Gohda's hand as he tried desperately to hold the door closed.`
`.........It...`
`traced slowly up his arm,`
` ...to his chest,`
` ...and then...`
`......his chin.`
`By now, Gohda's scream was not even vocalized.`
`{n}He could hear a sweet whispering voice from across the door.`
`......It wasn't coming from the witch, but judging by the sound of the voice, it was a young woman.`
`...But there was no difference in the fact that it was a voice from one not of this world.`
`"......*giggle*giggle*.`
` How cuuute.`
` ......Hey. You see it, right? Your life flashing before your eyes.`
` ......Tell me. When it's over."`
`"HIIIIIIIIIiiiiiIIIIIIIIIIIiiiiIIIIiii!!"`
`"Thanks.`
` Over already, huh?`
` ......*giggle*giggle*!"`
`That obscene arm burst apart.`
` And they heard the sound of something jumping around the room at an incredible speed.`
`They didn't know what it was.`
`{n}Incredibly fast, small, like steel or maybe a beetle...!`
`When it buried itself right in the center of Gohda's chest and stopped,`
` .........for the first time,`
` ...they realized that its true form...`
`...was something like a stake with a strange design on it......`
`Gohda's large body shook, ...`
`...bent backwards,`
` ......and fell over.`
`As it did, the door opened softly, even though no one was pushing it,`
` ......and the new masters of this room were welcomed in.`
`It looked almost as though the door itself had accepted them.`
`The goat attendants entered one after another, six of them...!!`
`Then that witch entered, and the gold butterflies entered!!`
`The room was wrapped in a blizzard of gold leaf, which fell and piled up, turning it into a world of gold...!!`
`".........Shannon.`
` The roulette has chosen you and George.`
` Thank me for your day of release.`
` I assume you have no regrets?"`
`"None at all, riiight?`
` Receiving an engagement ring from the man you fell for, and then being killed before spending a night together, that isn't a regret at all, riiiiiiiiiiiiight???`
` You wanted him to teach you the happiness of being a woman, didn't yooouuu?`
` Kuhihihyahya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hyahya!!"`
`"Ahh, no, no, Shannon, it's hanging! Your regret. From your mouth.`
` I can see it dribbling from your moooooooouth, Shannonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn???`
` Hiiihya{0}hya{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha`
` kyaaa{0}kya{0}kkya{0}kkya{0}kkya{0}kkya{0}kkya!!!"`
`Crack.`
` It was the sound of the lid to the treasure box breaking and opening.`
`When George turned it over, out fell accessories, charms,`
` ......various small objects that Natsuhi had treasured when she was a girl.`
`...Mixed in with those was a pouch that stood out from the rest.`
`He picked it up, and checked it immediately.`
` .........This was it.`
`"I found it—this is it........."`
`"One move short.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"Die!"`
`"......Da‐damn it!!"`
`All at once, the gold butterflies attacked George, who was painfully slowly trying to remove the contents of the pouch.`
`Just then, it seemed like, for just an instant, a bright red flash lit up the room...`
`That red flash seemed to wipe out the gold butterflies that were raging around the room, ......within a circle drawn with Shannon at the center...`
`......Therefore, it was a very divine scene.`
` ...Almost as though a single streak of light had cut through the clouds in the ceiling, in this world of gold...`
`George, who was curled in a ball trying to protect himself from the group of butterflies, didn't have a clue what had occurred.`
`......Then he noticed that Shannon was blocking the way to him, shielding him,`
` with a serious face that she had never shown him before, as she glared at the witch and the rest...`
`".........I'd forgotten.`
` You were also Kinzo's excellent furniture.`
` And you've matured much more than Kanon, ......"`
`"..................How dare you...do that to Kanon‐kun.`
` .........Not the fact that you killed him.`
` ...How dare you...erase his remains,`
` ...and even try to disgrace his honor......"`
`"Come now, Shannonnnnn, is that what's making you maaad?`
` If you're lonely because you can't meet Kanon, just ask meee, I'll bring you together anytiiiiime!!"`
`When the witch snapped her fingers, ......one of the six goat attendants......glittered gold and changed into Kanon.`
`It was definitely a sight to make one doubt their eyes.`
`{n}...It was definitely Kanon's face.`
`......However, in those eyes, there was none of that sincere glint of Kanon's.`
`...They were only the clouded eyes of furniture that did nothing but obey the orders of the witch.`
`...George couldn't understand the scene right before his eyes.`
`{n}......And he finally understood why Gohda and the rest had been unable to talk about what they had seen in the servant room.`
`".........Is it fun?"`
`"Oh yeah, it's fun.`
` It's always fun to reunite two that have been torn apart by death.`
` Because I get to enjoy it thrice—once tearing the two apart by death, once reuniting them, and once tearing them apart again."`
`"So, Kanonnn, play with your sister.`
` If she knocks you about, show her a face with as much anguish as you can manage.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`......From the impostor Kanon's arm, ...a strangely shining trail extended.`
`{n}.........It planned to tear Shannon apart with that.`
`......Shannon, who still hadn't prepared her heart, apart with a single stroke...`
`"......I won't forgive you.`
` ......For dishonoring the dead not once, ...but twice, ...I won't forgive you."`
`"Stop babbling, get killed by your brother, Shannonnnnn,`
` I'm sure you'll be able to have a good dreeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaam!!!"`
`As the impostor Kanon drew several purple trails, he definitely had attacked Shannon...`
`But when he flew at Shannon, ......it felt like some kind of invisible wall had been set up in front of her.`
`A bright red ripple trail was left on the wall, ......and it repelled the impostor.`
`......No, it didn't repel him, it smashed him.`
` ......It knocked him back, turning him into golden dust, into pieces, scattering him...!`
`The figure of the foolish furniture, who had mocked Kanon's form and even disgraced his honor after his death, broke into countless gold butterflies,`
` and then those butterflies themselves broke into pieces, and those pieces were broken into pieces,`
` until they were no longer butterflies, but a spray of gold, and disappeared.`
`"......Sha‐...............Shannon..............."`
`"............George‐san, please don't move from there.`
` I don't want to shift the central axis."`
`"This is.........a surprise!!`
` Even though you make a face like you wouldn't hurt a fly, .........you can display such power?!!"`
`"I see, so the spirit mirror is lending you power...`
` But you don't have the preparations or the time to draw out the true power of that spirit mirror."`
`"I won't give you either one.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The spirit mirror George gripped was letting out a divine radiance, and displaying its strength not to submit to wicked power.`
`But that radiance was no match for the witch's sinister nature...`
`"This is why furniture is frightening!`
` That feeling, like unexpectedly hitting the corner of a cabinet with your little toe."`
`"...This is why furniture is frightening!!`
` You furniture, furniture furnituuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure!!"`
`"............I am not furniture.`
` ...And I think you are very pitiful right now."`
`"Whaat...?`
` Hohh.`
` ......I wonder, what did this furniture, who hasn't lived even a hundred years, just say to a witch of one thousand......?"`
`"......You are a very pitiful person.`
` .........Of course there will be lingering regrets between two people who love each other.`
` But there isn't even a scrap of the kind of regrets you're hoping for."`
`"You dare speak, furniture...!!`
` When you say that, have you forgotten the days that you wanted to be tied to George so much that you licked my shoes?!!"`
`"Living with love, and crawling in muck is what humans do.`
` For sneering at that and thinking you can look down on it, you are far inferior to them."`
`"Especially now, I think you are pitiful.`
` ......How much does it mean for a loving couple to consummate their love?"`
`"......It does mean something, it definitely does.`
` ...But it's completely different from what you're saying.`
` It means something more sacred, so sacred that one such as you has no right to speak of it wickedly."`
`"So I no longer have any regrets.`
` George‐san and I have sworn our love to each other.`
` As proof, I accepted the ring."`
`"......With that, our eternal vows were completed!`
` No matter how you torture us with your wicked magic and your malice, you cannot disgrace that for all eternity!!"`
`"......Ha!`
` Don't speak as a poet like it's so neat and clean!!`
` Love is lust it can't be talked about with only pretty words like in a shoujo manga.`
` Men are flies and maggots that get caught in your scent and gather around you.`
` Do you still not understand that at your aaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aage?"`
`"You'll despair, when you get even one glimpse of the black‐as‐tar lust of that glasses man behind you,`
` you'll be devastated speechless no words no reaction no expression no goddamn good at all Shannoo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oonnn{-}n{-}n{-}n{-}n{-}n{-}n{-}n{-}n{-}n{-}n{-}n{-}nnnnn???`
` Hiiiihaaaaa{0}aa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haaa{0}haaa!!"`
`"That's enough stop talking furniture you furniture furniture furniture,`
` who the hell do you think you are talking like that, love is just a fraud how to pretty up something that's ultimately filthy as all hell,"`
`"Don't people become adults when they realize thaaaaaaaaaat, die you trash, furniture furniture scrap,`
` I'll turn you into a filthy maggot then we'll see whether that glasses guy still loves you,"`
`"I'll show you the goddamn filthy reality of his looooooooooooove,`
` die you piece of craaaaaaaaaaaaap don't you tell me about looooooooooooooooooove!!"`
`The invisible column of light with Shannon at the center started to have bright red ripples drawn all over it at once.`
`...The wall did its best to withstand the invisible malice that was trying to corrode it from all directions.`
`"What is this you call that resiiiisssting?!"`
`"You're insignificant you're frail, just like the pretty picture you try to paint, just a frail pretense,`
` you're just hiding what you don't want to see by covering it with a veil do you stiiill not understand that's why you're furniture you fuuuuuurniture,"`
`"see see see see see it's chipping awaaaaaaaaay crackcrunchsmacksnap how thin how shameful,`
` compared to your frail resistance Parmigiano‐Reggiano would take muuch more effort to shaaaaaaaaaaaaaave`
` hiiyahhaaahahaah!!"`
`The golden windstorm that covered the room gradually shaved away the walls of the column that protected Shannon and George.`
`The bright‐red ripples frantically drew a pattern of resistance, but the wall was beginning to envelop the two, becoming instead a red wall of despair...`
`"............George‐san, I'm sorry......`
` .........It was impossible...`
`......for me,`
` ...after all........."`
`"......Yes... Thank you.`
` ...You fought for my sake.`
` ...That alone makes me happy."`
`...As the column that had once protected them was assaulted and covered with a trail of bloodcurdling red ripples, it contracted,`
` ...and began to suck the two of them up instead.`
`"George‐san, can I ask a favor?"`
`Shannon grasped George's hand behind her.`
`{n}So George hugged her shoulders just as strongly.`
`"What is it?"`
`"Before the end, ......please let me hear you say you love me."`
`"Sure.`
` ...Sayo, I will forever"`
`After Genji finished taking his late meal, he went out to do the nighttime rounds inside the mansion.`
`He reheated the soup that Gohda had started making, and ate some random leftovers from the refrigerator.`
`They were all things Gohda had made himself, and were, of course, delicious.`
`He had half‐heartedly gone to ask Rosa and the others what they would do for dinner, but he had been yelled at by a voice telling him that they had canned food so they were fine, and the door wasn't even opened for him.`
`......So, ironically, it was the servant Genji who was able to eat the more delicious meal...`
`But even though all of those crimes had been committed, and many people had already met a brutal end,`
` ......why was it that Genji wasn't afraid to do the rounds all by himself?`
`...Judging by his appearance as he carried out his normal tasks without a trace of fear, as though everything was normal,`
` you might think that all of the horrible events that had happened today were just a dream or an illusion.`
`Was he taking a philosophic view, or was it simply resignation?`
`Genji must have considered it a virtue to systematically carry out his duty until the last moment,`
` since the fate that awaited him was unavoidable.`
`It would probably be eternally impossible to perceive the depths of his heart, unless he told of it himself......`
`Because he had given the master key back to Rosa, the places he could go to were extremely limited.`
`All he could do was walk around the hallways, checking to make sure that the windows were closed.`
`{n}So he was able to go around that route far more quickly than usual.`
`".......................................`
` ......mgh."`
`After the sound of a moderate knock,`
` Auntie Rosa, who had been falling into a doze shortly before, jumped and woke up, pointing the barrel of the gun at the door as she yelled.`
`"Who is it?!"`
`I was napping on a sofa, and that voice also brought me back to reality.`
`"......Rosa‐sama.`
` It is Genji."`
`"Do you have some business?`
` We'll be fine without opening the door.`
` Tell us from there."`
`".........Yes.`
` Well then, forgive me for speaking in this fashion.`
` ...I have found the bodies of Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa."`
`"Wh‐...what did you say...?!!"`
`"............I see.`
` Alright, let's go and check them.`
` ...Until I see the corpses, I won't believe anybody."`
`"....................."`
`"......Uu.`
` It's alright, Battler.`
` If you're with me, it'll definitely be alright."`
`Maybe my face was shadowed with anxiety.`
`{n}...Maria grasped my hand with her small hand, and spoke softly, trying to give me courage.`
`Since it was Auntie Rosa's job to ready the gun and stand guard, it fell to me to remove the barricade of sofas.`
`When I finished, I took a backward glance at Auntie Rosa, who was pointing the barrel of the gun over my shoulder, and opened the door.`
`"Genji‐san, where are their corpses...?"`
`".........In the courtyard.`
` I shall guide you."`
`"Battler‐kun, wait!`
` Just in case, I'm going to check the doors and windows of this room before we go.`
` Wait a second."`
`Auntie Rosa called me to a halt to prevent me from going on ahead, and began to carefully check the locks on each of the windows.`
`......But those locks had already been checked once.`
`......It felt kind of unpleasant, as though she suspected that I might have secretly unlocked them when she wasn't looking.`
`...No, maybe she was right to be this cautious...`
`Even though it was called a courtyard, it wasn't really a pretty place you could take a walk in like the rose garden.`
`On the contrary, since it was surrounded by the mansion on all sides,`
` it made you feel a little discomfort, as though it was telling you that you couldn't escape from the mansion even if you tried to escape to the outside.`
`On the other hand, thanks to that, even though the violent winds could be heard, the wind itself was blocked.`
`Genji‐san held out an umbrella, but Auntie Rosa ignored him.`
`...She probably wanted to say that the gun took two hands, so taking the umbrella would be dangerous because she wouldn't be able to fire the gun.`
`Even without Genji‐san pointing his finger, we could tell immediately.`
`Right in the center of the courtyard, ......we could see where Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa‐san lay...`
`Auntie Rosa entered the courtyard without even an umbrella.`
`{n}...So Genji‐san and I also entered the courtyard without opening one.`
`{n}Only Maria had one open like normal.`
`"..................Maria...`
` ......Is this......you know?"`
`"......Uu.`
` ......It's the seventh twilight and the eighth twilight."`
`"I, ......I see.`
` Certainly, just as Genji‐san and the others said, there are horrible wounds on their necks.`
` ......Very sharp.`
` Almost as though they've been sliced with a katana or something..."`
`That gaping wound on their necks definitely made me want to avert my eyes,`
` but after seeing the Halloween party in the chapel, even though I thought it was horrible, it was no longer enough to make me feel sick.`
`Instead, our gazes were directed to their legs.`
`{n}In Doctor Nanjo's knee.`
` In Kumasawa‐san's ankle.`
`......Driven into each of them was something like a knife or a stake with a demonic decoration.`
`...They would surely be the same as the one that had pierced Jessica's back.`
`"......What is this?`
` ...It's the same as Jessica‐chan.`
` Is this supposed to be some kind of occult ritual, I wonder?"`
`".........I do not know.`
` The last time I saw their bodies, there was nothing like this.`
` Maybe it was done after they were carried out of the servant room."`
`The one that had been stuck into Doctor Nanjo's knee was still standing erect,`
` but the one that had been thrust into Kumasawa‐san's ankle might have been a little shallower.`
` It had come out and fallen over.`
`So, it was only when I saw that one that had fallen over, that for the first time, I realized that it wasn't a knife,`
` but something like a stake.`
`Its full length was probably about thirty centimeters.`
`{n}It was probably made out of bronze or iron or something of the sort.`
`Even without touching it, I could tell that it had some weight to it.`
`{n}It was composed of a grip and a cone‐shaped part, and it was obviously made to be a piercing weapon.`
`Maybe you could describe it like a miniature version of those lances Western knights used on horseback.`
`The grooves that had been carved in a spiral shape made it also look like a drill.`
`......However, the grip had an occult‐like design of a demon or something,`
` so instead of a weapon used in war,`
` it felt like something that would be used in a ritual to offer up a sacrifice.`
`"......There's no mistake.`
` ...They're meant to be...sacrifices."`
`".........On the seventh twilight, gouge the knee and kill.`
` On the eighth twilight, gouge the leg and kill."`
`"Wait.`
` Then, they've left out the fourth, fifth, and sixth twilights.`
` ......D‐......don't tell me..."`
`That's right.`
`{n}Why is Genji‐san alone?!`
`If something like this had happened, why wouldn't George‐aniki, Gohda‐san, or Shannon‐chan be here?!`
` Why was Genji‐san alone?!`
`"What is this?`
` Where did George‐kun and the other two go?!"`
`".........They told me that they wanted to go to Madam Natsuhi's room to search for something, and left.`
` They have not returned yet."`
`"What did you say...?`
` Umm, you say they left, when was that?!"`
`"Two or three hours ago, I believe."`
`"N‐no way...!!`
` Why didn't you say something that important—wait, no—why didn't you think that was suspicious?!"`
`"......There must always be one servant awaiting orders.`
` It was my duty to wait for orders until they returned."`
`Was Genji‐san really this much of a robot?!`
`This is bad, this is bad, it's really bad...!!`
`The fact that Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa‐san {i:had been killed in this way} meant that three people had already been killed...!!`
`We ran towards Aunt Natsuhi's room.`
`{n}.........With a touch of anxiety, and just as much resignation.`
`Before we even saw the inside of Aunt Natsuhi's room,`
` ...we were imprisoned by a certain resignation.`
`On that door was bizarre...`
`graffiti—`
`no, filth...?`
`In any case, the door wasn't in a normal state, and we were able to imagine what was inside that room without opening it.`
`On the face of the door...... How should I say it?`
`......Someone had heavily painted their hands with the same red paint that the magic circles from before had been drawn with,`
` ...and had banged on the door, scratched it, dirtied it.`
`......It was dirtied like the aftermath of a kindergartner playing in the mud.`
`I didn't know what it could mean.`
`{n}...The bright‐red paint that had been slathered on was dripping down, and even though no one said it, it made us think of blood.`
`"...G‐...Genji‐san, please open it."`
`Auntie Rosa held her gun up high and ordered Genji‐san to open it.`
`Genji‐san approached the door without being particularly troubled by that stuff on it, and turned the knob,`
` but he immediately turned around, shaking his head.`
`It was locked.`
`Right now, there was only one person in this mansion who could lock and unlock doors at will: Auntie Rosa.`
`This time, Genji‐san asked Auntie Rosa to unlock the door, instead of the other way around.`
`After making a slightly disgruntled face, Auntie Rosa handed me a master key, and told me to open the door.`
`"......Battler‐kun, would you open it for me with this?"`
`"Just trusting Genji‐san with something like that wouldn't..."`
`Auntie Rosa glared at me with an intense gaze.`
`{n}......Getting into a fight here would only make the environment turn even more sour.`
`Without talking back any more, I approached that creepy door, and tried the knob.`
` ......It didn't open.`
`It was definitely the resistance of the lock.`
`{n}I stuck the master key into the keyhole.`
`Clunk.`
` A light resistance.`
`While listening to Auntie Rosa as she told me to be cautious, I opened the door without being particularly cautious at all.`
`And there.........was the scene, laid out before us, not betraying our expectations in the slightest.`
`"...........................!`
` How...horrible......"`
`"....................."`
`"As I thought, ......it was a reproduction of the fourth, fifth, and sixth twilights."`
`".........Uu."`
`The inside of the room looked as though a robber had just broken in.`
`Drawers were flung open, pulled out, with their contents thrown all over the floor,`
` the room devastated so that it looked nothing like the room of the methodical Aunt Natsuhi.`
`But the thing that caught the eye before that...`
`......was Gohda‐san's body lying facedown right in front of the door...`
`One of those demon stakes had been rammed right into the center of his chest, almost as though it had been stuck there to finish off a vampire.`
`......Exactly how far would it have reached after being stuck that deeply into his chest?`
`...My own chest hurt just imagining it.`
`"...Gouge the chest was the fifth twilight?"`
`"............Uu."`
`Maria grabbed my hand.`
`......Her expression looked just like normal,`
` ...but maybe she really was afraid of the aura in this room where three bodies lay.`
`And, along the wall farthest into the room, George‐aniki was dead.`
`......This time, one of those stakes had been rammed right in the center of his stomach.`
`{n}...Gouging the stomach was the sixth twilight, I think.`
`Shannon‐chan's body was face down over the front of the dresser, lying in a sea of blood.`
`In its horribly broken mirror, sprayed with blood, had she seen her final worldly expression?`
`...Because she was face down, I couldn't see her face, but I could imagine even without seeing it.`
`Nearby, in the sea of blood she lay in, a demon's stake had fallen...`
`......Only the fourth twilight was left.`
`{n}Gouge the head and kill...`
`Maybe my heart was completely tired out and dead...`
`Even though I knew what I was doing was wrong, ...I lifted her head, and checked.`
`......And confirmed that my guess was right on the mark.`
`There was a gaping hole in Shannon‐chan's forehead, and her insides were dripping out.`
`Not only that, ...you could even see...inside her.`
`After seeing that, I finally noticed that what I was doing was wrong.`
`I immediately averted my eyes, but by now, it was probably pointless.`
`"Hey, Battler‐kun!!`
` We have to leave everything alone until the police come!!`
` What do you think you're doing, touching it?!`
` What will you do if our precious evidence from the crime scene gets disturbed?!!"`
`Auntie Rosa yelled furiously at me, and even yanked the back of my collar.`
`I tottered limply and fell on my butt, ......and gazed dimly up at the ceiling...`
`"......Maria."`
`"Uu......?"`
`"......Now even the eighth twilight is over.`
` ......What was the ninth twilight again?"`
`"...........................`
` ...On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive."`
`"I see.`
` ......So now, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} will be revived.`
` ......What then?`
` ...On the final tenth twilight?"`
`"...On the tenth twilight, the journey ends, and you shall reach the Home of the Gold.`
` .........Very soon, the door to the Golden Land will be opened.`
` ...Very soon."`
`".........The witch revives, and none shall be left alive, you say.`
` .........We're going to die?`
` Or is the sacrificial ritual over now, ...and our journey will end, and we can make it to the Golden Land...?"`
`"................................."`
`"......Our journey, yeah right.`
` ......We've spent the whole day trying to find the culprit, racking our brains as we tried to break out of this situation,`
` ...and we haven't gotten anywhere.`
` It's like they say—thinking stupid is no better than sleeping."`
`"That's right, we've spent the whole day burning ourselves up with hatred and paranoia.`
` ......We said we could only trust dead people,`
` ...and we came all the way here just to check out their dead faces...`
` ...If we're like this,`
` ......how...`
`......can you say we can make it to the Golden Land......"`
`That's right... ......If nothing could be solved, it would have been much better if we had locked ourselves up the whole time without thinking at all.`
`Grandfather was the wisest of us.`
`{n}He's been shut up in his room since yesterday, without any contact with anyone.`
`......That would have been fine.`
`{n}Grandfather was the most correct...`
`"......It'll be alright, Battler.`
` ......If you're with me, it'll be alright.`
` .........Witches are very fickle, and they're terrifying beings who maybe kill humans for fun sometimes."`
`"...But, if you're together with me, it'll definitely be alright.`
` So, don't be afraid."`
`".........Thank you.`
` ......Even if that's just to comfort me, ...it makes me happy."`
`After Auntie Rosa finished investigating their deaths, she proclaimed that she would seal this room again,`
` chased the rest of us out, stole back the master key she had lent me, and locked the door again.`
`It seemed that George‐aniki had been holding the original key to Aunt Natsuhi's room.`
` She had also collected that.`
`............Wait a second.`
`{n}She had all of the master keys in her hand.`
`And if the original key had been shut up inside that room,`
` ......wasn't this another locked room?`
`So this is a fourth locked room......?`
`Now that we had been released from our suspicion of those three, ......we once again returned to the parlor.`
`I don't have a clue what's going on anymore.`
`......If only the dead are safe, and everyone alive is a wolf,`
` ......then all that's left is me, Auntie Rosa, Maria, and Genji‐san.`
`......Only those, Grandfather, and that 19th person—the guest who I hadn't even sensed— {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`Thirteen people had died, and six were left.`
` ......With only six people, how would the wolves and sheep puzzle end...?`
` Even though the puzzle which had had nineteen people in it had been reduced to a mere six,`
` ......I couldn't find any answer...`
`We returned to the parlor.`
`......I felt a little anxious that, while we were gone,`
` a creepy magic circle or something might have been drawn on the door to the parlor,`
` but thankfully, there was none...`
`"Thank you, Genji‐san.`
` This is far enough.`
` Please rest for the day."`
`"......Certainly.`
` ...Then, if you will allow me to rest."`
`"H‐...hey, Auntie Rosa...`
` ......Are you saying that you'll leave Genji‐san all alone in a situation like this...?"`
`"......You are right.`
` I do think it's very dangerous."`
`"......But, in that case, why is he safe?`
` After those three headed to Natsuhi nee‐san's room, he was alone the whole time.`
` And yet he's safe."`
`"......It's the wolves and sheep puzzle.`
` Why would an isolated sheep—a sheep in its weakest position—be safe?"`
`"...P‐......probably because, by coincidence, there weren't any wolves..."`
`"Wrong.`
` Because it wasn't a sheep."`
`"Are you saying Genji‐san's...a wolf...?"`
`"He said that he was alone in the kitchen, but that's impossible to prove.`
` The only ones who could have carried Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa‐san's corpses, and who could have killed George and the rest, were him and {f:5:Beatrice}, right?"`
`"W‐wait, with that argument, anyone—"`
`"......Battler‐sama.`
` Thank you for your concern."`
`"...I believe that trust will be won not with a hundred excuses, but with a single unending faithfulness.`
` ......Even if I am not able to gain your trust, I wish to be faithful until the end."`
`".....................Genji‐san..."`
`"......Then it's settled.`
` ......If you are truly innocent, the police will prove that for us when they come tomorrow.`
` So, until then, we cannot remove you from suspicion."`
`".........After your long years of service to the Ushiromiya family, I find it truly painful to treat you so poorly.`
` ...But please understand for tonight.`
` ...Then, when tomorrow comes, please let me make up with you again."`
`Genji‐san gave his head a small shake.`
`"......Whether today or tomorrow,`
` I will continue to be a servant of the Ushiromiya family.`
` ......If you have any business, please say so at any time.`
` ......Then, if you will excuse me."`
`After hearing all that, there was nothing left to say.`
`{n}Genji‐san bowed deeply, and left down the hall...`
`And we entered the room.`
`...Even though Auntie Rosa still held all of the master keys herself, she began another thorough check of the inside of the parlor.`
`She opened the curtains, and checked again to make sure the windows were locked.`
`{n}As I watched, ......how should I say it, I felt like it didn't really matter anymore.`
`If I said anything unnecessary, it would turn into another fight.`
`{n}For a while, I gazed at her from the corridor, figured I had waited just about long enough, and entered the parlor behind her.`
`......If she can't trust anyone but the dead, she should just go around killing everyone with the gun she's got in her hand.`
`And then in the end, she'll realize that she herself was the wolf.`
`{n}...And then she can blast through the head of the final wolf, and the curtain will close on this insane murder theater...`
`As I thought that bitterly, I returned to the sofa where I had been encamped before,`
` and rudely rested both of my feet on the table...`
`......Or was about to, when I found something there and stopped my feet.`
`"........................`
` .........What is...this...?"`
`Right there, almost as though it was addressed to me, ...was a Western envelope.`
`It was that envelope from before, with the seal of the One‐winged Eagle.`
`{n}...And it was unopened.`
`W‐`
`.........wait wait wait wait...`
`...What is...this............?`
`When, who, put it in a place like this......?`
`I had been sitting here the whole time, until I went with everyone to check the corpses.`
`And there hadn't been anything.`
`...And when I returned,`
` it was...`
`here.`
`"......It's alright.`
` There was no problem with the locks on the windows.`
` This room is safe."`
`I heard Rosa muttering that...`
`......Wait wait wait wait.`
`{n}...Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait.`
`We had made sure this room was safe when we exited it.`
`{n}We had checked that the windows were all perfectly locked.`
`{n}...And we had locked it, come back, and the windows were still locked.`
`......Then, wait, who had put this letter here and how......`
`I opened the letter.`
`{n}Two pieces of stationery came out.`
`The first page......had a magic circle drawn on it, in something like blood.`
`If I asked Maria, she'd probably know what it meant.`
`And there was writing on the other page.`
`{e:070:― Are you making progress solving the riddle of the epitaph?`
`Very, very soon, you'll run flat out of time.`
`The ninth twilight will start very soon.}`
`......There was no mistake.`
`{n}...It was a letter...from {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`"...Uu?`
` ......Battler,`
` ......what is that?"`
`"Ah, ......right.`
` When I came here just now,`
` ...i‐it was just placed here."`
`"What happened, Maria?`
` .........Huh?!`
` Battler‐kun, that letter?!"`
`"W‐wait, err!`
` It was just placed here.`
` Why?!`
` Even though we properly checked to make sure this room was closed!!`
` Why?!`
` Why!!"`
`".................................`
` ......Maria, come here."`
`Auntie Rosa closed her eyes just a little, and after silently thinking something, told Maria to come.`
`Maria obeyed her mother's words.`
`As she did, something unbelievable happened.`
`Auntie Rosa pointed the barrel of that gun at me...`
`"Battler‐kun, I've concluded that you are a "wolf"."`
`"Wh‐.........why?!?!"`
`"When I came into the room just now, I saw that there was nothing at all on the table.`
` ...And I know that Maria did not approach that table.`
` ...It was for a short time.`
` But the only one who approached the table, and claimed to have found the letter, is you."`
`"How can you,`
` ............wait, tha‐that's all screwed up!!`
` Why would I put something like this here?!`
` Wait wait, I just found something suspicious and reported it, right?!`
` Why are you suspecting me?!"`
`"Because only you could set that letter there!!`
` That's right, this is all a charade!!`
` You pulled an envelope from your pocket, and then acted as though you had just found it.`
` To create the illusion that the witch entered a locked room, set down a letter, and left!!"`
`"...............You dumbass...`
` Are you thinking like that a‐......again...?`
` Because of something like that,`
` ......you're going to suspect me?!"`
`"Cut that out!!`
` My family has been killed!!`
` Why would {i:I} of all people take part in the culprit's scheme?!!"`
`"Yes.`
` Even under the assumption you could receive a large amount of money, I don't want to believe a demon exists who would sell their own parents."`
`"But, ...maybe he does.`
` No, that's a bad way to say it.`
` ......What if, in your eyes, Battler‐kun, Rudolf nii‐san and Kyrie‐san weren't your parents?"`
`"...Wh‐......whaaa?!?!`
` Think about what you're saying!!"`
`"Dad is Dad!!`
` Sure I'm not related to Kyrie‐san by blood, but she's like a big sister to me!!`
` Don't you dare say otherwise, you bastard!!"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Stoooppp iiiiit!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Stop saying "uu‐uu"!!"`
`"......I'm sorry, that was a bad way to say it.`
` Of course, Ushiromiya Battler‐kun might be Rudolf nii‐san's child!"`
`"......But, are you really Battler‐kun, the son of Rudolf nii‐san?!"`
`"What the hell are you talking about?!!`
` If I'm not Battler, then who else do I look like?!"`
`"All of us, including Rudolf nii‐san, reunited with you after a six‐year gap.`
` No one can prove that you really are Ushiromiya Battler, right?!"`
`"Maybe you aren't really Ushiromiya Battler, but someone who's snuck in, trying to skillfully steal the wealth of the Ushiromiya family!!`
` Can you clearly prove that you are Ushiromiya Battler?!`
` Right here, right now!!!"`
`"Cut it out, damn it!!`
` I am me!`
` Ushiromiya Battler!!`
` If we're going to doubt even that much, are you really Ushiromiya Rosa?!`
` I'm myself, no one else!!`
` Yeah, that's right, it's just as you say, the only one you can trust other than corpses is yourself!!!"`
`"If you're going to say that much, it's time I argued back!"`
`"The door to Aunt Natsuhi's room, where George‐aniki and the others died, was locked!`
` George‐aniki was holding the key to that room, right?!`
` And by now, the only one holding a master key is you!`
` Weren't you the only one who could have locked that room?!?!"`
`"My reasoning goes like this.`
` You're in contact with the real culprit,`
` and while I wasn't looking, you lent them one of the five master keys!!"`
`"I wouldn't do that!!`
` See, there are five of them here, right?!"`
`"As if that matters!!`
` You could have had them set it in a pre‐arranged spot and then collected it back!!`
` And weren't you the one who said it was suspicious whether there really are five master keys?!"`
`"So how are you saying that someone other than yourself set that letter there?!!`
` {i:As long as you can't prove that}, you are a wolf!!"`
`"Shut uuuuuup!!`
` Then why don't you show me some proof,`
` how do you say the culprit killed George‐aniki and the rest in that locked room?!`
` How did they lock it?!!"`
`"Absolutely and totally correct!`
` {p:1:Natsuhi's room was exactly the same, just like usual}!`
` {p:1:The door and the windows were locked from the inside}."`
`"{p:1:There were no frauds or tricks, no means of secret passage nor places in which to hide}!`
` {p:1:Natsuhi's own key was in George's pocket, and locked inside the room}.`
` {p:1:That leaves only the five master keys, and "Rosa" was holding all of them}!"`
`"{p:1:And while I'm at it, the parlor is the same}.`
` {p:1:The key to the parlor itself is sealed away in the servant room}.`
` {p:1:So unlocking it with anything but a master key is impossible}! {p:1:The locked‐room definition of the room is the same as always}!"`
`"Come onnnnn, there's only one suspect noooooooooow,`
` or are you still playing dumb, Ushiromiya Battleeee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeeer?!"`
`"Shut uuuuuuup!!`
` You keep silent as wellll{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}llllll!!!"`
`"You're the one who should keep silent, how do you say that letter was set there by someone other than you?!`
` As long as you can't prove that, you're a wolf!!"`
`"If I can be suspected, then you can be suspected, you try showing me some proof,`
` weren't you the first to enter the room and begin checking the windows?!"`
`"Then you anticipated that I'd return to where I'd been sitting before, and secretly placed the letter.`
` I can also suspect that this is your trap, can't I?!"`
`"Why would I use a trap like that?!!`
` If I was a wolf, I'd shoot you with this gun without question!!"`
`"That's no reason!!`
` Maybe, because you couldn't commit murder in front of Maria, you chose the roundabout way of setting a clever trap!!"`
`"All of the master keys are in your hands!`
` So this place and the room just a while ago, are all your doing, aren't they?!!`
` If you can talk your way out of this, then let me hear your excuse!!"`
`"That's right, you've been suspicious from the start!`
` Why is it that six of the adults in the family conference were killed, and you were the only exception?`
` Why were you the only one not in that chapel?!"`
`"There can only be one reason, you called Dad and the rest out there and killed them!!`
` Damn it, damn it,`
` that explains everything, doesn't it, don't fuck with me don't fuck with me,`
` stop saying things that don't make seeee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeense!!"`
`"Uuuuu!!`
` Stooppppp iiiiiiiiit!!`
` You mustn't fiiiight!!"`
`"Mama too, Battler too, stop iiiiiiiiiiit, stop iiiiiiiiiiiiit!!!`
` It's no one's fault!`
` It's not Battler's or Mama's fault!!`
` The witch did all of this!`
` She did it with magic!!`
` It's no one's faaaaaaaaaault!!`
` Uu‐uuuu!!"`
`Maria thrust herself in between me and Auntie Rosa, both of us incensed.`
`I was taken aback by Maria's crying voice and returned to my senses.`
`{n}...At that instant, I became filled with shame.`
`{n}Tears flowed from my eyes.`
`"......That's right...`
` ......It's all...`
`......the witch's fault, isn't it......!!`
` All this about keys and tricks and alibis......`
`all of it, all of it was stupid!!"`
`"Even though it's the work of the witch, we weren't even able to trust each other as fellow humans...!!`
` Right, Auntie Rosa? From the beginning, there wasn't a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} culprit, it was all the work of the witch."`
`"So there's no way you're the culprit,`
` and there's no way I'm the culprit, or Maria, or Genji‐san, or aaaaaanyone!!`
` Why has it come to this?!!"`
`"Why am I screaming with Auntie Rosa, ......who I loved?!`
` Why am I having this fight...`
`...with the kind aunt who I loved?!"`
`"Why, why does everyone have to suspect each other?!?!`
` I'm not going to doubt my auntie, I'm not going to doubt anyone,`
` it's all the work of the witch, it's all the work of {f:5:Beatrice},`
` it's all, all a crime that {f:5:Beatrice} committed with magic!!"`
`"{f:5:Beatriceeeeee}, please, show yourself here,`
` and confess to us that you did everything,`
` I've had enough already, I've had enough of doubting each other like this!!"`
`"So forgive us,`
` release us,`
` release us from this hell of suspecting each other until we see each other's deaths!!`
` Give me my kind relatives and cousins back!!`
` I hate it, I hate it, I hate it all!!`
` You definitely exist, you win!!"`
`"Show yourself, ooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oooohhh, {f:5:Beatriceeee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeeeee}!`
` {f:5:Beatriiiiiceee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eee}!!!"`
`".........Am I...............still...alive?"`
`Kinzo seemed to have fallen into a doze at some point.`
`He searched for his spectacles, and looked at the clock.`
`{n}......It was 10 p.m.`
`"...Her ritual, I wonder, how far has it progressed?`
` ............It must have progressed quite far by this time."`
`Kinzo lifted his heavy body from the chair, ......and approached the portrait of the witch that he had gazed at every day.`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Very soon, ......I will be able to be reunited with your smile.`
` ............It doesn't matter if I die!`
` If I could just see your smile once more, I would gladly give this life of mine!"`
`"So,`
` ...I beg youuuu, let me...`
`...meet with you one more tiiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiiiime...`
` And let me swear my love to you, let me apologize for my crimes, uuuoooooooooooo......"`
`"......But I won't let you escape!!`
` You are mine!!`
` From your hair to the tips of your toes, to the dirt under your nails, you are mine!!`
` Every fragment of your flesh is mine, even the broth of your corpse is mine!!"`
`"I won't let you escape, this time you won't spill from my hands!!`
` I'll make you mine for all eternity!!!`
` I will never let you escape a second time,`
` I will never let you escape a second time!!"`
`Kinzo howled in rage, then suddenly fell to his knees, ...as he shook and scraped at the wall...`
` ...In an instant, he had started sobbing.`
`"............uuuuuu, hic...,`
` that's wrong,`
` that's not what I wanted to sayyy, {f:5:Beatriceeeeee}..."`
`"Please,`
` ......let me meet you one more time...`
` Even if you only let me apologize......`
` Uuuuuuuuu, {f:5:Beatriceeeeee},`
` ...hic, ...hic...! Uwaaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}u{0}a{0}a{0}uauau...!!"`
`"You are beloved, yearned for...! I was wrong...!`
` If you would just smile, I wouldn't need anything else...`
` I made a mistake, I got it wrong,`
` ......I did something that cannot be taken back...!"`
`"In atonement, I have offered the whole remainder of my life...!!`
` In order to apologize to you, in order to atone for my sins,`
` .........I have...`
`...offered everything.........`
` ......Please, even if it is as I die..."`
`"............At least...`
`............let me...`
`say one word...`
`...of apology...y......`
` {f:5:Beatriceeeeeee}......`
` Uuuuuu, hic, uuuuuuuu, uuuuuuuuuuuuu!"`
`......As Kinzo shook and cried, behind his small back, a butterfly appeared out of nowhere, like a flake of gold leaf, and softly fell down...`
`...You fool, Kinzo.`
`{n}Do you think a woman exists who would fall for a man's tears.........?`
`Well, ......even if it wouldn't make a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} woman fall for you, ...it might for a woman who is not {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
`Kinzo.`
` Do you remember......?`
`{n}The board position of our chess game, which we never finished......?`
`Kinzo, as though he had suddenly remembered something, approached the chess set.`
` The game he had been playing with Nanjo until yesterday remained there still.`
`...He wiped the pieces from the chessboard with a wide sweeping motion, and began to line them up again one by one.`
` ...It was the setup for a game in progress.`
`".........That's right. Like this.`
` ............I advanced my queen.`
` ...That was a very spectacular move.`
` It might have been a little too intense for you.`
` .........I deliberated whether you would throw away your piece or not,`
` ......deliberated and deliberated............"`
`Kinzo waited, with the opposite seat empty.`
`......Surely, very soon, his opponent would appear there,`
` ......and he would be able to restart this game again...`
`...You fool, Kinzo.`
`You want to apologize?`
` You want to see my face again?`
` You want to make my smile an eternal thing?`
`Why can't you say a much, much simpler word?`
` Even though that is the single element of the world.........`
`At that time, Kinzo muttered.`
`{n}......A prayer?`
` An entreaty?`
`{n}.........It was probably best to just call it muttering.`
`"......I.........love you...`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice}..............."`
`They were pure words, like something an innocent child would say, without any evil intent...`
`...You really are a fool, Kinzo.`
`If you ever have the chance to do your life over again...`
`{n}...know that those words could never cause a woman to fall for you.`
`Yes, ...not without a miracle.`
`{n}So this.........`
`Just then.`
` .........Kinzo definitely heard a small knock, with a different tempo than those of the servants.........`
`".........Who is it?"`
`The woman beyond the door......didn't answer.`
`"......I'm asking who you are!!`
` Will you not answer?!!"`
`The woman beyond the door...`
`...didn't answer.`
`"Could it be...`
` ............Oooooh,`
` ......could it be......`
` B‐`
`......{f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice},`
` .........{f:5:Beatriceeeeeeeee}!!"`
`The woman beyond the door......answered.`
`On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive.`
`Battler could be found in the dining hall.`
`Unable to summon the will to return to the guesthouse in the middle of this rain,`
` he had wandered halfheartedly around the mansion in search of a random place to sit, ...and had stationed himself in the dining hall.`
`He hadn't bothered to lock it.`
`He did think that maybe the shapeless murderer, or the Golden Witch, might come to kill him now that he was isolated,`
` but he no longer thought about resisting that.`
`On the contrary, he had no intention of blocking the culprit with a lock.`
`{n}He wanted that person to come at him openly, from the front.`
`...If it was a murderer, he thought he'd ask them to tell about some of those wonderful locked room tricks as a parting souvenir.`
`And if it was a witch, he thought he'd ask her to at least take his life with some wonderful magic.`
`......However, ironically, neither of these two came to meet Battler...`
`Battler opened the liquor cabinet on his own and enjoyed the liquor to his heart's content.`
`{n}No longer was there anybody anywhere who would have a problem with him drinking alcohol.`
`He boldly set both of his legs on the extravagant tablecloth and savored the high‐quality liquor, which probably had a mind‐boggling price, straight from the neck of the bottle....`
`At that time, ......someone knocked.`
`Battler realized that he was about to meet his maker...`
`"Heee~yy, it's not locked.`
` Come in, whoever you are.`
` And please introduce yourself.`
` If you're human, gimme your name.`
` And if you're {f:5:Beatrice}, gimme your three sizes."`
`"You might not believe this, but I'm a pretty well‐known breast‐sommelier, y'sheee?"`
`".........It is Genji, Battler‐sama."`
`"...Genji‐san, huh.`
` ......Sorry, but I'm not interested in your bust size.`
` Please, come in. It's open."`
`".........Excuse me."`
`Genji‐san opened the door and bowed.`
`.........So Genji‐san was the culprit after all, ...or maybe an accomplice?`
` ......That theory would probably explain most of the tricks...`
`"Did you come to give me my last rites?"`
`".........Nothing of the sort.`
` ......I shall excuse myself if I am disturbing you."`
`"...Wait, wait, excusing yourself without even telling me what you wanted would actually just be creepy.`
` ...What do you want?`
` ...Please, let me do as I wish, at least in the very end."`
`".........Battler‐sama, is it truly your wish...`
`to spend the little time you have left in such an indolent fashion?"`
`Those words...stung...`
`{n}......Of course it wasn't.`
`"...............................`
` What can I do at this point?`
` ......I'm ready to die at any time..."`
`"......You are just like the Master.`
` Indeed, you inherited the Master's blood strongly...."`
`"You mean to tell me that Grandfather, that larger‐than‐life man, was actually willing to die at any moment...?`
` First I've heard of that."`
`".........The Master's life,`
` ......after a number of sad incidents,`
` ......was completely reduced to atonement."`
`"...What do you know?"`
`"............{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's ritual has been entirely completed up to the eighth twilight.`
` ...I believe...that I can now tell you everything."`
`"Wha‐......what did you say...?"`
`My drunkenness was completely blown away.`
` I lowered my feet from the table and listened carefully to hear what kind of words Genji‐san would say next...`
`"Battler‐sama.`
` ......I shall guide you to the Master's study.`
` ......It would probably be better to hear it directly from them."`
`"From......them...?`
` H‐hey, what in the world do you mean by that...!!"`
`"......Come, this way.`
` I shall guide you.`
` Battler‐sama."`
`After Genji‐san told me to follow him, he started to walk down the corridor.`
`I sobered up completely and went after him...`
`We climbed the big staircase, .........towards the third floor.`
`{n}Genji‐san stopped walking halfway.`
`{n}He then turned back and spoke.`
`".........Battler‐sama.`
` ......From here on, you will...`
`......probably see things you will not be able to understand."`
`"Don't try to intimidate me.`
` .........I've already seen plenty of things I can't understand today."`
`".........Please accept what you see as you see it,`
` and what you hear as you hear it."`
`"Questions like "Why?",`
` or "What?",`
` ...there is no need for such things.`
` ...Battler‐sama, you will probably simply learn the truth.`
` Whether to accept it, believe it,`
` or even deny it, are all choices I leave to you."`
`"....................................."`
`Genji‐san checked one last time to see whether I was prepared to learn the truth.`
`The eighth twilight had already ended.`
` And on the ninth twilight, the witch revives, ......and none shall be left alive.`
`It meant that {f:5:Beatrice} had already revived.`
`{n}...And probably, none of us would be allowed to return alive.`
`If I was going lose my life anyway, ......I wanted to know the truth in the end.`
`{n}...It didn't matter how hard it might be to accept.`
`"..................Yeah.`
` ......Even if a demon or a witch shows up, ...I'm prepared."`
`".........You really are just like the Master in his youth.`
` ......Battler‐sama, please be diligent in your studies.`
` In the future, you will surely have great aspirations.`
` And make sure that at that time, you are not forced into a lifetime of regret by a lack of academic knowledge."`
`".........If I have a chance to work hard in my studies, then no problem."`
`".............................."`
`Genji‐san's silence forced me to consider that resignation of mine more deeply...`
`And, .........we could see the door of Grandfather's study, impregnated with a sweet smell.`
`From his pocket, Genji‐san withdrew a gold key with an elegant design.`
`The master keys had been confiscated by Auntie Rosa, but the key to this study alone, he had kept with him.`
`He put it in the keyhole, .........and it made a heavy clunking sound.`
`".........My lord.`
` It is Genji.`
` I have brought Battler‐sama with me."`
`There was no reply, but it seemed that permission to go in had been given...`
`"Come, Battler‐sama.`
` ......Please enter."`
`"..................Yeah.`
` ......In I go."`
`I readied myself, ......and threw the door open...`
`At that moment, ...I got slightly disoriented by the dazzling golden glow..........`
`It was, .........somehow,`
` ......a swarm of butterflies, shining gold.`
`The golden butterflies that were completely filling the inside of the study poured out all at once.......`
`"Wha‐............`
` ......What the heck...`
`......is thiiiss.................."`
`It was almost like golden leaf confetti.`
`{n}The interior of Grandfather's study was filled with a golden glow...`
`And......there were reception sofas and a table for guests placed in front of the study desk,`
` .........and I could see Grandfather's back.`
`There was someone on the side opposite from Grandfather.`
`{n}...It was in shadow, so I couldn't see it well...`
`"......My lord.`
` I have brought Battler‐sama."`
`"............Battler, is it?`
` I'm busy thinking now...`
` Be silent for a while......"`
`Kinzo declared that in displeasure, his back still turned.`
`It seemed that he was enjoying playing chess with a visitor...`
`Apparently, the opponent had counterattacked with a superb move.`
`{n}Kinzo seemed to be enjoying himself as he thought deeply, while occasionally laughing and groaning...`
`"I thought for thirty years.`
` ......I thought for thirty years about how to counterattack this move...`
` Have fun, have fun with the move I fermented for thirty years."`
`"......Heheheheheheheh.`
` Indeed, this is a deeply matured move.`
` ......Such fun, such fun... *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, hahahahahahaha...!!`
` Unbeatable, unbeatable."`
`"......Wha‐`
`............what is...`
`......this........."`
`"So you came, Battler.`
` Wait just a moment.`
` Be silent for Kinzo's sake.`
` ...Isn't it too early to resign, Kinzo?`
` I can already counterattack for several moves.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`It should have been...`
`...my first meeting with that witch.`
`However, ...I knew this witch.`
`{n}Even though it was our first meeting,`
` ...I knew her,`
` ......from the portrait......!`
`"Genji.`
` Serve something for Battler.`
` What would be the most appropriate for this man...?"`
`"......The same which the Master has loved since the days of his youth."`
`"That is ideal; serve it to him.`
` ......You did well coming here, Ushiromiya Battler.`
` First, take a seat."`
`".........You called my name many times, did you not?`
` In deference to that, I allowed you to meet me.`
` ...So, what will you ask me?`
` What will you inquire?"`
`"......The door to the Golden Land will soon be opened.`
` Soon, we will have a banquet to celebrate my revival, to which I will be welcoming the witches.`
` ...In the meantime, I'll be answering your questions, as many as you like."`
`"I, ......I have a bunch of things I want to ask about!!`
` What happened on this island?!`
` And why did these incidents happen?!"`
`"I want to ask about the locked rooms too!!`
` What about the chapel?!`
` What about Jessica's room?!`
` And the servant room?!`
` And Aunt Natsuhi's room?!`
` And the parlor?!"`
`"There's more still I want to ask about!!`
` About the witch's true nature!!`
` Are you really a witch?!!`
` What is your purpose, what do you want to make us do and why did you call me here?!!`
` Answer me, about everything!!!"`
`"Arrrrghhh, be quiet!!`
` You think merely asking will get you answers?!?!"`
`"Don't say that, Kinzo.`
` A fragile and fleeting spider web did protect from King Herod once.`
` ......Just as there are no useless things in this world, there are also no useless questions."`
`"Very well, I'll answer all your questions.`
` ......But, I do have one condition."`
`"What is it?"`
`"Once you have heard everything, if you are satisfied of my existence,`
` ............kneel, and kiss my shoes.`
` I called you here because I wanted to make you submit to me."`
`"...Kinzo and I made a bet.`
` We bet on which would come first, Kinzo thinking of a new move, or me forcing you to submit.`
` I don't see myself losing.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"...D‐............Damn you, talking so tough!!`
` Yeah, alright.`
` Try to make me admit it.`
` ...Try to make me admit that you're a witch and that you can use weird, awesome, and great magic!!"`
`"If I submit, I'll kiss your shoes or do whatever else you want!!!"`
`The witch cackled gloatingly.`
`{n}Then, she glared at him unpleasantly with eyes that said a man can't go back on his word...`
`"Well said!!`
` So, from what question shall I begin?!`
` I'll answer everything!!`
` Come, what will the first one be?!?!"`
`"Where are you, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` Show yourself!!`
` {f:5:Beatriceee}!!"`
`Rosa finally arrived at the chapel.`
` She pointed her gun around her, screaming the witch's name, but there was no way there would be an answer.`
`After grimacing slightly, she noisily approached the table where her siblings' corpses were still exposed, and stretched out her arm towards the gold ingots.`
`They were very heavy, but Rosa paid that no regard.`
`{n}She wrapped one of them up in a blanket, and slung it over her shoulder.`
`"At least...just this one......`
` Just this should be worth more than ten million..."`
`Rosa did not part with her gun either, carrying the gold in addition to it.`
`{n}...Her shoulders were screaming, but Rosa didn't care.`
`"......Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` It will happen very soon.`
` ......Very soon, the door to the Golden Land...will open."`
`"Stop laughing with that creepy voice!!`
` Where is {f:5:Beatrice}?!`
` Yes, I know it, she's around here somewhere, isn't she?!`
` You know, right?!`
` Where?!"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` I dooon't knowww.`
` Even if you don't search for her, you can meet her in the Golden Land.`
` ...Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi,`
` ouch."`
`"Stop that laugh!!`
` ......Aaah, it almost makes {i:me} want to laugh!!`
` That's right, that was definitely a witch, definitely a witch!!`
` I didn't understand, I thought it was a human calling herself a witch, I was wrong!!!"`
`"...It really was a witch!!`
` I won't be fooled by a thing like that!!`
` You're there, aren't you?!`
` Come out, show yourself!!`
` {f:5:Beatriceeee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeeee}!!!"`
`"I told you, she'll appear very soon.`
` The door to the Golden Land will be opened.`
` ......Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi..."`
`"............Of course.`
` That's what I should have done!`
` I don't care, I shall throw away the rook!`
` You, woman, are the king, who can't even be reached without the resolve to lose everything one has.`
` I'll corner you, {f:5:Beatriceeee}.`
` Hihahahahahahahahahaha!"`
`"At least call me a queen.`
` Hoh, what a brilliant move.`
` Tenacity is in your, ...no, in the Ushiromiyas' blood."`
`"......How pleasant!`
` Truly an elegant night.`
` Ku‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha...!!"`
`".........My lord; {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` It will soon be time for the banquet."`
`"Already?`
` ......That's fast.`
` Every night I pass with you goes by fast;`
` the moon falls like an apple, and the sun rises like a small fish leaping out of the river."`
`"Shall we go, it is time.`
` ......Stand, Battler.`
` It is the beginning of the banquet to celebrate my revival."`
`"I'll introduce you as my new furniture, ...no, as my toy.`
` To the dignitaries among witches."`
`The witch was relaxing elegantly, her feet thrown out from the sofa and sitting on top of a footrest.`
`...However, the footrest wasn't a part of the sofa, ......it was a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` Which was down on all fours......`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, your silk dress."`
`"You are the guest of honor, but I am the host.`
` I will go out first.`
` It would have been nice if Shannon were here to help dress you, but, unfortunately, it seems that she no longer remains."`
`"......She's never around when I want to use her.`
` Completely useless.`
` .........However, you did well to remain here.`
` ...I'm happy, my friend."`
`"......I am grateful for your words."`
`"Good.`
` Wait downstairs, you two.`
` Genji, good work, set the dress down over there."`
`"......Certainly.`
` .........Well then, my lord."`
`"We will go first.`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice}, I will see you later."`
`"Indeed."`
`Kinzo and Genji left the study.`
`{n}After that, only the witch and the dress and the furniture remained.`
`".........Do you know why I am not embarrassed to show myself to you naked...?"`
`"..........................."`
`"It's because you are furniture.`
` Furrrrniture.`
` Understand?`
` Furniture, just furrrrniture!"`
`"Who would feel shame at exposing their body to furniture?`
` So there is no reason for me to feel shame because of you.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The witch stood up, and removed her jacket just at the shoulders.`
`{n}......The jacket slumped down at the back.`
`When the furniture respectfully approached to pick up her clothing, the witch gave it a small kick and it fell over.`
`...The furniture was afraid of what misconduct it had shown...`
`"Do you, as furniture, plan to force me to unbutton myself?"`
`"......Stand.`
` And undo the buttons.`
` ...One by one, carefully.`
` Quickly.`
` Beautifully.`
` With no mistakes.`
` The guests are being kept waiting, change my clothes quickly."`
`"..................Yes..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, kakakaka, hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!!`
` Undo them carefully.`
` Those buttons are each worth more than one of your eyeballs.`
` ...If you accidentally tear one off, I'll sew on an eyeball of yours in its place...`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`The entrance hall was bustling with a large number of figures.`
`{n}And it was sparkling gold with the gold butterflies flying around.`
`The gentlemen in suits and tuxedos and the ladies in dresses looked like they were having a great number of friendly chats.`
` At a glance, it might have looked like a fabulous medieval ball.`
`But they all had one thing in common, and that thing was exceedingly bizarre.`
`......Because all of them...had goat heads.`
`It was impossible to tell whether it was a goat mask masquerade,`
` .........or whether they really had goat heads.`
`...The latter was a ridiculous notion, but in this bizarre world, there was serious doubt about which was true...`
`Kinzo was amongst those goat nobles, greeting them.`
`Every one of them seemed to be an honored guest, and Kinzo greeted them more respectfully than could ever have been imagined from his normal demeanor.`
`At that time, Genji's voice rang out through the hall.`
`{n}It was a voice calling for silence.`
`{n}That voice stopped the voices of idle chatter, and everyone turned to face Genji.`
`".........Tonight marks the entrance of our Golden Witch, who has achieved her revival,`
` the Lady {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I ask you all to join me in welcoming her with your applause."`
`When Genji began to applaud, it quickly spread through the guests, and became thunderous applause.`
`And.........the Golden Witch appeared at the top of the large staircase...`
`She gracefully waved her hand as she slowly descended the staircase...with her preferred furniture in tow...`
`The goat nobles offered unanimous words of celebration in some long‐forgotten language.`
`And those with whom she was closely acquainted embraced her, filled with joy at their reunion.`
`As the witch offered greetings of reunion, ...the witch's furniture followed behind her the whole time.`
`.........There was a chain around its neck.`
`{n}This was gripped in the witch's hand, like it was a trained dog.`
`The chain wasn't there to restrain it.`
`{n}...The only purpose of the restraining device was to injure the furniture's dignity...`
`It wasn't permitted to wear anything else on its body.`
`One of the young woman goats, mixed in with the goat nobles,`
` softly removed her goat mask as the furniture passed in front of her, and spoke with eyes that had no light in them.`
`That face...looked like it belonged to a long‐haired young girl...`
`"...............How pitiful."`
`"Ohh, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` Welcome.`
` Do you like my furniture?"`
`".........Good taste."`
`After saying only that, the witch called {f:5:Bernkastel} once again put on her goat mask,`
` and was swallowed up in the shadows of the other tall goats...`
`"Ahahahahahahaha...`
` Sore loser.`
` She's irritated."`
`"You're right.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The young women goats giggled, and the witch once again let out a high‐pitched laugh.`
`"Thank you for gathering here for my sake tonight!!`
` Why don't we enjoy to the fullest this "banquet of the witch", where old friends have gathered from past and present, east and west...!"`
`"Come, we will eat all night,`
` drink all night,`
` slurp all night,`
` and chew to bits all night as we enjoy ourselves!!`
` Look at the clock, it shows the time when the ending hour and the beginning hour melt together... ...Come!!`
` Let us begin the banquet of the witch!!!"`
`When the witch proclaimed the beginning of the banquet, the large clock pointed to 24:00, and the sound of a bell began to ring out loudly...`
`"Come...... Now is the time!!`
` Open the golden door............!!!"`
`All at once, the butterflies leafed in gold flew all around the inside of the room.`
`Amidst the golden storm and the brilliant gold‐colored light, the cross‐section joining this world and a different world......was cut open......`
`Amidst the goats' delighted voices, the mansion of the human world and the mansion of those not human overlapped,`
` ......and, in the form of golden butterflies, all those folk who praised the resurrection of the Golden Witch...`
`...poured out of the depths of hell...`
`It was...a golden...tornado.`
`{n}...A rondo of golden demons.`
`Come, tonight we will put aside rank.`
`Throw open the wine cellar,`
` drop the snake's head into the liquor pot,`
` throw cows and chickens into the furnace alive,`
` drink and eat and sing and dance,`
` sneer and kill and desecrate and degrade!!`
`"Aaaaaahh, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` Take me to the Golden Land now!`
` To the Golden Laaaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaaand!!!`
` Oooo{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}ooohhh{0}h{0}hhhhh, aaaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaaahhh!!!"`
`The goat nobles were suddenly crushing in around Kinzo.`
`...Almost like they were kids demanding the autograph of some famous movie star.`
`There were two differences.`
` First, they were witches, not kids.`
` And second, what the witches demanded were not autographs.`
`Kinzo began to drown in the sea of goat nobles.`
`{n}Only Kinzo's laughing voice echoed throughout the area.`
`It was a grand mixture of laughter and his death throes.`
`{n}And Kinzo became wine and meat and bread.`
`An aroma if slurped, a rich taste if gnawed, and pleasant to tear to bits!`
`The voice of his death throes lingered on sweetly,`
` and adorned with melted chocolate and silver dragées, it would make a wonderful dessert!`
`If you took the bones home, you could also use them for a soup,`
` and the remains could even become toys for the children to play with,`
` and they could also become good tools for fortune‐telling that always gave misfortune!`
`That entire scene, ......was watched by the piece of furniture.`
`{n}It was all fantastical.`
` ...It was all demonic.`
`...Was the quaking of its heart, which should have been paralyzed, ...proof that it could still feel fear?`
`Just then, its knees buckled, and the furniture's body tumbled onto the center of the carpet.`
`Because the witch had kicked those knees from behind.`
`"Kneel and show your respect.`
` Rub your forehead against the carpet and show how vulgar you are.`
` Join your hands behind your back and swear that you will offer all your flesh and blood to me."`
`"..................u............ah........."`
`The piece of furniture let out a painful voice.`
`...Fear is the most primal emotion {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s have.`
`{n}...Was that emotion reviving his sense of self, which should already have been killed?`
`".........Hmph.`
` So, you are still far from being appropriate for my furniture."`
`"Good!`
` I will carefully make you into the kind of furniture I like, the kind appropriate only for me.`
` ...I suppose the best you can do for now is simply entertaining the guests!"`
`The goat nobles were surrounding the cowering furniture...`
`{n}It seemed that their blazing, blood‐red eyes couldn't hide their ecstasy at this new young food that they had been given.`
`And from their mouths, from which protruded countless ugly teeth, saliva,`
` ...or maybe the traces of meat and wine that they had just eaten, dribbled down...`
`".........e............eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!!"`
`As the piece of furniture let out a wild scream, it retreated, still sitting on its backside.`
`...But the circle of goat nobles was closing in...`
`And the piece of furniture looked at the witch's face.`
` ...It stared at her face one final time, believing that because it had submitted to the witch, she would show it some mercy.`
`But there was nothing but scorn on the witch's face, and she wasn't even facing it anymore.`
`The witch went off to greet an honored guest with whom she had crossed gazes...`
`The goat nobles looked down upon the furniture.`
`They were, in fact, waiting.`
`Just like how one must remove the cork in order to drink champagne,`
` before bringing the offering served at the banquet to their mouths, they were waiting for just one of {i:those}.`
`Of course, the furniture didn't know what that was.`
`...But it would come out of his mouth all by itself.`
` In the same way there is always a pop when the cork is removed, it too would certainly leave his mouth.`
`"...G...`
`......yaa...`
`ahiiii{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}iiIII!!!"`
`{nobreak:{m:-5:—}—}A scream.`
`{n}It was a sign that the modest banquet at which he was to be served...had begun.`
`"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`
`gebu{0}ki{0}kya{0}kya{0}ka{0}ku`
`oooo{0}ga{0}a{0}ge{0}o{0}e`
`oo{0}ooaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a`

`Gapupogyugukigukiboryu.`
`By now the rose garden was a garden of roses and gold.`
` A gold‐colored garden where gold butterflies, gold fairies, gold lizards rampaged and flew about wildly.`
`"Maria, hurry!!`
` Run!!`
` Hurry hurry hurry hurry!!"`
`Holding onto the gun and the blanket wrapping the ingot,`
` Rosa ran at a speed Maria couldn't catch up with, sometimes pausing to call out at Maria to run faster.`
`Therefore, she saw it every time.`
`{n}...She saw the golden pursuers chasing them from the mansion!`
`The mass of gold butterflies was chasing after them like a massive crawling hand!!`
` And horrifyingly strange‐looking shadowy figures with goat heads were chasing after them...!!`
`There was no need for her to strain her eyes.`
` Because those blazing pupils told her what would happen if she was captured.`
`"......Mama, wait,`
` Mama, wait......`
` ...Uu‐uu,`
` ......au!!"`
`Maria tripped over.`
`Rosa, ashamed that for just an instant she had entertained thoughts of abandoning her daughter and running away, kicked back against the ground and instantly reversed direction.`
`As Rosa's own child tried to stand,`
` the goat‐head that had sprinted over to get the first bite grabbed a fistful of her hair and pulled her up from the back...!!`
`"Mamaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,`
` noooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooooo!!"`
`Rosa rammed into the goat‐head with her shoulder,`
` spun,`
` bashed the back of her elbow into the goat's jaw,`
` and buried her knee into its protruding chest!!`
`And she thrust the barrel of the gun inside the goat‐head's mouth as it doubled over from the pain in its gut!`
`"......Just try laying one finger on Maria in front of me.`
` I'll show you just how lukewarm the hell you came from is."`
`The blast from the 45‐caliber Long Colt bullet exploded inside the goat‐head's throat,`
` and its medulla oblongata was instantly pulverized.`
`The goat‐head couldn't understand.`
`It had thought that women were like already opened wine bottles!`
`{n}It had thought that they were wine bottles, and that turning them upside down would immediately cause their deep‐red contents to come out!`
`"Mama!!`
` Mamaaaaaa!!"`
`Released, Maria flung her arms around Rosa.`
`But the pursuers were still coming!`
` They could see the giant goat‐heads, who had given up even pretending to be {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, running towards them from across the rose bushes.`
`Rosa spilled several extra bullets, which had been in the pocket of her coat, all over the place, and told Maria to pick them up.`
`"Y‐yes...!`
` Pick up, pick up...!!"`
`"Maria.`
` If Mama falls down,`
` run.`
` Go to the shore.`
` And swim, and swim, and swim!`
` There's no place on this island where we can survive!!"`
`"N‐no!!`
` Together with Mama!!`
` Uuu!!"`
`Rosa's gun roared four times.`
` But even though she really did land four shots in the chest of the massive, approaching goat, it didn't even flinch!!`
`The goat ran with a violent vigor, as though it planned to crush Rosa and Maria with its massive body!!`
`"Put the bullets in!!`
` Quickly!!"`
`"U‐uu!!"`
`Rosa grasped the blanket with the ingot in both hands,`
` and she herself sprinted at the goat, dragging the ingot along behind her!!`
` Without even an ounce of fear of that strange‐looking giant!!`
`If it's to protect my daughter, I'll overcome even hell!!`
`"I'll show you...`
`what a golden dream looks liiiiiiiiiiike!!!"`
`Rosa's roar.`
` The goat‐head's roar.`
`The terribly heavy ingot, after picking up a terrible centrifugal force and speed, slammed into the goat‐head's cranium.`
`Rosa pulled a fountain pen from her pocket.`
` But she held it crooked.`
` She placed it in her palm,`
` in the gap between her middle finger and her ring finger, so that it stuck out when she made a fist, almost like it was a stinger growing out.`
`She jabbed that stinger into the left eye of the goat‐head as its head toppled forward.`
` Was the goat‐head's roar a scream?`
`But Rosa's roar was different.`
`She pulled back her fist and slammed it into the fountain pen that was still sticking into the goat‐head's eye.`
` The pointed tip was gouged destructively into the depths of its head...!`
`"Mama, bullets in!!"`
`"Good job!!"`
`As I grabbed the gun Maria had thrown, I finally heard the thunderous crash of the giant tumbling to earth.`
`However, at the same time, I saw the goat‐head pursuers on the other side of the rose bushes increase in number.`
` I've gained some distance, more than enough now!`
`Holding onto the gun and the blanket wrapped around the ingot, I once again ran with Maria.`
`...Why am I running with a gun in my right hand and the gold in my left?`
`Why don't I free one hand and grasp Maria's hand...?!!`
`I can't let go of the gun that protects my body.`
`{n}I can't let go of the gold that protects my future.`
`And yet I would let go of the hand of my daughter, who {i:is} my very future...?!`
`Run.`
` Run. Run.`
`She got out of the rose garden and began to run down the staircase through the grove of trees.`
`But Rosa knew.`
` This path through the grove was only turning and twisting many times to make it seem long.`
` She tore straight through it!`
`She had always played here since she was a kid.`
`{n}So she knew!`
`To the beach. To the beach.`
` To the sea, to the sea, to the sea.`
`And after reaching the sea?`
`Nothing to do but swim, swim swim, if Maria can't swim, I'll carry her as I swim!!`
`There is nothing but death on this island!`
`"Kya!!!"`
`"Mamaaaa?!"`
`As she raced down the stairs, she took a bad step.`
`{n}A violent pain ran up her left ankle and her mind went completely blank.`
`Rosa fell down several stairs, and stared in shock at her ankle, which was bent at an odd angle.`
`...And the blanket with the ingot wasn't there.`
` She had let go of it the instant she fell, and it had disappeared somewhere into the darkness.`
`Only the gun was left.`
`The tremors in the earth were getting closer.`
`{n}It was only a matter of time before the goat‐heads flooded in.`
`She didn't want to imagine how many there would be, or how strange they would look.`
`The lightly dancing gold pursuers arrived.`
`The gold butterflies surrounded Rosa and Maria, sparkling and clamoring as though saying "the prize is here, the prize is here".`
`Rosa couldn't even try to get up.`
`{n}The violent pain from her broken ankle was so great that she couldn't ignore it, even in her last moments.`
`Aaaaaaaaaaaaah, what am I doing...`
`{n}I had the gold, it would have been worth several million yen.`
`I might have been able to start over with that!!`
` And yet I fell, lost it, and that's not all, my own life is in danger, even Maria's life is in danger?!`
`......What has my life been?!!!`
`I was born in an incomprehensible house!`
`{n}With an irritating older brother and sister since the day I was born!!`
`What did I do?!`
`No matter what I did or didn't do, I was always in trouble and bullied and made fun of!!`
` What has my life been?!?!`
`"Mama..., Mama, Mama...!!"`
`"........................"`
`The roar inside Rosa's heart shriveled away and disappeared.`
`...It disappeared when she listened to Maria's crying voice, as her daughter sobbed and clung onto her.`
`".........Maria.`
` Mama remembered that there's something she has to do.`
` Please go on ahead."`
`"No, no no no no!!`
` Want to be with Mama!!`
` Don't want Mama to die!!"`
`"Maria,`
` ...even though I'm such a bad mama,`
` ......you still say you want to be with me?"`
`"Yes...!`
` ......Want to be with Mama...`
` Want to be with Mama...!"`
`"...I made it look like I was putting you first,`
` ...but I was always putting you off.`
` I went to your sports day,`
` I went to parent's day,`
` ...but I was always thinking about how I appeared to the world, and you were never in my eyes."`
`"......Are you saying...that you want to be together, even with that kind of mama......?`
` Even though...`
`...I've been such a bad mama............!!"`
`"Hey, Mama.`
` ...Did you know?`
` There's only one Mama in the world.`
` There's no good Mama or bad Mama.`
` ...There's just one Mama.`
` So all I want is for Mama, the only Mama in the world, to be here.`
` And I want to become the only Maria for Mama."`
`".........The Maria who's in a good mood that you want to spoil, and the Maria who's a nuisance and you don't want to be around, aren't different people.`
` I'm also just one Maria.`
` ......So the scary Mama and the nice Mama are just like that.`
` ......To me,`
` ...there is just one...`
`...Mama......"`
`"...............I was...`
`......such...`
`.........an idiot...`
` .........I didn't need gold.`
` If only I had just pulled your hand...`
` ......I was such a...`
`...stupid mama...!!"`
`The shadows of the goats covered the sky even more than the trees of the forest.`
`{n}Their roars blotted out the world with fear.`
`Rosa, still hugging Maria, readied her gun with one hand.`
`"Maria, let's go together.`
` Always together.`
` ...So that Mama doesn't lose her way, always together...!"`
`"Yes...!!`
` Can see each other soon.`
` Always together...!!`
` ...Can see each other...in the Golden Land...!!"`
`"And then we'll play together!`
` Play with the "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle"!!`
` You still haven't solved more than one question, Mama, but I solved them all.`
` So I'll be the questioner!!"`
`She had bought that as a birthday present, ......and then hadn't played it with Maria after that night.`
`"Yes, let's play, together!!!`
` I promise!!!"`
`"Mamaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`Those eyes, sparkling like red‐hot lava, looked just like a group of fireflies.`
`{n}They danced, closed in, and attacked.`
`"Oooooooooooooohh, come ooooooon!!`
` Whoever wants to eat these bullets Maria chambered for me, step forwaaaaaaard,`
` uwoooo{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}oooohhh!!!"`
`"................................."`
`Rosa woke up from her doze.`
`......It must have been a very deep sleep.`
`{n}Her mind was fuzzy and she wasn't thinking clearly.`
`Where was she...`
`{n}It felt like some mansion, but at least it didn't seem to be the Ushiromiya family mansion.`
`She was in a room that looked like a parlor.`
`......And there was some tea that had been prepared.`
`{n}It had almost certainly been prepared for her.`
`Sparkles like gold leaf were dancing around the room, and it looked very dreamlike.`
`...She eventually realized that they were gold butterflies, which made that stand out even more.`
`There was someone across from her.`
`......Female.`
` ......A lady.`
`.........The witch...`
`of the portrait.`
`She looked like she was having a one‐sided conversation.`
`She was probably talking to Rosa,`
` but Rosa's mind was clouded up by a deep fog, and she didn't have a clue what was being said...`
`"......It can be anything.`
` If there is anything you desire, I will give you it all.`
` You may think of it as a reward for your good luck, or as a proper trade for my demands."`
`"To you, it may not be that great a thing at all.`
` But that is how significant this transaction is to me."`
`............What is she...talking about.`
`...I don't know,`
` ...I don't know.`
`"Only, ......considering that I {i:am} a witch,`
` I think it would be wise to ask for something that only a witch can grant."`
`"Isn't this a rare chance.`
` You can actually receive a favor from me, {f:5:Beatrice} the Golden.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"........................u........."`
`Finally, Rosa started to feel the blood flowing through her body.`
`{n}...Her movements were still sluggish, and she couldn't even voice the words she was thinking.`
`"I am commonly called the Golden Witch.`
` Bestowing a mountain of gold, like I gave to Kinzo, is no problem for me.`
` ......After all, every pleasure of the human world can be expressed in terms of cash.`
` Put another way, gold is human pleasure itself."`
`"Can you imagine?`
` A mountain of gold that you couldn't use up as long as you lived."`
`The witch blew on her pipe, and seven colors of smoke covered the area.`
`When she did, the inside of the parlor...had suddenly become filled with stacks of gold ingots.`
`It looked like a shining gold‐colored wall.`
`...If each ingot was worth tens of millions of yen,`
` how much would all of this be worth?`
`It seemed sinful to even think of that number.`
`"......However, the human world is difficult.`
` I know that there are some things that cannot be satisfied no matter how high into the sky you pile up gold.`
` I know that there are cracks that can't be filled."`
`"I won't make light of that, and in fact, I believe that is why this is a gift that only a witch such as I can give."`
`"......Why don't I fill those cracks in for you?`
` Yes, how about this.`
` It's something that only I can give.`
` You should be very happy."`
`"......You don't have to say it out loud.`
` I can understand it right away, the cracks in your heart are written on your face, *cackle*cackle*!"`
`Rosa felt a touch of discomfort at this witch,`
` who kept on talking even though she herself hadn't uttered a single word,`
` but since she still couldn't speak well, and found it difficult even to move a finger, she could do nothing about it,`
` and was unable to do anything but listen.`
`"How far back must I trace the deep wounds in your heart in order to heal them?"`
`"......This is...`
`...deep,`
` deep.`
` ......Sometimes, wounds close up while a fragment of something is still inside.`
` ...Even when those wounds appear to have healed, they will continue to throb for all eternity.`
` Sometimes you have to open the wound once to completely heal it."`
`As the witch spoke, she was staring deep into Rosa's eyes.`
`......What in the world...was she peering at?`
` Rosa felt uncomfortable, but she couldn't look away.`
`"............So this pain of yours was preordained from your very birth.`
` ...How heart‐breaking.`
` ...You don't have to say it.`
` I understand.`
` ......I understand......"`
`Gradually, Rosa, in turn, was drawn into the witch's eyes.`
`Gradually, the world grew dark, spinning round and round as she was sucked in...`
`Rosa, Rosa.`
` Why are you such an idiot?`
`Oh, that's Krauss nii‐san's voice.`
`{n}Krauss nii‐san is very grown‐up, so he's very smart.`
`{n}So he hated the stupid kid Rosa.`
`And he was a very scary person, and I was often hit, and my toys were taken from me and broken.`
`He would say it was a punishment because I did something bad, but I didn't really understand what that was, or why I was being punished.`
`I was always punished suddenly, and then after the fact, I was told in a contrived manner that it was a punishment for something or other,`
` but it was always something I didn't remember doing.`
`......So I really hated Krauss nii‐san.`
`Rosa, Rosa.`
` Why are you such an idiot?`
`Oh, that's Eva nee‐san's voice.`
`{n}Eva nee‐san is very grown‐up, so she's very smart.`
`{n}So she hated the stupid kid Rosa.`
`And she was a very sly person, and I was often lied to, tricked, and bullied a lot.`
`She would say it was because I was stupid, and that it was only natural for stupid people to be swindled by those smarter than them.`
`So I wanted to become a wise person like Eva nee‐san, and listened to what she said, but when I obeyed her, for some reason, someone always got really mad at me.`
`......So I really hated Eva nee‐san.`
`Rosa, Rosa.`
` Why are you such an idiot?`
`Oh, that's Rudolf nii‐san's voice.`
`{n}Rudolf nii‐san is very shrewd.`
`{n}So he hated the stupid kid Rosa.`
`When Krauss nii‐san was around, he was friendly with Krauss nii‐san.`
`{n}When Eva nee‐san was around, he was friendly with Eva nee‐san.`
`...And when Krauss nii‐san wasn't around, he was violent like Krauss nii‐san,`
` and when Eva nee‐san wasn't around, he played dirty like Eva nee‐san.`
`And even though he too was bullied most of the time,`
` when Krauss nii‐san and Eva nee‐san weren't around, he gave me two people's worth of bullying.`
`......So I really hated Rudolf nii‐san.`
`......Oh, but these are my memories from when I was a kid.`
`Quite a lot of unfair things happen when you're a kid.`
`{n}And you can't drag them out forever.`
`In time, you bury them away in the far reaches of memory, and forget them bit by bit; that is supposed to be what it means to grow up, and become an adult.`
`So becoming an adult is the same thing as separating yourself from all of those memories.`
`And so.`
` No matter how much time passed, Rosa couldn't become an adult.`
`......Even though she had been blessed with a daughter called Maria and was called a mother,`
` ...she didn't at all feel like she had become an adult.`
`The witch pitied that.`
`And she smiled, saying that she could heal that pain herself.`
`"......How to heal you.`
` It's possible, but not easy.`
` ...I could even rewind time, and give you a world where you have no elder siblings."`
`"But that way, your "memories of being hurt by your elder siblings" wouldn't remain,`
` and therefore, you would be unable to acknowledge it as a reward."`
`"It is the relieving of hunger that brings satisfaction.`
` If you erase hunger itself, no one will thank you.`
` Just like how there are no young people who give thanks for their daily gluttony.`
` ......Understand?"`
`I think she just told me something really difficult.`
`...In short, even if she makes it so that I never had elder siblings, the pain wouldn't be removed,`
` maybe that's what she's saying.`
`Strictly speaking, it's different.`
`{n}Healing isn't the same thing as removing pain.`
`{n}It's the pleasure earned for withstanding pain.`
`Therefore, there can be no healing without pain.`
`{n}To know the joy of healing, you have to know the pain.`
`"In that case, ......you will require joy that compensates for your pain.`
` You can feel proud of the past you have suffered.`
` Because you are qualified to know a kind of pleasure that those who have not known suffering cannot taste.`
` ...Those that have known this pleasure cannot help but give the same joy to others...`
` *cackle*cackle*..."`
`The witch snapped her fingers, and even though the room was still filled with a mountain of gold,`
` and was already like something from another world, a fabulous tablecloth appeared on top of the table,`
` and wonderful cooking was laid out, almost as though it was the opening of a banquet in a castle from some fairy tale.`
`For an instant, Rosa felt a pleasurable surprise at how fabulous it was,`
` ...but at the same time, she felt a bit of anticlimax.`
`Because she found herself thinking that being bullied by her siblings...`
`couldn't be wiped away by just one meal, no matter how delicious.`
`"Food contains many of the human pleasures.`
` You must eat like a pig as long as you live."`
`"If one meal isn't enough, then as many as you want.`
` Let us continue this gourmet banquet until the pain of your heart is healed.`
` ......Begin, furniture."`
`As the witch clapped twice,`
` there were suddenly goat‐head servants there, and they began to prepare the meal.`
`From the beautiful food dishes adorning the table, they efficiently took some food and began to pile it up on Rosa's plate.`
`It really did look delicious, but Rosa's body still felt as heavy as lead,`
` and there was no way she could eat.`
`Maybe they also understood that.`
`The goat‐head servants tied a napkin around Rosa's collar,`
` and gallantly brought a glass of before‐dinner alcohol to her mouth, and even tilted it for her.`
`She remembered an old servant who had once carried rice porridge to her mouth when she was laid up with a high fever.`
`She couldn't drink it well, and it dripped down from her mouth, but she felt the fragrant sweetness spread throughout her mouth.`
`"It's a sweet aperitif of noble rot German‐made wine.`
` A wine cocktail of white wine tinged with crimson golden drops."`
`"If I had to give it a name, I'd call it a Bloody Krauss.`
` The color comes solely from golden drops of your brother's blood, obtained by placing him in a compressor."`
`"Bghk......?! *cough*, *cough*......!!"`
`Rosa coughed violently.`
` And the bright red that stained her face made it look as though she had coughed up blood.`
`"You know a lot about black tea, so you should know what it means, right?`
` "Golden drop" refers to the last drop.`
` It is called the most precious drop in black tea."`
`".........So a golden drop of blood is the same.`
` The last and most precious drop of blood squeezed out of a human.`
` It's squeezed with that."`
`As the witch snapped her fingers, a bright red veil was pulled off something large which had not been there moments ago.`
`......The solemn and massive machine there was just like...`
`a coffin for a large‐sized person, with many large bulb‐like things stuck to it,`
` and it looked like a sinister torture device.`
`By its unnerving shape,`
` you could tell that it used manpower to tighten and compress something.`
`...And it seemed that there were still some squeezed dregs remaining inside,`
` because of the bright red remains that stained it.`
`"But you can't take more than one golden drop at once.`
` No matter what kind of human you take it from, you can't get more than one drop.`
` But I am a witch.`
` It is also easy to revive a person."`
`When the witch snapped her fingers, suddenly, the human compressor began to shake.`
` ...No, you could also hear a groan.`
`......It looked almost as though someone had been sleeping in that man‐sized coffin,`
` had woken up, and was now struggling to get out.`
`But that was wrong.`
`{n}What was inside had definitely {i:been squeezed dregs}.`
`Using her magic, the witch had once again revived the squeezed dregs to how they had been before they were squeezed.`
`Three goat‐head servants with muscular physiques approached the compressor, and forcefully started tightening the large bulbs.`
`...As they did, an unearthly moan came from the inside of the coffin.`
`{n}...Rosa thought she knew the owner of that voice.`
`"It is fitting for cooking to be done in the kitchen.`
` That is enough, stand back."`
`"......Do you understand now how precious a golden drop is?`
` To have it stained this crimson requires that {i:several dozen people's worth} be squeezed."`
`The witch had definitely said that only one golden drop could be taken from a single human.`
`And yet, she had dozens of people's worth of golden drops from a single human.`
`{n}......Only a witch could do this.`
`The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} could kill a single human "endlessly".`
`......In other words, before {f:5:Beatrice}, even death did not mean release.`
`"Want a second sip?`
` Have you forgotten the day this man hit you, and you swallowed the blood that ran into your mouth?"`
`"That's right, remember that taste.`
` Remember the taste of the tears that you spilled until you were dry.`
` I believe this aperitif will be sufficient to heal that regrettable memory.`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`Once again, the goat‐head servants tilted the deep red glass against her mouth.`
`...Rosa attempted to close her lips in resistance,`
` but the deep red liquid was relentlessly poured into her mouth, which was hanging open with shock,`
` and the inside of her mouth was filled with a ghastly sweetness...`
`It was definitely a fragrant sweetness.`
`Her brother, who she had thought of so hatefully, and who had made her soak her pillow so many times,`
` had died dozens of times over to tinge this wine crimson, so it must have tasted sweet.`
`But Rosa tried to spit it out.`
`Because of that, the deep red wine that spilled out of Rosa's mouth made her look as if she was covered in blood.`
`......If this ghastly substance was only the aperitif,`
` Rosa couldn't help but feel uncomfortable about what would happen if this banquet continued.`
`"That is a forked‐tongued salad made from vegetables in season.`
` ...On your ninth birthday, you wished you could bite it off someday—so here is that salad you desired, made from Eva's tongue."`
`"........................!!!"`
`When Rosa heard the true nature of the pink‐colored meat piled up in the salad,`
` she had a sudden impulse to vomit her guts out.`
`...Furthermore, the goat servants stuck a fork in it, and carried it to Rosa's mouth.`
`"How does your sister's forked tongue taste?`
` It must be quite soft and enchanting, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`How sweet, soft and enchanting it must have tasted in her mouth.`
`After all, Eva's lies were always sweet, and young Rosa had always listened to them.`
`...So you could say that the taste of the stimulating pepper seasoning that had been added expressed the details of those lies well.`
`"......mnnnnnnnnnnn!!`
` mnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!"`
`Rosa spat out the tongue salad that kept being pushed into her mouth, covering it with saliva.`
`But the goat‐head servants carefully returned it to the plate and carried it to Rosa's mouth over and over again.`
`"It goes without saying, but I made this salad generously using five of Eva's tongues.`
` You can't steal more than one tongue out of one person.`
` But I can steal it over and over.`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`".........nnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!`
` nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!"`
`As Rosa's tears dripped down, she resisted, half‐crazed.`
`{n}However, the only way she could resist was by refusing to swallow.`
`Even if she didn't swallow it,`
` the taste of the french dressing increasingly violated Rosa's mouth...`
`"Is it not to your satisfaction...?`
` There's still much more food.`
` Sea bass pie wrapped in the skin of Rudolf's face.`
` Soup with boiled brains, liver pate.`
` And look forward to dessert, *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"It's not just your siblings, see?`
` I have lavishly arranged all of those who you have trusted and yet betrayed you.`
` Why don't we continue this banquet for all eternity, until your heart is satisfied.`
` For all eternity."`
`"......You're happy, riiiight, Ushiromiya Rosaaaa?`
` Don't pretend that you hate it I know that you're really happy alriiight?`
` If you want to laugh, then laugh,`
` if you won't feel better until you've heard a live performance of your annoying elder siblings' screams, then I'll let you hear them as often as you want."`
`"It's alright that you are so unwilling.`
` That's your personality, isn't it?`
` You're actually so happy that your skin is crawling all over.`
` And yet, on the outside, you're just pretending to act like you're in pain, aren't youuu?"`
`"It's alright, there is no need to worry about honor or your public image or anything here,`
` so laugh as much as you want and chew it to bits.`
` Isn't this the bessst banquet, Ushiromiya Rosaaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaaaa???"`
`".........st‐`
` .........please,`
` ......stop......`
`...*cough*, *hack*!!`
` uweghhh..."`
`"Oh, I'm sorry, I was keeping the dessert a secret to surprise you, but let me reveal it anyways.`
` If I reveal it, maybe that will be enough incentive for you to eat up the full course."`
`"The dessert is that beloved daughter that you had to keep pretending to love,`
` oven‐baked Maria and apples.`
` Doesn't that sound yummyyyy?"`
`"If you eat this, you will be released from everything.`
` Freedom, you see, freedom!`
` Finally Rosa will gain freedom as an individual person, aren't you happyyyy{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}yyyyyy?`
` Of course you are, drool is hanging from your mouth, just try looking in a mirroooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooooor, hyaha{0}haaa{0}haa{0}haa{0}haha!!"`
`Suddenly, a muscular goat‐head cook was holding Maria under his arm.`
`And Maria gazed at Rosa with a face that was just slightly sad.`
`"............Mama...`
` ......Was I......a burden......?"`
`"...nnnnnnn!`
` You aren't a burden!!`
` nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!"`
`As Rosa spat out the food that was continually being carried to her mouth,`
` as she was covered with mess and saliva and blood, she resisted filthily and screamed.`
`"......If you...`
`think I'm a burden, Mama,`
` ......I'm fine being eaten."`
`".........After all, I always do horrible things to you, Mama.`
` Even when you brought a man over, I couldn't stay quiet.`
` When you stayed over with a man, I got lonely and unruly and made a mess of the room."`
`"When I went to search by myself, I got lost, the police had to pick me up and I brought shame on you, Mama.`
` When you didn't come home for days, I cried and had to be cheered up by the neighbors, and brought shame on you again, Mama."`
`"Because I'm like this, I cause trouble for you, Mama.`
` I'm sorry for being born.`
` So I'll become delicious oven‐baked apples for you, Mama."`
`"And then, maybe I can make you happy I exist for the first time.`
` Maybe, if you eat me and you think I'm delicious."`
`"She will be, riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight?`
` Be choked up with tears of gratitude your daughter is saying this much for you seeeeeee?`
` Oven‐baked apples and your beloved daughter make for the best dessert!`
` You've managed to raise such delicious ingredients,`
` aren't you the best mother, Ushiromiya Rosaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaaaaa???"`
`".........Mama, thanks for everything.`
` Bye bye."`
`"Wait!!`
` Wait, Maria, that's wrong!!`
` Stop it already, stop it already,`
` noooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooooo!!`
` I didn't want something like this!"`
`"Please stop, please let me go!!`
` No,`
` stop it already,`
` don't put it...in my mouth...`
` uuuuulg,`
` gweeeeeeeeeeeeehh!!"`
`"Have you found my hospitality to your satisfaction...?`
` Then I'll have you accept it.`
` That I am a witch.`
` Proclaim it.`
` Proclaim that "Ushiromiya Rosa accepts that {f:5:Beatrice} is a witch"!!"`
`"......I accept it!!`
` U‐Ushiromiya Rosa...`
`...accepts that B‐{f:5:Beatrice}...`
`...is a witch!!`
` So give Maria back!!`
` Release meeeeeee{-}e{-}e{-}eeeee!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*, hahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!!`
` I finally made you accept it!!`
` That smart‐alecky Battler has already submitted, and now I've made even Rosa accept it, the fool who denied me after being invited to the Golden Land!!`
` Perfect!!`
` <It's perfect!!>"`
`"I've accomplished my perfect victory!!`
` *cackle*, haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hakya‐HAH‐HAH‐HAH‐HAH‐HAH‐HA!!`
` Now, take Maria away, prepare a delicious oven roast for Rosa!!"`
`"Nooooooooooooooooooooooo, Mariaaaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaaaaa!!"`
`"Looks delicious.`
` Slice up your cow tits and make me a sandwich."`
`"Wha‐......th‐that voice!!`
` Ooof?!"`
`An arm grabbed the back of the witch's head and smashed her face into the table.`
`As it did, the witch broke to pieces, turned into a group of gold butterflies, and reformed into her body a short distance away.`
`"Ba‐.........Battler?!?!`
` Y‐......you cursed man,`
` ...I, I thought you became furniture, that you submitted down to your very soul!!"`
`"I thought I did too.`
` ...But while I was listening to your gross recipes, I started to get a little hungry."`
`"Now I feel like eating a whole roast witch!!"`
`"And Maria.`
` It's ten years too early for you to talk about having someone eat you.`
` But in ten years, you have to say that to me. Promise."`
`"......Uu.`
` Promise."`
`"Ba‐...Battler‐kun...!"`
`"Sorry to keep you waiting, Auntie Rosa.`
` I had forgotten.`
` This was a one‐on‐one fight between me and this woman.`
` I was never supposed to give in.`
` ......Thanks to your persistence, I've regained my will to fight!!"`
`......Th‐...this man, he was broken to the depths of his soul, and capitulated to me...`
`......I see, he doesn't know when to give up, just what I'd expect from Ushiromiya Kinzo's grandson...!`
` So the chick of a phoenix is a phoenix after all...!`
`"Fu...fuhahahahahahahahaha, how vigorous, I like it!`
` I wouldn't have it any other way!!"`
`"That is exactly what I expect from you, Ushiromiya Battler!!`
` Try to deny me, I'll completely and thoroughly smash you to bits!`
` I will break you over and over again, and I'll teach you, one who has licked my shoes, the taste of defeat over and over!!"`
`"No problem, I'll teach you that I, Ushiromiya Battler, am a man who'll stand back up even after crawling in the mud!!"`
`"I've never had the experience of being invincible in a fight.`
` I've lost many times."`
`"But I always crawl through the mud and stand up again.`
` And I always finish what I started!!`
` In a man's fight, you don't lose until you accept defeat, no matter how much you get beat up!!"`
`"Don't think I'm out just because you took a shot at me.`
` Entertain me, {f:5:Beatriceeeeeeeeeeeee}!!"`
`"I'll accept your challenge, Ushiromiya Battler!!`
` Furniture, begin preparations for the next game!!"`
`"And while we're waiting, I have much I want to hear from you!`
` There were many locked rooms in this game.`
` Using red, I've smashed to bits most of the methods by which you tried to talk yourself out.`
` What other evasive quibbles will you show me now?!!"`
`"The lock to the chapel, the lock to Jessica's room, the lock to the servant room, the lock to Natsuhi's room, the lock to the parlor!!`
` Use all those things you humans are so good at pulling out of the blue,`
` your delusions, rantings, daydreams, bluffs,`
` all slanted with ridiculous, incredible turns of events, and show how you can thoroughly deny meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!"`
`"Aaah, it's no good,`
` it's no goddamn good at aaaaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaaaaaallllll!!!"`
`"Well then.`
` ...Did you enjoy it?`
` Our game just now."`
`"......A game that one‐sided goes beyond captivating and becomes boring."`
`"*cackle*cackle*. My, my, a harsh critic as always.`
` ......And I was so certain that even Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, who has no love for boredom,`
` would surely be satisfied by this compelling development... How remorseless."`
`"...Well, I'll accept that it was compelling.`
` ...However, it was horrible as a fair game.`
` You need the conditions to be a little more even, or—"`
`"......Am I about to be told there's no way to win?`
` By Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}?`
` ......*cackle*cackle*."`
`"..................I wonder what you mean by that, Beato."`
`"There's no need to play ignorant.`
` I already know.`
` ...That you {i:aren't a bystander}."`
`"................................."`
`"You thought you were hiding it?`
` How insolent, to travel all that way, and come into territory that isn't yours, just to bet against me.`
` You came here planning to watch my game from the sidelines, while having a large stake placed in my defeat.`
` I've guessed right, haven't I...?"`
`"...........................`
` And if so?"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*!`
` Truly interesting!"`
`"That I should be granted a chance to fight against Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, the strongest of witches who defeated Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, is truly a pleasure!!"`
`"......Yes.`
` It is pleasing me too.`
` After all, I came all this way just because I wanted to see you brimming with that confidence, only to fall apart and lose."`
`"What an honest person.`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"Incidentally, if the contest between me and the great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}...`
`were not to have at least one observer, what a tremendous shame that would be."`
`".................................`
` ...You called her, didn't you.`
` That child."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!`
` I found you, I finally found you, {f:5:Bernkastel}!!"`
`"............How are you, Lambda?`
` Looks like you also have time to kill.`
` ...I wonder if it's fate that we who share no love for boredom should run into each other again...?"`
`"Such a dumb kid.`
` Why can't you realize that the only reason you won against me was because of a little luck and a not‐so‐great matchup?`
` That made you so snobby, and now you're even picking a fight with {f:5:Beatrice}? Shouldn't you learn your place?"`
`"*giggle*, {f:5:Beatrice} is strong, you know.`
` And she's more brutal than I am.`
` Just a teensy bit!"`
`"Oh and also, don't just shorten someone's name to Lambda!"`
`".........You're a fool too, Beato.`
` This kid won't make exceptions for your game, she'll turn everything into a preposterous farce."`
`"I didn't bring Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} here solely to watch from the sidelines."`
`"After I informed her that you were betting against me, she said that she would bet against you."`
`"..............................You're still holding a grudge, aren't you."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!!`
` 'Cause I'm the strongest witch in the universe.`
` But I lost to you so I'm not the strongest!"`
`"So I'm taking the side of anyone who's against youuuu!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` There you have it.`
` With the great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} as our opponent, this may not even count as a handicap, but it will be suitable for entertainment."`
`"...............Do as you like.`
` ...Now that the cat's out of the bag, I'm going to get serious."`
`"That would be suitable.`
` "Leniency" has never featured in my dictionary.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, let us enjoy our valuable new relationship."`
`"Yes, I'll be counting on you, Lady {f:5:Beatrice}!`
` This girl really put me through the wringer.`
` I'm not gonna be happy until the two of us have smushed her up and paid her back double!!"`
`"............I look forward to it, Lambda.`
` And Beato.`
` ...No matter who wins or who loses, this will be a very meaningful battle for us."`
`"That's right.`
` Of course, I'm not gonna lose easy, but this is more important than winning and losing."`
`"After all, we have no love for boredom."`
`The three witches giggled, cackled, and guffawed.`
`"......That's right.`
` I should thank you, Beato.`
` It looks like I can finally escape boredom.`
` Do your best to entertain me.`
` Together with {f:5:Lambdadelta}."`
`"I shall do just that.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!!"`
`"That's that, Beato, so let's start a strategy meeting right now!`
` I know all of this girl's weak points, and I'm gonna teach you all of them!"`
`"And yet, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, you were defeated by her, I note... *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"Urrrrrrrrgggh, I won't tell you, I won't tell you!`
` Tsuun!"`
`"*cackle*cackle* hahhahahahahahaha!`
` ...She never bores, that Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}."`
`"............She doesn't, does she?`
` Take care of her.`
` She might not look it, but she gets lonely."`
`"I see.`
` So she's one of those newfangled whatchamacallits.`
` *cackle*, as expected from Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` Quite cutting edge.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`"Go already.`
` That child's waiting for you to chase after her."`
`"......Then, if you'll excuse me."`
`"See you next game.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`......I'm sorry.`
` A troublesome one came, but don't mind her.`
`More importantly,`
` .........things sure got ugly.`
`I thought I had experienced some particularly gruesome ends in my game with Lambda,`
` .........but this time, ......it's exceptionally horrible.`
`...It isn't as though I don't understand your desire to hug your knees and close your heart.`
`If you meet that end several more times,`
` your heart will be killed within a hundred years.`
`......Beato saw through me, so I'll confess.`
`You are now just like I was in the past, when I was imprisoned inside Lambda's world.`
`Shut inside a labyrinth of cruel fate, tormented at the whims of a witch.`
`...I am a witch who was born from there.`
`......So maybe I'm like an older sister to you.`
` So I decided that I'd lend you my power.`
`However,`
` ............even compared to my fate,`
` ......yours is...truly brutal.`
`Not only do I sympathize with you, I'm almost brought to tears by your tragic fate.`
`But please, don't lose heart.`
`Please don't submit to Beato, no matter what.`
`Certainly, that child's game is quite unfair.`
`I took a glimpse of the game board, and the tricks are so mean and cunning,`
` and the scenic tricks are filthy to a degree that probably far surpasses that of {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s game board.`
`And what's even more frightening is that when that child moves a piece, it's not like she always makes the best possible move.`
`This is where she is very different from Lambda.`
`Lambda always uses an overpowering number of pieces and makes the best possible move, in order to win.`
`But Beato sometimes intentionally eases up when she moves her pieces.`
`This is unfortunate for us, trying to seek out our opponent's strategy by looking at her moves,`
` because it creates a formidable amount of noise in our information.`
`This disorder could be troublesome.`
`......However, as in chess,`
` a player might be able to create some noise for their opponent with a useless move, but they would still miss out on a more valuable move.`
`In other words, it's not like your opportunities to take advantage of it are zero.`
`Although you may not be able to believe it, this game was also like that.`
`......Even though those developments looked so overpowering,`
` ...there actually were weak points.`
`It looks almost as if she wants us to take advantage of them.`
`......Although, I don't know if it's a trap or if she's testing us.`
`Anyway, don't surrender.`
`Don't stop thinking.`
`Don't deny any possibility.`
`As long as you continue to hold the will to fight, Beato will not win.`
`Defense is crucial during a witch's battle, you know?`
`Rather than trying to win, try not to lose.`
`...If you lose when you accept her, then you definitely must not accept her.`
`......Making you accept witches.`
`There is no longer any doubt that this is one of {f:5:Beatrice}'s victory conditions.`
`Now that I have announced that I am your ally, I too will make an effort to lend you as much of my power as I can.`
`Make an effort yourself as well.`
`If you're still hugging your knees, quickly stand back up.`
`......Umm, in times like this, what did I use to say again?`
`.........Umm, uh,`
` .........Fi‐`
`...fight,`
` yea~h.`
` Mii,`
` nipah~{p:0:☆}`
`..................It's so embarrassing, doing this.`
`......I've done this much for you, so hurry and stand back up.`
`"...Ah, there you are.`
` Did Bern shrink off somewhere?`
` *giggle*, could she be any more lame?"`
`Anywho.`
`The pieces Bern chooses are crummy as usual, huh.`
`It's the same with chess, right?`
`If all your pieces were pawns, you'd have zero chance to win, right?`
`If all your pieces were rooks and bishops, no way you'd lose.`
`......W‐well, last time, I felt just a little pity and said that she could start her pieces anywhere she wants,`
` and then that idiot Bern totally didn't pick up on my compassion and started with aaall of her pawns promoted on the eighth rank!!`
`What's up with that, that wasn't a loss or anything!!`
` Aaah, just remembering that makes me queasy.`
`So, see, I'm gonna be ruffled until I see Bern's stupid speechless face.`
`So it's like, seeing you in this state as Bern's piece, that makes me feel just awesome!`
`Plus, believe it or not, that girl really hates to lose,`
` so I bet she's definitely grinding her teeth in frustration right about now, crying like a baby,`
` she's so lame, *giggle*, hohhh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!`
`C'mon, laugh with me, oh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!`
`............Wait a sec.`
`Are you still hugging your knees?`
`You're already like this just because Beato got a little serious?`
`Could you be any more pathetic?`
`You're so pathetic, I'll help you just a little bit.`
`I, the great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, the Witch of Certainty and the strongest in the universe,`
` will bring your hopeless chances of winning just a teensy bit closer to certainty.`
` You better thank me.`
`You know, {f:5:Beatrice} may really be a cruel and powerful witch, but she's no match for me.`
`Why?`
` 'Cause she's soft.`
`That kid will make the board so she can win with just a few more moves, but she deliberately won't finish you off.`
`She'll do stuff like take worthless pieces, or put way too many pieces on the board to make things even more one‐sided.`
`The point is, she's got this bad habit of playing around when she thinks she's going to win.`
`Almost all the various attacks that are painful for you and Bern...`
`look like a total waste and overkill to me.`
`...Basically, that's her weakness, and it's also your chance.`
` See?`
` She isn't an opponent to be afraid of, right?`
`She sometimes mistakes the means for the end.`
`And she has too much bad fun.`
`As a result, she makes and even exposes her own weak points.`
`It's impossible for a strongest‐ever witch like me to understand why she acts so relaxed.`
`Lowering her own chances of winning.`
`.........But, well.`
`That's why the type of witch like Bern who reads her opponent and dodges their moves has a really bad matchup with her.`
` 'Cause reading her doesn't work.`
`...It's probably really easy for Bern to read and handle an obedient and honest type like me.`
` That makes me so mad!`
`...Well, still, a super‐firepower type like me can easily go head‐on against a light, wide‐range barrage type like {f:5:Beatrice},`
` so I guess it's kinda like rock‐paper‐scissors.`
`If I'm paper, Beato's rock.`
`I guess Bern would be scissors.`
`Weeelll, maybe none of that matters anyway.`
`Sure, my paper loses to Bern's scissors,`
` but if it was the way more awesome super‐paper, which is as thick as wood, it could even beat scissors, right?!`
`In other words, I, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta},`
` am super‐paper, and super‐thick!`
` Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!`
`It looks like the color's come back to your face a little.`
`That Beato, she's having fun torturing some piece called Rosa.`
`At a glance, you'd think she has really nasty hobbies, right?`
` Wrong, though!`
`......She's just killing time, hoping you'll get up and come back.`
`It's a move to fire up your righteous indignation by doing something to make you hate her on purpose.`
`Ah man, I hate kids like that!`
`Well then, I'll go back.`
`Ah!`
` Don't you tell anyone that I helped you out just a teensy bit!`
`I mean, it's not like I helped you because I wanted to save you, okay?!`
`I, the strongest witch in the universe, had my seat as the strongest stolen when I lost to Bern!`
`So it's like, I have to take that seat back from Bern,`
` but if Bern loses to Beato here, then the position of the strongest will be moved to Beato this time, right?!`
`...Well, it'd be easier to steal it back from Beato, so who cares really, but that won't satisfy me, you know what I mean?!`
`I'm gonna be the one to defeat Bern!`
`And I'll take back my position as the strongest!`
`It's not like I'm really helping you, okay?!`
`I won't forgive you if you make Bern cry!`
`The vase was very, very beautiful, rich with history and value.`
`Even as young as I was, it still forced me to take a deep breath when I witnessed its beauty.`
`Of course, it was one of Grandfather's favorite collection pieces.`
`So that I didn't accidentally destroy its fragile beauty,`
` I was always strictly ordered never to touch it.`
`......But that just made me want to touch it.`
`You could almost see right through it, and yet it was so elegant; it appeared so weightless, and yet it had an indescribable presence.`
`...I wanted to see what it felt like to touch a vase like that.`
`However, ...just as Grandfather had said, it was something that must not be touched.`
`This much beauty arises precisely because it must never be touched.`
`It was a beauty that could only dwell in something so fragile it would break at a touch.`
`Which is exactly why, if it were to be touched by my impudent finger, it would oh so easily—`
`Just like an enjoyable morning dream fading into nothing as you wake...`
`......it vanished, fell, and broke into smithereens.`
`I realized that, because of my own foolish curiosity, I had done something that couldn't be taken back.`
`No matter how much I regretted it, no matter how much I apologized.`
`{n}The broken vase would not return to its original form...`
`I would probably be scolded by Grandfather.`
`{n}Probably very harshly.`
`Frightened, I ended up breaking into tears and sobbing...`
`As I did, I noticed something............beautiful.`
` Lightly dancing golden butterflies...`
`were coming towards me.`
`The beautiful butterflies began to gather, one at a time, glittering fantastically with glowing golden powder.`
`Oh, it's {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}That reliable Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice} had arrived.`
`The butterflies gathered one after another, grouped together, and there, became her form...`
`She was always on my side.`
`{n}Whenever I was in trouble, she would always appear and help me.`
`"Good day to you, princess."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}!`
` ......uuuughu, hic, hic...!"`
`"Oh, my...`
` Why are you crying so on a day so perfect for a tea party, my princess...?"`
`"...I broke Grandfather's precious vase...`
` Uugh... Grandfather will get mad at me.`
` ...I don't know what I should do...`
` hic..."`
`"That is indeed worrying.`
` I believe the Master greatly treasured this particular vase.`
` ......Hohohoho, it's terrifying even for me to think about what kind of punishment you'll receive."`
`Grandfather was a very frightening person.`
`And once he told you something, if you failed to follow it, he would become mad with a rage that would make even the fallen angels in hell quiver.`
`I was intimately familiar with that, which is why I couldn't do anything but shake like this and cry...`
`"I hold no magic to scoop up your fallen tears, princess,`
` but if you want magic that will make it possible for you to avoid being scolded by the Master, I might be able to do something."`
`"R‐really...?"`
`"If you will believe in my power, princess.`
` The basis of magic power is the power of belief.`
` ......Miracles will only appear before those who strongly believe."`
`"I, ...I believe...`
` I believe in your magic, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` So please fix this vase.`
` Please...!"`
`"If that is what you want, princess.`
` ......Very well, then leave it to me."`
`When she extended her index finger, a golden butterfly softly landed there, and changed its form into her favorite magic wand.`
`Even that was enough to give me a small glimpse at {f:5:Beatrice}'s wonderful and great magic power.`
`She pointed her wand at the broken vase, and, just like a child's lullaby, she began speaking the magic words...`
`"Come, try closing your eyes.`
` And try to remember.`
` What form did you have?`
` It was surely a very, very beautiful form.`
` Please, show me that form one more time..."`
`Were they words, or was it a song?`
`No, it was surely magic.`
`After all, can't you see? ...The pieces of the vase are gathering together in no time at all,`
` ...and softly returning to the place where they had been displayed, ......returning to their original beautiful form.`
`"......Incredible..."`
`"See?`
` Now it's back to normal.`
` This way, you will be able to avoid being yelled at by the Master."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}, you sure are incredible.`
` It was no trouble for you to repair a broken vase."`
`"That's not true.`
` Returning something broken to its original form is a very, very difficult thing.`
` With my magic, I could do no more than make it remember what it was, for the time being."`
`"......?`
` But, the vase really turned back to the way it was, right...?"`
`"That's right.`
` But that doesn't mean that I caused the vase to avoid its fate of being broken.`
` I did nothing but make the broken vase remember how it was before it broke for the time being.`
` Magic power that can repair a broken fate to its original form is at a very high level that even I have yet to reach."`
`At that time, the high‐pitched scream of a servant could be heard from inside the mansion.`
`When I went to see what had happened,`
` ......I noticed that several of the servants had gathered, and were cleaning up the remains of the broken vase.`
`From what they said, it seemed that a black cat had sneaked in from somewhere, climbed up on the vase, and toppled it over.`
`I understood the meaning of what {f:5:Beatrice} had said.`
`...At the time that I broke the vase, "the vase had been broken".`
`{f:5:Beatrice} had shown me that the vase had been restored, but that had been a temporary thing.`
` It didn't mean the fate that "the vase had been broken" had changed.`
`As a result, ......the vase had remembered its true fate, and "broke".`
`{n}But I hadn't broken it; instead, it had been a cat which had snuck in...`
`That's right.`
` {f:5:Beatrice} hadn't said "Let's mend the vase".`
`She had said she would make it so that I didn't have to be punished.`
`The fate of the vase breaking hadn't changed, but the fact that I had broken it certainly had...`
`{f:5:Beatrice} had skillfully saved me from danger with that magic...`
`"It is very easy to break something.`
` Just like how you, princess, did not require magic in order to break the vase."`
`"...Fixing something is very hard...?"`
`"Yes.`
` So much so that you were at a loss at what to do and started crying."`
`"......So it's easier to use magic to do horrible things?`
` To break,`
` ......to kill is very easy,`
` ......but fixing and reviving things is very hard, as you say..."`
`"......That's right.`
` With magic, it is much easier to do things like breaking and killing.`
` Therefore, weak witches who lose to temptation become intoxicated with that power which they can easily obtain, and neglect their real magic training."`
`"......Real magic is the power to repair, to revive.`
` To call back happiness which has disappeared, to call back love which has gotten cold.`
` And it can call back a forgotten smile to a princess's face."`
`"Then, ......{f:5:Beatrice}, does that mean that since you could fix the vase, you are an incredible witch?"`
`"My days of training are far from over.`
` After all, I couldn't make the vase forget its fate for even an hour.`
` If it had been my master, who taught me magic,`
` I'm sure that she would have been able to restore the vase to its original form forever."`
`"If it broke and broke, she could fix it over and over again...?"`
`"Yes.`
` When one reaches that level, they are possessed of endless magical power.`
` That is the endless level that all witches should strive to reach.`
` As a sign of the highest respect to those witches, we call them..."`
`"An Endless Witch..."`
`"That's right.`
` ......To witches holding the power to mend something endlessly, the concept of breaking doesn't even exist.`
` They are released from all of the sadness caused by losing things and are promised eternal bliss."`
`Certainly, the human world is full of sadness caused by separation and loss.`
`To escape that sadness, people pray to God, and ask for the power to withstand the sadness, believing it to be a test...`
`In other words, a human's life is a journey, searching for a way to withstand sadness.`
`In that case, a witch who could revive all things would be freed from all sadness in the world.`
` ......In other words, it is eternal bliss...`
`"I wonder......if I could become a witch like you, and gain eternal happiness."`
`"You, princess...?`
` Hoh‐hoh‐ho... That would be a long, long, difficult path, you know?"`
`"I want to be a witch.`
` ......I want to be happy.`
` I want to be your disciple."`
`"...............`
` Do you have even the slightest doubt in that feeling?"`
`"No.`
` I want to become a witch too."`
`"......All right.`
` Then, until you get tired of it, princess, I will allow you to be my disciple.`
` ...Will you call me Master?"`
`"Yes, Master."`
`"That's a good answer.`
` Then from now on, learn the depths of magic along with me.`
` I am also in training.`
` Let us both learn magic the right way, and do our best to reach that blissful level."`
`"Yes, Master...!"`
`"........................`
` ...Ah, a dream.`
` ......That face brings me back..."`
`Endless Witch, was it?`
`A name that I had yearned for in the past as the highest achievement...now just another one of my titles.`
`No, you can even call it a name.`
`"...Every once in a while, it's nice to feel some satisfaction from that name.`
` Isn't it something that I gained as the result of many days of training?"`
`"...It's a little bit of a waste if I don't feel some gratitude for it every once in a while.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`I shook my head lightly.`
`If it is called the highest level, that means that there is nothing higher.`
`{n}An eternal dead end, the beginning of eternal boredom.`
`"Master said it once.`
` That when one is released from all sadness, it is the same as eternal bliss.`
` ......Which is why I think...`
`Master {i:couldn't reach that level}."`
`Eternal bliss means eternal boredom.`
`{n}...That's the beginning of eternal torture.`
`But perhaps all things depend on your point of view.`
`Eternal boredom is the same as a sketchbook that doesn't run out of pages.`
` It means you can draw whatever you want, can put in as much effort to enjoy it as you want.`
`Boredom is the worst poison that kills all witches.`
`......To the Great Witches who hold the title "Lady", this is frighteningly true.`
`{n}It is the eternal poison that tortures them because of the eternal bliss that they have reached...`
`"Now that I have earned the name of Endless Witch, I truly wish to speak with my master again.`
` ......Was the result of our training really "happiness"?`
` And I want to talk with her about what true "happiness" is."`
`― Training has no end.`
` When you think you have reached the eternal level, that is the time to regret your immaturity.`
`......As if in answer to my own words, a memory of her saying something like that entered my mind.`
`"*cackle*cackle*, hahhahahahahahahahaha...`
` I see, ......I am immature, am I?!`
` How nice, how nice.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`Some painfully shrill laughter could be heard.`
`It was from my furniture.`
` ...Did they break their toy again?`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐samaaa.`
` This guy's stopped moving agaaain."`
`"Even though I haven't played enough at all.`
` What a pathetic man."`
`"I hadn't even played at alllll!`
` Let me play, let me playyyy!"`
`"Be silent, you filth!`
` No matter how well {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama fixes him, he just breaks right away, because you all devour him like starving dogs."`
`"You broke him the most, Satan‐nee.`
` 'Cause you don't know restraint."`
`"My apologies, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` Please forgive my cretinous younger sisters."`
`"Fix him quicklyyy!`
` I'm next, I'm neeext!"`
`"Can you not be silent, shut up!!"`
`"""""""Eeek!!"""""""`
`Just from that single yell, the noisy Sisters of the Seven Stakes disappeared and hid.`
`They just mess around, having as much fun as they want breaking him.`
`{n}They only come to me to clean up afterwards.`
`{n}...Good grief, my furniture doesn't let me get bored.`
`What remained after the pieces of furniture hid themselves...was just the sloppy mess that was all that remained of the broken toy.`
`It had no form anymore.`
`"...Even I find it hard to recall his original form when he looks like this.`
` It's better to make him remember for himself.`
` ......Oh, well."`
`I waved my golden pipe.`
`And I told.`
` I chanted.`
` I made it remember.`
`"......Come, try to remember.`
` What form did you have?`
` ...After all, right now, you look like nothing but a huge lump of scrap meat to me."`
`"I've no idea which parts are the arms and which parts are the legs.`
` If you don't remember for me, I won't even be able to recall your face.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`By the power of the magic, the pitiful pieces of meat began to remember what their form had been.`
`Who was connected to who.`
` Where was joined up with where.`
`That's right, just like that.`
`...No, no, you should be a finger on the left hand.`
` And you, the right hand.`
` That's it, good, good, *cackle*.`
`"...Good morning.`
` Feeling awake, Ushiromiya Battler?`
` How truly ironic that being awake is even more like a nightmare."`
`".........*cough*, ...*cough*...`
` .........eck, ...owowow......"`
`"If you would just accept that I am a witch, you'll quickly awaken from this nightmare, and I'll send you to heaven.`
` I am the king of Mount Purgatory.`
` There's no way out of this hell without my approval."`
`"Heh, ...heheheheh.`
` You call this hell? That's no good.`
` Yeah, that's no goddamn good at all."`
`"The pain of death, which humans only have to taste once,`
` has been given to you more times than I could count with all of my fingers, and yet, ...how can you keep talking like that?`
` *cackle*!`
` That is why I never tire.`
` I never tire of you."`
`"Yeah, I'm not tiring either.`
` I mean, I get to pick and choose from those busty babes with dazzling asses in my harem.`
` Thanks to that, I'm not getting tired at all."`
`"*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` I am glad to hear it.`
` Otherwise I too would be bored.`
` So, my furniture.`
` I've fixed him, so you can play as much as you want."`
`"Thank you very much!`
` Kyaha, dibs!"`
`"Didn't I say you're done, you're done, I'm next!`
` Back off, waaah!"`
`"Huhuhuhuhu.`
` Wonderful, isn't it, Battler‐kuuun?`
` You're so popular, aren't you?"`
`"It's hard being a popular guy.`
` Get in line, you beasts."`
`"If you stopped acting all tough and started being honest with yourself, this would be much easier on you."`
`"It's alright like this.`
` His screams feel so much better this way."`
`"Alright, let's not break him easily this time.`
` Well?! Do you hear me?!"`
`"You aren't in control!"`
`"So, Battler‐kun.`
` Let's continue where we left off, alright?`
` After locking Jessica‐chan's room with the master key, how did they return the key to the pocket of the corpse which was inside the room?"`
`"......For example...`
` ...That's it, they used a fishing line or something, and just the key went back into the room through the crack of the door..."`
`"Kyahhahahahahahaha!!`
` Wronnng!"`
`"So naive.`
` {p:1:Of all of the doors that exist on Rokkenjima, none has a crack through which a key can slip}."`
`"He got it wrong? He got it wrong?!`
` Right, this time me, my turn!`
` Wherrre should I strike!"`
`"Me, back of the hand!"`
`"Gh...!!"`
`"That's meeeean!`
` Then, the back of the other hand!"`
`"Gwoaaahhh...!!"`
`"I'll take the tip of the nose!"`
`"Ga...gagah......!!"`
`"Why, why, let me do it too, let me strike too!`
` Waaah!!"`
`"You're just slow, Levia‐nee, "you snooze you lose" has always been how we've done things!`
` Then, I'll take the top of his foot!"`
`"Ugwaahh......!!"`
`"Waaah!!`
` Me too, me toooo!`
` Fine, I don't care, I'll take his shoulder!"`
`"Ga...hahh......!!"`
`"Keh...`
` You're sisters, right? Be nice to each other. ...`
`...Gwaaa, ......oh, .........hh..."`
`"......How can you withstand that?`
` Why haven't you realized that your false courage actually makes us more excited?"`
`"Too bad.`
` False courage and being stubborn are my specialty.`
` No matter how you all try to speak in riddles, I definitely won't accept witches and magic...!"`
`"Even though you can't explain anything with human tricks?`
` Are you a moron?!`
` Know your place!"`
`"It's alright, we don't have to force him to accept it.`
` Any moment now he'll break down crying with the desire to accept it.`
` Even now, he really wants to kneel down on the ground pitifully and beg our forgiveness!"`
`"Ugaah, guahgehgehgyahh...!!"`
`"Aahhhh, he's broken already!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐samaaa!"`
`"......Dear me.`
` Since they know that I can revive him over and over, my pieces of furniture don't even hesitate to break him.`
` How troublesome."`
`Endless rebirths give me free reign over endless deaths, too.`
` Before the Endless Witch {f:5:Beatrice}, all death and life has no meaning.`
`Even death can't serve as the key to escape from my cage.`
`"So, Battler.`
` Remember your original form once more.`
` I'll toy with you over and over again!"`
`"I see, I see, it truly is pleasant to have a toy to play with for all eternity.`
` ......I see, could this be the endless bliss witches gain at the endless level?"`
`"I see, I see.`
` This certainly is a pleasant bliss.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Wahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` I'll revive you over and over, kill you over and over!"`
`"Now then, what kind of murder spree shall I unleash on the next game board?`
` Come, bring the new game board. Why don't we begin the next game, Ushiromiya Battler!!"`
`"Sheesh.`
` Aneki's hatred of cigarettes is a real pain in the neck."`
`"Sorry.`
` She's been grumpy since last night.`
` Think you could let it slide?"`
`Rudolf and Hideyoshi went out onto the deck, and took out some cigarettes.`
`Eva had always hated the smell of cigarettes, but when she was in a bad mood, she got even more oversensitive.`
`The two of them had attempted to spend some relaxed time smoking until they made it to the island, but they had gotten yelled at and chased out onto the deck.`
`Hideyoshi tried to use his lighter, but it didn't go well with all of the strong winds on the deck.`
`{n}Rudolf took out a Zippo with a stylish gesture, and let Hideyoshi borrow the flame.`
`"When did you start smoking, Hideyoshi nii‐san?"`
`"Just after the war.`
` In the beginnin', I was rollin' 'em.`
` Then I started usin' what I was sellin'.`
` Wahahahahahahaha."`
`"So you were already smoking when you met Aneki.`
` I'll bet she's always telling you to stop."`
`"I never listened to her, so she's already completely given up on that.`
` Wahaha, looks like men've gotta be stubborn."`
`Hideyoshi laughed heartily, but Rudolf chuckled.`
`After being scolded by Eva and told to smoke outside, they had dejectedly fled to the deck together.`
` There was almost no doubt he was under her thumb.`
`"...She isn't usually so short‐tempered.`
` ......Nah, she's usually a more gentle, quiet woman.`
` Every year, she changes when this day comes."`
`"Is that so?`
` To me, she looks just like the Aneki we've all known for so long."`
`"......That's right.`
` She goes back to bein' Eva of the Ushiromiya family.`
` ...But, that's different from the Eva who's with me."`
`"..................`
` Well, I can understand why she's grumpy.`
` ...This family conference is going to be a pain."`
`"......Sure is.`
` ...That plan to threaten money out of Krauss nii‐san.`
` It's a family conference only in name, really it's just a fight between siblings."`
`With the family conference ahead of them, the three siblings excluding Krauss had made a secret contract.`
`Each of them had a pressing situation to deal with, and urgently needed a lot of money.`
`And the only one who could help them was Krauss, who spoke for the Ushiromiya head, since Kinzo was shut up in his study.`
`They had long felt that Krauss had started taking advantage of Kinzo's loss of interest in his own wealth,`
` and was embezzling that wealth for his own use.`
`When everything had been going well for the siblings, even though they had found it detestable, they had pretended not to notice,`
` ...but now that they needed money, they couldn't just quietly accept that.`
`Eva had called Rudolf and Rosa into an alliance, and they were planning to exploit that knowledge in order to draw money out of Krauss...`
`".........Rudolf‐kun, both you and I are company presidents.`
` We are responsible for the livelihood of our employees."`
`"Rosa is a president too.`
` Well, as a hobby."`
`"That's right, sorry.`
` ......In short, all of us are bearin' some burden."`
`"...Now that I've thrown the gauntlet down in front of the executive board, I gotta bring in the money, even if it means I have to grovel or even drink mud."`
`"Same here.`
` ...I can't betray my employees who've trusted me and followed me for so long.`
` ......That's why I gotta get some money out of Krauss nii‐san, even if I have to grab him by the neck."`
`"Aneki has always been at odds with Aniki.`
` ...And now she has to have a full‐on confrontation with him.`
` That's probably enough to make her grumpy."`
`"So, Eva has always been on bad terms with Krauss nii‐san, then...?"`
`"She doesn't talk to you about it?`
` Definitely, yeah, in a really big way."`
`"She won't tell me about the past even if I ask.`
` ......She probably doesn't want to remember."`
`"...Aneki has always been smart and shrewd.`
` Her grades were good too.`
` Compared to that, Aniki was just average.`
` ...Her just being there beside him should have been enough pressure, but Aneki kept boasting about it and driving Aniki into a corner."`
`"......Silly girl...`
` Why be openly hostile like that and drive him into a corner?`
` That's not bein' shrewd."`
`"Hahaha, seriously."`
`".........Aneki regretted being born a woman.`
` ...She probably couldn't forgive Aniki for getting to succeed the head just because he was a man.`
` ...So she'd always take every opportunity to boast to Dad that she was superior."`
`"Father really is an old‐fashioned person.`
` His values discriminate between men and women.`
` ...You think that Father disliked Eva a bit, since she likes to make herself conspicuous...?"`
`"..........................."`
`"Don't you think that schooling for women is like sugar in black tea?`
` Without it, it is bland, but too much of it ruins the tea."`
`...Since you can still drink black tea without sugar,`
` it was exactly the same as saying that study was unnecessary for a woman.`
`Those infuriating words were ones that my older brother had abused me with when I had been in despair, wanting to go to college but denied by Father.`
`I had protested that advancing to college was essential if I was to acquire the education and class befitting the eldest daughter of the Ushiromiya family.`
`But the replies I received from Father and my brother were, in summary, exactly the same.`
`"How conceited for a woman."`
`Since the time I was born into the Ushiromiya family, I hadn't taken that name lightly even once.`
` And furthermore, nor had I ever taken lightly Father's name, Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
`It was an old family with a long history, but it had lost all its wealth and its business in the Great Kanto Earthquake, and almost sank for a time.`
` Then Father, with his ingenious talent, had taken control, and revived it to be even greater than it had been before.`
`I hadn't forgotten even once what it meant to be the daughter of that great Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
`Therefore, I had always made every effort to become worthy of that name.`
`Class worthy of the Ushiromiya family.`
` Schooling.`
` Manners.`
` And leadership.`
`Even if I was far from reaching Father's level, I deepened my knowledge in economics and finance, and tried to improve myself so that I could help out with that at any time.`
`......However, in the end, there never came a time when Father acknowledged that.`
`To Father, a woman was only meant to support a man, and nothing further than that was permissible.`
`I wonder when it was that I understood that.`
`{n}......I probably understood ever since I was a young girl.`
`...But to truly accept it, I had to wait until I had grown up.`
`Compared to my own effort, you couldn't have said that Krauss, as my older brother by two years,`
` tried at all to become deserving of the Ushiromiya family name.`
`Ever since we were young, my brother kept saying that it was natural that he'd succeed Father, just because he was born a man.`
`...He kept repeating that, as though it were an absolute gap between us.`
`I couldn't stand it.`
` Even though I always got better grades than my brother,`
` even though I became class president while he was stuck as vice‐president of his class,`
` ...even so, my brother was considered to be the appropriate person to succeed the Ushiromiya family, just because he was a man.`
`Of course, you could get away with gender discrimination in those days.`
`{n}No, it was even considered a virtue in those days.`
`It was a time when women were looked down upon, and it was said that when a woman is born, she is to obey her parents; when she gets married, she is to obey her husband; and when she gets old, she is to obey her children.`
`But because that way of thinking existed, I wanted to overturn it.`
`{n}......Innocently, I kept trying to prove that I was the most fit.`
`......However, eventually, I realized that all of my efforts were doomed from the beginning.`
`"Don't you think that schooling for women is like sugar in black tea?`
` Without it, it is bland, but too much of it ruins the tea."`
`"...What do you mean by that, Nii‐san?"`
`"In the same way that there are things that only men can do, there are also things that only women can do, are there not?`
` I think things like giving birth to children, raising them, and supporting their husband can only be done by women."`
`"Are you trying to say that there's no need for a woman to do things like work and study?"`
`"I wouldn't go that far.`
` Unschooled women are tiring just to talk to.`
` ...However, women who are too smart are even more tiring.`
` I think that a woman like you, who vehemently asserts herself, would cause her future husband a lot of trouble."`
`"Are you trying to say that a woman must marry and stay in the shadow of their husband?`
` That's none of your business!"`
`"I admire you as my little sister for feeling that you should respect Father and become a proper daughter for him.`
` Even I can respect that."`
`"Disgusting.`
` What is this {ruby:neutral/polite "I":"watashi"}?`
` You've always used {ruby:rough/casual "I":"ore"}.`
` Are you already pretending to be the head?"`
`"It was decided that {i:{ruby:watashi:I}} would succeed the head from the beginning.`
` And yet you seem to be laboring under the illusion that you can become the head, and have just been making useless and reckless attempts to do that."`
`"Reckless attempts, you say...?!`
` Is my saying that I want to go to college really that odd?!"`
`"Yes, it's odd.`
` Indeed, you are the eldest daughter of the glorious Ushiromiya family.`
` Eventually, you will bear the responsibility of that family crest, and be wed to the partner who is most valuable for Father."`
`"...However, what will be demanded of you then is not an excess of knowledge.`
` It is gentle feelings to care for your husband and ability in housework, and it is a humble demeanor that will support the master of your household.`
` You are completely lacking in all of those things.`
` In the end, is that really proper for a daughter of the Ushiromiya family?"`
`"I have no intention of being a secluded daughter!`
` I just want to become the best person who can help Father with his work!"`
`"In which case, should you not be aiming to become worthy as a daughter of the Ushiromiya family...?`
` What is it with you?`
` Even at this age, you still act like a man, you are careless with housework and cooking, and you never wear any makeup to please men.`
` Recently I've heard that you've even been training to learn how to brawl."`
`"Th‐that's rude!!`
` It isn't brawling, the martial arts are the perfect training for the mind.`
` And at the proper time, I can act like a woman well enough!!`
` What are you trying to say?`
` That women should be slaves who work for men, that women must not step out in front, is that what you're trying to say?!"`
`"It isn't elegant to admit that,`
` but in order to correct your mistake, I think that a few unpleasant words are necessary.`
` So let me say it plainly.`
` Women exist to serve men.`
` And men exist to cultivate women.`
` A woman's job is to protect a man's back, to protect their house and raise their children."`
`"Normally, they don't have to be told that to realize it.`
` They realize it by themselves.`
` ...But no matter how old you get, you haven't realized that about yourself.`
` So as your brother, I will clear away that misunderstanding for you before you exit this house into society.`
` You should thank me."`
`"Th‐that is an insult to all women...!!`
` No, ...wait, ...I, I have never thought of myself as a woman, I've never depended on anyone because I'm a woman!!"`
`"How am I inferior to you, Nii‐san?!`
` In grades, in accomplishments, I'm better than you in everything, so how can you look down on me when you don't have anything I don't, except being a man?!!"`
`"It's about whether or not you know your place.`
` Every day, I have been raised so that I would be prepared to be the next head.`
` In the future, that will definitely be essential.`
` But you are different.`
` Even though you will marry and lose the Ushiromiya family name, you keep seeing this illusion that you don't need to see."`
`"......What are you so unsatisfied about?`
` Even if you were born as a man, it still wouldn't be you who would succeed the head.`
` What's so unsatisfying that you keep attacking me?"`
`"What's so unsatisfying, you say?!?!`
` Nii‐san, you are always, always,`
` ......always always always...!`
` You claim yourself as the successor, look down on me,`
` ......and despite that...`
`......urrrrrrrgggggggggg!!"`
`What's so unsatisfying, he says...?`
`A billion grudges, hard feelings, humiliations that I'll never forget crossed through the back of my mind.`
`And all of them built up at the same time, coming out of my throat as nothing more than a shameful moan.`
`"......What is all this noise.`
` God isn't the only one who values silence."`
`"Father."`
`"Father!"`
`Our sibling fight was probably overheard.`
`{n}Father entered with a clearly displeased face.`
`"Krauss.`
` Are you fighting with your siblings again?`
` Why do you not have the dignity to lead your siblings?`
` How shameful!`
` You are a joke of an eldest son!"`
`In a flash, he struck Krauss's face.`
`...I prepared myself to be struck in the same way, but I wasn't hit.`
`"M‐......my apologies,`
` Father."`
`"Dignity isn't the only thing that you lack.`
` There's much more.`
` You're immature in everything!`
` And even so, you pretend like you're an adult!`
` Realize that it's a hundred years too early for you to talk like that, and devote yourself to your studies!`
` Don't make me lament my son's incompetence any more...!"`
`"Yes.`
` ...I will continue to strive so that I can become a person worthy to succeed you, Father..."`
`It was as if those words were directed at me.`
`Even when he was being yelled at by Father, he was still bragging to me about how he was special,`
` ......about how he was the successor.`
`I just couldn't stand it, and finally spoke what was on my mind.`
`Even though I realized that this was improper for a person of the Ushiromiya family.`
`"Father...!!`
` Please tell me, how am I inferior?!!`
` Until today I've tried so hard, studied so hard to become a person who would not shame your name...!"`
`"Please, tell me, in what way am I inferior...?!`
` How can I improve myself so that you will accept me...!!"`
`"Are you still talking about that?!!`
` How many times do I have to tell you?`
` I have no expectations for you whatsoever!`
` A woman should just learn cooking and sewing, like a woman!!`
` You have none of the necessary attitude of a woman!`
` I can't sense any of the disposition needed to serve a husband, the heart to devote yourself to a man!!"`
`"What good are you as a woman!`
` Do you realize that you are a daughter of the Ushiromiya family!!`
` And yet, the only thing you want to learn is how to act like a man!`
` Your duty is not to act like Krauss!!`
` Do you even understand your own duty?!!"`
`"A‐as a person of the Ushiromiya family, I won't embarrass your na—"`
`"That's it, right there you're already wrong!!`
` Your duty is to marry {i:out} of the family, and bring me a man who is profitable to me!`
` And then devote yourself to your husband, be fruitful and multiply!`
` Be a good wife who brings praise to your husband's family!!"`
`"What can you do that is capable of pleasing a man?`
` Do you think you can make tea?`
` Do you have any talent in cooking?`
` You have nothing!!"`
`"All you have done is to try to act like Krauss!!`
` Krauss will succeed the Ushiromiya family!`
` If you are unsatisfied with that, then you are disobeying me!!"`
`"Are you saying that you won't even listen to what I say, even though you're my daughter!!!`
` Get out!!`
` You're disinherited!!`
` I won't let you use the name Ushiromiya!!`
` Disinherited disinherited!!`
` Uuug, *cough*cough*!!"`
`"Father, stay strong.`
` Please calm down.`
` ......Genji‐san, could you bring some water?"`
`"......Yes.`
` Immediately."`
`"Eva, leave this place.`
` He doesn't mean what he says.`
` I will calm him down."`
`"*cough*, *cough*cough*!!`
` Disinherited, if you won't listen to me, you're disinherited!!`
` *cough**cough*, uug, *hack*cough**cough*!!"`
`As Father struggled with a fit of heavy coughs, my brother patted his back.`
`...As if that were naturally his duty.`
`{n}It was so vexing for me then to let him monopolize that duty.`
`If I approached Father carelessly, I would probably be hit again.`
`...However, I fearlessly tried to approach Father's back.`
`Genji blocked me...`
`"......Eva‐sama, it would probably be better if you stepped outside for now.`
` The Master is not in a good mood today."`
`"B‐but......"`
`"*cough*cough*!!"`
`"Why are my children so incompetent?!`
` Krauss is lacking in dignity, Eva never moves on from being a stubborn tomboy!!`
` I have no manly son, not even a womanly daughter!"`
`"Where did I go wrong raising them?!`
` Why Genji, when and where and how did I go wrong?!!"`
`"......My lord, you have done nothing wrong.`
` Krauss‐sama has grown into a sturdy son, and Eva‐sama into a lovely daughter.`
` You haven't made any mistakes..."`
`"In what way!!`
` In what way is {i:she} lovely?!!`
` Far from a lady, she's always acting like a man!!`
` *cough*cough*cough*!!`
` Disinherited, disinheriteddd!!`
` *cough*cough*!!"`
`"Father, I was just warning Eva about that very thing.`
` Eva, too, promised that she would have a change of heart and begin acting like a lady.`
` Couldn't you postpone that for just a little longer?"`
`"Lady, my foot!!`
` *cough*cough*!!`
` Disinherited disinherited... *cough*cough*, uugg, *hack*hack*!"`
`Go quickly and I'll handle this for you.`
`Krauss gave me a look telling me that...`
`......Did I take the wrong path, just like Father and my brother had said?`
`They were right that I had never studied how to be a lady.`
`{n}...Everything I had learned was because I'd hoped that I could help Father someday.`
`.........Wait, was that really the case?`
`Hadn't I always held a growing sense of rivalry with my brother, with whom I'd had a bad relationship since I was a young girl,`
` and wasn't I just trying to get the better of him by stealing his position as successor to the head?`
`Every time, my brother told me that men should be manly and women should be womanly.`
`I had been tormented by this unreasonable discrimination because of my sex, something I was born with and couldn't do anything about.`
`I had resisted, had endeavored to study until today so that I could prove that I wasn't inferior, even though I was a woman.`
`...In that case, wasn't the basis of my love of learning just a boring inferiority complex toward my brother?`
`Father had expected me to be a lady with whom he could go out in public and not be embarrassed.`
`...Had I betrayed that expectation and earned grades to intimidate my brother just to clear away that pent‐up resentment from my childhood...?`
`"That's not it.`
` You vowed to me that I would become the successor to the Ushiromiya family."`
`".........You........."`
`The one who came whispering to me.........was myself, born in my heart on the day I made that vow—myself on that day as a little girl.`
`...That's right.`
` "She" was my only ally.`
`Whenever I was suffering, whenever I felt like I could take no more, she would always quietly appear and take my side.`
`Whenever I found myself with my head in my hands, stumbling over difficult problems, she would always appear and support me.`
`As I had grown and forgotten my time as a girl, I'd also begun to forget my conversations with "her"...`
`"I, Ushiromiya Eva, will definitely become the head of the Ushiromiya family.`
` And I'll triumph over that irritating, arrogant Krauss.`
` ...On that day, we promised to do our best together to achieve that."`
`"......That's right. We promised.`
` ...On that day, that I would become the successor to the head."`
`On that day, when I had been overcome with sadness, wondering why I was even alive,`
` ...you appeared inside me, and lent me your strength.`
`"......I wanted Father to accept me.`
` I wanted to get the better of my brother.`
` I believed that, if I could do that, I could forever part ways with that wretched part of myself."`
`In those days, I had really believed that I had no other purpose in life than to be looked down upon by my brother.`
`...It's painful just remembering those days.`
`{n}The wound, the tear that split open in my heart...`
`"She" taught me how to sew up that wound...`
`I would change my anger into effort and improve myself,`
` ......become a person more worthy to be head than Krauss was,`
` and triumph over him by making Father accept me—the perfect revenge.`
`I knew more or less that a woman couldn't succeed the head.`
`But if I could become so superior that I could overturn that,`
` ...then surely even Father would select me to be his successor.`
`If that happened, ......then I could have the greatest, ultimate, most perfect revenge against my brother,`
` who always acted like it was completely natural for him to succeed the head...`
`"Right.`
` If we do that, then the wounds in our heart will be healed.`
` ......We promised each other that we would do our best until that day came."`
`"And yet, you're breaking this promise?`
` Scum.`
` Coward.`
` Why not give up and die forever...?"`
`Even though she has the form of my young self, she is still another me.`
` ...And she has a sharp tongue—after all, she's me.`
`"...It really makes me mad hearing that from myself.`
` You have no right to speak of me like that."`
`"Then let's use that anger and learn from it.`
` ......Changing anger into power is my magic.`
` I've saved you from several predicaments with that power, and allowed you to achieve things that should have been impossible for you.`
` As long as you have my magic, there's nothing you can't do."`
`"......That's right.`
` Anger has always been my driving force.`
` I wonder when it was that I forgot that..."`
`"If you have remembered me again, that magic is ours once more.`
` Come on, let's turn that anger into power, and endeavor in our studies even more, alright?`
` I'm sure that we still have a lot more studying that we need to do."`
`"Let's go to college, study more and more, get excellent grades, and drive Krauss into a corner."`
`"That guy makes a face as though we're nothing, but I'm sure he feels pretty well cornered in his heart.`
` If only he would just learn his place and die.`
` If he did, we could become the head.`
` Rudolf will be nice enough to decline.`
` That kid can't go against us."`
`".........Stop that.`
` ...Even if I study more, Father still won't accept me."`
`"Why...?"`
`"Father is telling me to be womanly...`
` No matter how hard I try, as long as I'm a woman, Father will never pass on the headship to me... even if I'd been born before Nii‐san..."`
`"No matter how much effort I put in, ......I can't become anything more than a woman.`
` I won't be accepted.`
` I can't surpass Nii‐san, who doesn't try at all.`
` I will always be looked down upon..."`
`"...Father and Krauss are the worst kind of male supremacists.`
` I wish they'd just fucking die already."`
`......She would curse in my place.`
`Words that I couldn't say carelessly, ...she would say for me.`
`...Even though I understood that she was just another part of myself inside of me,`
` ...I felt like she was the only ally I had who would sympathize with me.`
`However, while sympathy might calm my heart somewhat, it wouldn't do anything to improve my current situation.`
` ......In the end, she could only console me when I was dejected by reality, and for the amount of time I needed to accept it.`
`"......Thank you.`
` That's enough, now.`
` ...Now that it's come to this, I'll become such a good lady that I'll surprise Father...`
` I'll find an excellent man that Nii‐san can't even be compared with—"`
`"No, that's no good."`
`"............"`
`"She" rejected my timid thoughts.`
`...I know why.`
`{n}......Because "she" is me, I know why.`
`"Father says, or at least {i:right now} he says, that he won't let a woman succeed the head.`
` But that's never been anything more than a rule that Father decided on.`
` Since Father decided on it, he can abolish it."`
`".........People's feelings can change many more times than there are grains of sand on a beach.`
` Even if we don't prove that Krauss is a stupid man, Father will eventually realize it."`
`"...At that time, the ridiculous wall that separates man from woman will be demolished by Father, who set it up in the first place.`
` That day will surely come."`
`"......How can you say surely?"`
`"Because that is my...magic."`
`"....................."`
`"If you'll just believe, this magic will surely create a miracle.`
` ......The basis of my magic is nothing more than your believing heart."`
`"..........................."`
`If I can use that magic, ......then surely, until the day I die, I'll never have to doubt that someday I will become the head.`
`...But I don't know if that is the right thing for Ushiromiya Eva...`
`Shouldn't I aim to become the kind of lady that Father hoped for, someone he can take out into society and boast about?`
`Father might take a better view of me if I were reborn.`
` ......Maybe my brother could find his own lifestyle, and I could find mine.`
`Besides, no matter what, I just can't imagine that my father, stubborn as he is, would not only allow a woman to succeed the head,`
` but also skip my older brother and select me for the headship.`
`".........You don't believe?"`
`"U‐...um, I was...just thinking.`
` .........Maybe I can't succeed the head, but, as a woman, I can have a child. And Nii‐san still isn't engaged."`
`"......If Nii‐san doesn't manage to have children, and I do, ...then wouldn't the next head after Nii‐san be my child?`
` Wouldn't that basically...mean the same thing as stealing the headship from Nii‐san...?"`
`"............Are you serious?"`
`"Y‐...yes. I'm serious.`
` ......It will indeed be quite sad to throw away the determination from my years as a young girl.`
` ...It will pain my heart to betray you, my younger self.`
` ......But this way is the most realistic...!"`
`In that moment, my body changed, and I was no longer myself from back then, but as I am now: a "wife" and "mother".`
`Yes......this is a "dream".`
` Even so, "she" still possessed the same ambition and desire as always, and she argued back, with her expression displaying clear displeasure at this change.`
`"Are you throwing away your dreams?`
` ......And are you even throwing me away?"`
`"I'm not throwing anything away.`
` ......It's just that I've become an adult, and the time has come for us to go our separate ways."`
`"That's right.`
` You've already become an adult.`
` You've even forgotten how to use magic.`
` ......You are now the mother of a child.`
` You've forgotten the magic that can grant your own dreams, and are now pushing those dreams onto your son."`
`"...Even though you had your own life messed with so much by Father and Krauss, you're trying to push your dreams onto your son, and mess with his life too.`
` ......Is that what being an adult is all about?"`
`"G‐George is my pride and joy, who won't embarrass me no matter where he goes...!`
` The dream that wasn't granted me might be granted to George...!`
` Jessica's grades and behavior aren't good at all.`
` And she's a woman!`
` If only Jessica would step down, George could become the heir...!"`
`My heart pained even as I said it.`
`Aren't I just forcing my own regrets onto George?`
`I don't have any right to disparage Jessica.`
` And to hit her with the same words that had caused me so much suffering is just horrible...`
`...I understand.`
` I understand...`
`Wanting to triumph over my brother was nothing more than my personal revenge.`
`{n}...I mustn't use George for that...`
`"......So I'll take revenge myself.`
` I have a plan to cheat Nii‐san out of some of his money, with Rudolf and Rosa as my allies.`
` I'll surely be able to get back at him.`
` ...I mean, there's no doubt that Nii‐san is embezzling Father's assets..."`
`"...What a boring plan.`
` Why don't you just give that up and cry yourself to sleep forever...?"`
`"..........................."`
`"We will become the head of the Ushiromiya family.`
` ......Don't try to confuse that dream.`
` So believe me that you can definitely achieve it.`
` Believe in my magic."`
`"...If I believe, will the magic have power, I wonder."`
`"Yes.`
` My magic can grant any wish without fail."`
`"..................`
` ......I'll believe.`
` ......I'll believe, ...so create a miracle with that magic...`
` ......If you don't, ......the hole in my heart will never heal......"`
`"Yes.`
` ......Then, listen well.`
` To my magic words.`
` ......And understand them. If we can solve the riddle, we can become the Ushiromiya family head.`
` ......So lend me your ears and listen carefully..."`
`Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old.`
`{n}You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key......`
`"Eva nee‐san.`
` It looks like we're about to arrive."`
`As her shoulder was tapped by Kyrie, Eva jumped and awoke from her doze.`
`".........nh.`
` .........Ah,`
` ......I'm sorry.`
` I was half asleep."`
`"Sorry for surprising you."`
`"Auntie Eva, you were out cold.`
` Did you get up early this morning?"`
`"......I suppose.`
` How embarrassing, I must have looked quite disgraceful.`
` I'm sorry."`
`"Pretty impressed that you're relaxed enough to sleep, though?`
` Not like Battler, he's been yelling the whole time about how he's gonna "falllll" and "drowwwwn"!`
` Can't get bored with this dude around."`
`"Sh‐shut up!`
` Everyone has one or two things they don't like...!"`
`Battler and Jessica went back out, squabbling merrily.`
`{n}Rudolf also made a face as if asking, "Are you alright?".`
`"Get ahold of yourself.`
` When you see the faces of Dad and the rest, all that sleepiness'll go right out the window.`
` Let's do our best to stay firm, alright?"`
`"...That's right.`
` We have to stay firm, especially this year..."`
`"That's it.`
` ...Let's tense up our assholes and do this thing."`
`Rudolf said these strict words in a small voice that only Eva could hear.`
`Failure would not be tolerated in this year's family conference.`
`{n}......All of their companies were hanging in the balance.`
`Even Rudolf's face looked a little tense.`
`{n}Eva's expression probably looked tense as well.`
`"Mother, I have our luggage.`
` Let's go up onto the deck."`
`"...Thank you.`
` You really are thoughtful, George."`
`"Why are you thanking me so suddenly?`
` It's not like you, Mother."`
`"Evaaa, Geoorge.`
` We've arrived.`
` Gather our luggage."`
`"Uu!`
` Arrived, arrived!`
` *giggle*giggle*!"`
`"Hey, Maria!`
` You'll fall, so stop running!"`
`It seemed Maria was already getting excited.`
` She ran circles around Hideyoshi, escaping from Rosa, who was trying to catch her.`
`"{e:070:.........belove..................key......}{e:100:"}`
`"What is it, Mother?`
` ...Do you feel sick...?"`
`"George.`
` Take the luggage and go on ahead.`
` Your mother's probably anemic, so I'll lend her a hand."`
`"Really...?`
` I understand, I'll go on ahead."`
`By looking at Eva's peculiar expression, Hideyoshi realized that it had not been a pleasant awakening, and made George go on ahead.`
`Rudolf's family and Rosa's family also went up onto the deck, leaving only Eva and Hideyoshi inside the boat.`
`Eva had a vague expression on her face, as though she still hadn't been able to escape from her daydream.`
`"..........................."`
`"...What's wrong?`
` Why the meek face?"`
`".........I...wonder if I've been using George as a tool for my own revenge...`
` ...I wonder if my childish hostility towards Nii‐san has caused me to treat that boy's life like a toy...`
` Aah, what have I done... What have I......!"`
`"That isn't true.`
` George is our wonderful son, and he'll always perform admirably wherever he goes.`
` Even if your own ends got a little mixed in, everything's turned out alright in the end, hasn't it?!"`
`"You haven't done aaaanything wrong.`
` To the contrary, George is thankful for how you've been strictly disciplinin' him, right?"`
`"...Really?`
` Hey, really?!`
` I wonder, doesn't George think I'm a horrible mother...?!`
` Doesn't he, doesn't he doesn't he doesn't he?!"`
`"He's never said anythin' like that, not even once.`
` That's just your needless anxiety."`
`"Hideyoshi‐sama.`
` Everyone has left the boat, you know.`
` ......Oh, did you drop something?`
` Shall I help you?"`
`Kumasawa had come to check on them when they hadn't come up to the deck.`
`Hideyoshi hid Eva behind his back so that her expression couldn't be seen.`
`"Yeah, sorry.`
` My necktie pin just got a little crooked!`
` We're alright, and we'll be out in a second.`
` Wait outside for us!"`
`"Is that so?`
` ......Hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` Then I will wait outside..."`
`From that almost incomprehensible excuse, Kumasawa realized that something had come up, and disappeared so that she didn't trouble them further.`
`If they stayed here any longer, they would probably make everyone else worry too.`
`"...It's about time to go.`
` We'll make George and the rest worry."`
`"............Am I......really not despised by George......?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Nothin' of the sort.`
` In fact, he's very grateful."`
`".............................."`
`"...Did you have a bad nightmare?`
` Again?"`
`"..................`
`Yes."`
`Hideyoshi knew that it wasn't rare for Eva to be tormented by nightmares.`
`And they would always become more striking on the days leading up to the family conference...`
`Hideyoshi knew that Eva's relationship with Krauss was still so full of antagonism that it could even be called trauma,`
` and that she still couldn't separate herself from how she'd felt as a child.`
`"That was a dream.`
` ...I'm with you now.`
` If I grasp your hand tightly like this, that dream'll go flyin' away."`
`"Right?`
` Look.`
` Squeeeeze."`
`"......*giggle*.`
` That hurts.`
` ...Thank you.`
` I'm fine now...`
` ...Let's get off the boat."`
`"Yeah.`
` Let's get off the boat.`
` Everyone's waitin' for us."`
`"...Umm, ..................I'm sorry."`
`"Hmm?"`
`"......I'm sorry...`
`...that I yelled at you...`
`...about the smoke from your cigarettes just now......"`
`"C'mon, you normally wouldn't apologize for that sorta thing.`
` ...You go all frail after you've had a bad dream.`
` ...Don't worry about it.`
` I was wrong for not realizin' that the smoke was affectin' you."`
`"............Have you...started to hate me...?"`
`"No way, no way.`
` Wahahahahahaha.`
` If I hated you after somethin' like that, we would'na lasted three days.`
` C'mon, stand up, stand up.`
` Off we go, off we go."`
`"Hideyoshi‐sama, Eva‐sama.`
` Is everything alright?`
` Are you not feeling well?"`
`This time, Gohda had come.`
` It looked like they had kept everyone waiting too long after all.`
`Eva also stood up without grumbling this time.`
` ...She couldn't keep on forcing her bad mood onto her husband and causing him more trouble.`
`......Because that was not something a "good wife" would do.`
`"Is everything alright?`
` If you are worried about your health, shall I call Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"Thanks.`
` I'm just a little anemic.`
` I'm alright now."`
`"Just her hormones.`
` Don't worry about it.`
` Wahhahahahahaha."`
`"For goodness' sake...`
` Don't say stuff like that in front of people, it's embarrassing."`
`"Ohhh, sorry, sorry."`
`Eva elbowed Hideyoshi in the gut.`
` By that time, her normal expression had returned, which allowed Hideyoshi to relax a little.`
`The bright sunlight outside was almost enough to really make a person go giddy.`
`A small plank was lowered to get off the boat, and Gohda was waiting there, smiling and ready to lend them a hand.`
`"Please, Eva‐sama.`
` Your hand."`
`"Thank you."`
`"Welcome to Rokkenjima."`
`{a:c:`
`Welcome back.}`
`"......Huh?"`
`When she left the boat, .........it seemed to Eva as though she had heard the voice of her young self saying welcome back.`
`No, it hadn't {i:seemed} that way.`
`{n}...Someone had {i:said} "welcome back" to her.`
`After becoming a shameless adult,`
` ...the voice of her young self was distant.`
`"What am I living for......?`
` ......What can I do...to release myself from this obsession......?"`
`Hideyoshi heard her talking to herself.`
`He drew Eva close to him by her shoulder, and just by his firmness, he communicated that there was no need to say anything more...`
`Maybe it was because the typhoon was getting closer.`
` The lively cries of the seagulls, which usually greeted them when they arrived, couldn't be heard at all...`
`"...Six years ago, you say?`
` I mean, six years, that's like the whole of elementary school, isn't it?`
` It's pretty unfair to ask me to remember, don't you think?"`
`"I agree.`
` Especially since we were so young; we've grown a lot in these six years.`
` Actually, if we hadn't been introduced, maybe we wouldn't have been able to remember you."`
`"You think?`
` I knew it was Battler right away.`
` After he opened his mouth, I was even more sure."`
`"Uu.`
` I met him for the first time.`
` Don't know about six years ago."`
`"That's natural.`
` You were only three, after all."`
`"When you say it like that, I'm the same.`
` I only knew Maria when she was three years old, and since she's grown so big, yeah, no wonder I didn't recognize her."`
`After lunch, we had all gone out to the beach to walk around, talk and take it easy enjoying ourselves.`
`Our parents appeared somehow on edge, and seemed to have things to catch up on, so we had decided to leave our seats.`
`...Just as you'd expect, since it had been six years, the conversation focused on me.`
`"Still, you've really gotten taller.`
` I won't call myself short, but anyway, your height surprised me."`
`"That's right. I remember well what Battler‐sama was like six years ago, but I was surprised even so."`
`"Totally.`
` I could never have imagined this from how Battler looked six years back."`
`"I'm surprised at how everyone remembers so much about six years ago.`
` My memory's all hazy."`
`"Not surprised.`
` I mean, you seemed to take a while even remembering us.`
` That hurts a bit, ya know?"`
`"Come on, this was six years ago, right?`
` It's ridiculous to ask me to remember...!"`
`"...So, you can't remember things that happened six years ago very well?`
` I can remember as clearly as if it was yesterday..."`
`"That's because your memory is good, Shannon.`
` I bet you remember well what kind of things Battler‐kun did and said six years ago, don't you?"`
`"Come to think of it, that's right.`
` Shannon's memory is surprisingly good when it comes to certain things."`
`"Uu.`
` I'm crappy at remembering.`
` Remember fun stuff well but horrible at boring stuff.`
` Uu."`
`We all laughed, saying that everyone was like that.`
`"Shannon.`
` By the way, what was Battler like six years ago?`
` Remember any interesting episodes?"`
`"Let's see.`
` ......I'm sure that he said something like this when he left.`
` "I'll be back... <See you again>.`
` I'll come for you riding a white horse.""`
`"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh,`
` doooooooon't, so embarrassiiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiing!!"`
`"Gyaaah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!!"`
`"I bet he did, I bet he did!`
` That's exactly what he was like, six years ago he was always full of those stupid lines!"`
`"Waaahahahahaha!!"`
`"Hahahaha.`
` It really does sound like something Battler‐kun would have said back then."`
`"Uu.`
` Embarrassing? Embarrassing?"`
`"......Yeah.`
` Horribly embarrassing..."`
`"Maria, I'm sure that when you are in middle school, you'll want to say embarrassing things like that...`
` When that happens, write it on the back of some leaflet first, and read it three times before you decide to say it out loud.`
` If you don't, you'll definitely regret it..."`
`"Still, everyone has to pass through that painful period...`
` That's right, that's how you know your place, learn shame, and become an adult.`
` Yes, this is a memory I want to disappear, the bittersweet kind of thing that everyone does in adolescence as they transition to becoming adults...`
` Aaaaarrggh..."`
`You see, I tend to let my mouth run wild without thinking too much, so I don't remember all the details of everything I say.`
`But when the contents are recited back to me afterwards, it's always something extremely embarrassing.`
`In recent years, I have finally come to understand this weakness, and have been working hard to refrain from such careless outbursts, but......`
`...It seems I was just born with the habit of speaking without thinking, and there isn't a whole lot I can do about it.`
`"Shanno~n, do you remember any other embarrassing things?"`
`"Yes, well... I remember various other things, but...`
`......since it looks like the person in question wants to forget them, I think I will refrain from saying any more..."`
`"To be blunt, there's nothing else I remembe~r.`
` Please don't remind meeee."`
`"...Uu.`
` Shannon's bullying Battler...?`
` Uu.`
` Bad.`
` Bullying is bad."`
`"Hahahahaha. She isn't really bullying him.`
` Let's leave it at that, okay?"`
`"But Shannon, you'll have tell me all about it sometime Battler‐kun isn't around.`
` It sounds pretty interesting."`
`"Yes, certainly."`
`"N‐noooo, you can't, Shannon‐chaaaaaaaaaan...!!"`
`For a while, George‐aniki teased me by pretending to ask Shannon‐chan for more of my embarrassing misspeaks.`
`George‐aniki was messing around teamed up with Shannon‐chan,`
` ......but he seemed, how to describe it, very candid and frank.`
`He was always frank with his cousins, but he usually took on a reserved, gentlemanly attitude when he came in contact with the servants.`
`...When I thought about it, I got the feeling that he was acting a little overly familiar, which seemed slightly weird.`
`Maria started scribbling in the sand with a stick,`
` and George‐aniki and Shannon‐chan joined in, which left me and Jessica off to the side, so I asked her secretively.`
`"......Hey, Jessica.`
` Is George‐aniki, ......umm, going out with Shannon‐chan?"`
`"Ooooh?`
` What the, how did you notice?!`
` Battler, you've got more of an eye for people than I thought."`
`"Huh, ...whaaaaaaah?!`
` I was just kidding— They're actually going out?!"`
`"Shhh!`
` Your voice is too loud!`
` ...They are actually keeping it secret for now, apparently, alright?`
` It'd be better if nobody heard about it, especially Auntie Eva."`
`"I, I see...`
` Love with a servant..."`
`"...Y‐yeah, but, since when?`
` Wowww, a lot can happen in six years......`
` But still, Aniki really is talented, and Shannon‐chan is kind and spirited...`
` ......They might be a pretty good match."`
`Actually, six years ago, I remember taking notice of her just a little bit.`
`So that's how it is... She really fits well with George‐aniki... Nothing I can do about that.`
` ...Goodbye, my fleeting first love of six years ago...`
`.........Which means that...my collection of embarrassing lines that Shannon‐chan just held back on...`
`...probably has something to do with that...`
` Aaaaaaaaaaarrghh, I can't take it...`
`"How long have they been going out?"`
`"That depends on what you call going out, but I'd say it's definitely been at least a year.`
` If you count the time before either of them confessed, it'd be several years, I guess."`
`Before I'd realized it, the two of them had separated themselves from the group, and were walking down the beach, talking about something.`
`......They looked calm,`
` and rather than a light relationship between two lovers, it looked like a more serious relationship, as though they were already engaged.`
`"......Six years...`
` That's a long‐ass time."`
`"What did these six years mean to me?`
` I've just gotten taller.`
` It was just a waste of time, six years I spent obstinately fighting with my dad."`
`"What about you, Battler?`
` Have you gotten a girlfriennnd?"`
`"Hmm, I wonder.`
` There's a lot of girls that I play with.`
` But I don't have that "special one" yet.`
` ......I'm probably just a kid.`
` I think it's more fun to be noisy with a large group of people than being alone with one person."`
`"Aah, that's so you, Battler.`
` But take your relationships with your female friends seriously."`
`"Girls can be scary with their communities and their wrong impressions, okay?`
` There could be some secret feud going on over you, and someone might be crying or being hurt without you noticing it, you know?"`
`"That's so weird.`
` I think I got the same bit of advice from one of the girls in my class just last week.`
` ......What's with that?`
` Why can't we all have fun together?`
` Do they all really want to find a special person that badly?"`
`"...It's probably because you've never had a partner like that, Battler.`
` Well, you'll probably run into a girl like that at some point.`
` Just gotta wait it out!"`
`"What?`
` It sounds almost like you've already found a partner like that.`
` What about you?`
` Have you gotten a boyfriend?"`
`"Huh?!`
` M‐me?!`
` No, err, wahahahahaha......"`
`"Come on, that reaction's so easy to understand...`
` From the looks of it, there's some boy who you're thinking about, but you haven't been able to confess that to him yet, something like that."`
`"N‐no, umm, that's not, umm, uh!`
` C‐cram it, jackass, who cares about me...!"`
`"You're the one who brought up this subject, why do you have to go and get mad at me?`
` Women are creatures who always ask questions, and yet, they almost never answer them.`
` What cruel creatures, seriously."`
`"......W‐well, okay, umm.`
` ...I did try...`
`...to confess once.`
` Well, umm, I struck out pretty badly."`
`"Did they say "Sorry"?"`
`"No, umm, ......`
`...well, umm, it was really one‐sided and they were just, like, taken aback, I guess...`
` It was like they didn't even view me that way."`
`"I can understand that.`
` You talk just like a man.`
` If you don't act a little more elegant, you won't be able to entice a man's heart, you know?"`
`"I‐i‐is it really...`
` ......Is the way I speak...`
`...really that bad?"`
`"...Hmm?`
` Well, uhh, how you talk isn't everything, but if someone like you, who usually talks badly,`
` suddenly started making an effort to talk nicely, umm, that takes courage, and that might really get some guys' hearts thumping, maybe."`
`"R‐really...?`
` I see......`
` ......Yeah..."`
`Jessica had suddenly started speaking meekly, and was faintly blushing.`
`...I see, even though her confession didn't go well, it looks like she still hasn't given up.`
`But yeah...I totally get that.`
` After seeing how close George‐aniki and Shannon‐chan have gotten, it's no wonder she'd start wanting a boyfriend.`
`Six years.`
` ...Those six years of puberty are pretty important, and they go by so fast.`
`With the typhoon approaching, the clouds had grown steadily grayer, and yet, even so, I had this really refreshing feeling.`
`...Maybe I'll start thinking more seriously about the opposite sex, more than just the size of their boobs...`
`"By the way,`
` I know George‐aniki is going out with a servant, Shannon‐chan.`
` ......Not you as well, right?"`
`"Huh, ...eeeeeeh?!?!`
` Wh‐wh‐wh‐wh‐why do you think that...?!"`
`"Come to think of it, that young kid Kanon‐kun, who greeted us in the rose garden.`
` You covered for him quite a bit just considering he was bad at talking, didn't you?"`
`"N‐no, that's not...`
` Wahahahaha, you're too suspicious...!!"`
`"Then tell me just this one thing.`
` Right now,`
` is the boy you're after somewhere within one kilometer?"`
`"W‐well, that's, umm, ...I, I, I dunno..."`
`Kanon‐kun is the only boy on this island now who could possibly become her boyfriend.`
` So judging by her reaction, I'm probably right on.`
`I don't think of the Ushiromiya family as a noble family, but...two people in love with servants...`
` I'd never have dreamed that two pairs of Romeo and Juliet would be right next to me...`
`Auntie Eva will probably become an obstacle to George‐aniki and Shannon‐chan's love.`
`If Auntie Eva learns that the partner of her only son, the apple of her eye, is {i:Shannon‐chan},`
` she'll probably scream at her with cries of wretched servant, homewrecker, and so forth.`
`And a relationship between Jessica and Kanon‐kun would probably be just as full of difficulties.`
`{n}Aunt Natsuhi also seemed the type to be strict about that kind of thing.`
`......After all, Jessica's husband would probably become the head of the Ushiromiya family in the future.`
` If that person had once been a servant working for the family, ......well, no doubt things would be complicated.`
`"Well, everyone finds their own way in love.`
` Who cares, as long as you find someone you enjoy being with?"`
`"Being with someone doesn't require any permission as long as the two people accept each other.`
` If you worry about your parents or your family, then you lose.`
` Don't forget that.`
` You can't go out with someone with half‐hearted feelings."`
`"...Heh...`
` I can't believe you're saying something so philosophical‐sounding when you've never ever been in love."`
`"Don't treat love like a matter of profit and loss.`
` It's about <heart>.`
` That's all I want to say.`
` Well then,`
` <see you again, have a nice day>."`
`"......Pf,`
` ...wahhahhahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` George nii‐san, Shanno~n, listen, listennn!`
` This guy, he's said another one of those lines!!"`
`"I didn't say anything, I didn't say anything!!`
` Waaah, don't make fun of me, don't make fun of me!!"`
`"I heard, I heard!`
` <See you aga~in>, <see you aga~in>!!"`
`For a while, we forgot about the wind getting stronger, and played around on the beach.`
`......This meeting with my cousins, who had grown so much over these last six years and were thoroughly enjoying their youth, felt truly refreshing.`
`......It was a little late now, but I realized that I should have buried the hatchet a lot sooner, and returned to the Ushiromiya family...`
`"It sure is nice to spend time together as cousins every once in a while..."`
`"Uu!`
` I like it with all the cousins together, it's funnn!"`
`"That's right.`
` We're already old enough.`
` It's not like we couldn't meet each other when our parents aren't around.`
` ...It might not be a bad idea for just us cousins to meet up and play every once in a while."`
`"That's a good plan.`
` Maybe we should set up something like that someday."`
`"I agree.`
` I'd like for us cousins at least to always be friendly with each other."`
`"Hey, hey, if you put the emphasis there, doesn't that make it sound like our normal families don't get along well?"`
`"Hahahahahaha."`
`George‐aniki and Jessica laughed, but it felt just a little strained.`
` ...Did I say too much?`
`Judging by how our parents had made quiet expressions and tired faces every once in a while during the boat ride and at the airport, maybe that was something I shouldn't have said.`
`"...That's right.`
` Just like Jessica said.`
` Let's always be friendly with each other."`
`"Uu!`
` Me too!`
` Everyone friendly!!"`
`"That's right.`
` Yeah.`
` We'll always be together.`
` We'll always be friendly."`
`"Heheh.`
` Man, we've been saying some pretty embarrassing stuff.`
` I feel kinda awkward."`
`"But I think that is very important.`
` It's very hard for people to always be friendly, let alone always be together, unless they wish for it."`
`"That's right.`
` You really can't take everyone being friendly for granted."`
`"Uu.`
` A witch I know said it.`
` Happiness won't be granted unless everyone believes in it."`
`"That's true.`
` Maybe some magic exists in the power of belief.`
` If we all believe in that, I'm sure it will bring us happiness."`
`"Alright.`
` Now the next embarrassing thing.`
` Let's all swear to believe together, alright?`
` That we'll all always be friendly, that we'll always be happy."`
`Screw becoming like our parents.`
`Searching for each other's weaknesses, going after Grandfather's fortune, screw all that forever...`
`"Alright!`
` We'll always be friendly and happy.`
` And let's all believe that."`
`No matter how long it had been, or how much fun we were having, it didn't stop the dark clouds from approaching Rokkenjima.`
`......I wonder if the typhoon will pass and show us the refreshing sky before we leave this island.`
`Who gives a crap about what our parents are plotting?`
`{n}Who gives a crap about the inheritance and the honor of our old family?`
`We're so young, and renewing our old friendship.`
`{n}And every one of us believes together that we can all be happy.`
`So...`
`I want this day to end,`
` without anything weird occurring,`
` in peace and happiness,`
` calmly...`
`No, ...not "I want it to end".`
`{n}......Please, let it end......!`
`"In your dreeeeeeeeeeeams!`
` Kyah‐hahah‐hah‐hah‐haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"Damn iiiiiiiit!!`
` Don't show up, don't appear!!`
` Damndamndaaamn!!"`
`"Sorry to keep you waiting.`
` The new game has finally been prepared."`
`"Come, let us begin this tale of tragedy!`
` Come to me, rain, winds, typhoon!`
` Cut this island off from the real world!!`
` Throw Rokkenjima into another world, into the netherworld, into a world of fantasy!"`
`And so, the tale repeated for the third time.`
`However, before the Endless Witch,`
` what point was there in counting one, two, three?`
`There was probably no point at all.`
`After all, this tale of fantasy would be repeated endlessly, until the match was settled, and either Battler or the witch surrendered.`
`And the sky grew dark and cloudy, the rain and wind were summoned together and became a typhoon...`
`And Maria could be seen in the rose garden, paying no mind to the rain that had started falling,`
` going around in circles, searching for that single rose which she had surely marked......`
`".........Not here...`
` Not here......`
` The rose we marked,`
` ......my rose isn't here...`
` ......Uu.`
` ............Uu!!"`
`Maria definitely remembered it.`
`That rose had been in the flower bed right here.`
` And yet, it wasn't.`
`She didn't know what to do with her irritation at not being able to find something which should have been there,`
` and, moaning bitterly, she couldn't help but keep going back and forth in circles around the same spot.`
`She was acting almost as though she would be able to see it if she looked at a different angle,`
` but try as she might, there was no way she would find something that wasn't there...`
`The wind grew increasingly stronger, and the rain turned into cold, large drops.`
`{n}There was no way Maria wasn't bothered by this.`
`However, if she couldn't find her rose here, it would surely disappear forever.`
`...Maria believed that.`
` That feeling spurred her on to keep searching for a rose that she had no chance of finding...`
`Just then, the cold drops of rain that were tormenting Maria were suddenly blocked.`
`"..................Uu?"`
`Maria raised her head.`
` ...When she did, she saw that an umbrella was opened there, protecting her from the rain...`
`And the one holding out that umbrella was...`
`......the witch she admired, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}...!!"`
`"What are you doing so frantically in the middle of all this rain?`
` You could catch a cold like this.`
` Even witches have to care for their own health."`
`"My...`
` ...My rose...`
` I can't find it...`
` ......Uu.`
` No matter how many times I search,`
` ......even though it was definitely here,`
` ...can't find it..."`
`Maria told {f:5:Beatrice} about how there had been a slightly unhealthy, pitiful rose,`
` and that she was sure they had marked it.`
`"Hohoh.`
` And you can't find it.`
` .........If you are a witch apprentice, you should use magic to search for the rose.`
` I believe that as long as you search with merely your eyes, it won't be nearly enough."`
`"......Uu.`
` ......Can't find it.`
` ...I did my best, and tried to search with magic, but can't find it..."`
`"While this is certainly ideal for practicing your magic, it might be a little too much for you with all of this wind and rain.`
` ......Allow me to lend you some special power.`
` Concern for one's disciples is also among the duties of a master."`
`"Tha‐...thank youuu.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}!!"`
`Maria's face, which had been full of sadness until just now, split open into a grin.`
`Maria knew.`
` She knew that there was nothing {f:5:Beatrice}'s magic couldn't do.`
`So she was sure that {f:5:Beatrice} would easily be able to find the rose that she couldn't find herself...`
`{f:5:Beatrice} closed her eyes lightly, acting as though she was listening for something in all this wind and rain.`
` Then she heard it, opened her eyes, and spoke.`
`"............Hmm.`
` All things in this world are transitory.`
` It is unfortunate, Maria.`
` ...It seems that your rose couldn't withstand all of this wind and rain."`
`"Uu......`
` Then, my rose is.........?"`
`"It was uprooted by the wind, and is no longer of this world."`
`"..................Uu......"`
`What {f:5:Beatrice} had said was certainly plausible.`
` ...There was nothing odd about the flower being broken off at the stem in this strong wind.`
`...However, Maria couldn't accept this, and bitterly gave a low‐pitched moan...`
`"...............No."`
`"Hoh?"`
`"......No no no!`
` It's my rose!!`
` My rose has to come back!`
` I'll bring it back to life with my magic."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}, teach me how to revive a rose with magic...!!"`
`"Ha!`
` It's much too early for an apprentice like you to learn the hidden art of Endless Magic.`
` Know your place."`
`"..................Uuuu."`
`Maria wiped the tears from her eyes, full of regret.`
`Seeing that expression, which so invited pity, {f:5:Beatrice} shrugged her shoulders and chuckled.`
`"Very well.`
` I will lend you power for the hidden art that can revive a rose."`
`"Really?!"`
`"Yes.`
` ......Well then, concentrate the power of your heart.`
` Close your eyes, forget the rain, forget the wind, search for the soul of the wandering rose with the eyes of your heart."`
`"......Uu."`
`Maria closed her eyes.`
`{n}Then, she repeated {f:5:Beatrice}'s poem‐like words...`
`"Come, try to remember.`
` Rose, what form did you have?"`
`"...Come, try to remember.`
` Rose, what form did you have...?"`
`"Don't look.`
` Don't listen.`
` And believe.`
` ......Release the power of your soul from the cage of flesh that imprisons it.`
` ............That's it.`
` ......Good..."`
`Around Maria, who was concentrating her power, her eyes tightly shut, small golden butterflies began to dance.`
` ......Was this the manifestation of the magical power Maria held?`
`"Lost soul of the rose.`
` Gather into one, and remember your form.`
` ......Come, gather, remember..."`
`The glitter of the gold butterflies began to strengthen, and their numbers increased; then, {f:5:Beatrice} raised a finger up to the skies, and they began to gather at the tip of that finger...`
`This was the miracle of the golden magic...`
`And the gold butterflies began to condense into a single dazzling grain of gold.`
` ......It was a single seed, glittering gold.`
`It sat on the tip of {f:5:Beatrice}'s finger, budded into a golden sprout, and opened into a golden leaf.`
` It then slowly fell from that fingertip, sank into the mud of the flower bed, and began to grow steadily...`
`...Maria, who admired magic and witches, must have really wanted to see this fantastical sight.`
`However, as an apprentice, Maria was still not qualified to see it.`
`...No, she was probably afraid that, if she opened her eyes to look, the power of her heart's concentration would be interrupted, and the magic would be lost.`
`Therefore, it was {f:5:Beatrice}, the one permitted to lay eyes on that golden miracle,`
` who was the one and only witch, and the master of many miracles...`
`Then, the fully grown rose bloomed, creating one golden flower.`
`And when {f:5:Beatrice} poked it with her finger in just the right way,`
` the gold‐colored sparkles scattered, just as if a golden soap bubble had popped, and what remained was a single beautiful rose.`
`"...Mmhm.`
` It looks like you've remembered a splendid rose."`
`"......However, if we just leave it mixed in with these other roses, you won't be able to tell it apart.`
` Shall I perform one last service?"`
`{f:5:Beatrice}, for the sake of her cute apprentice witch who was moaning even more now in concentration,`
` decided to cast one more little spell.`
`She snapped her fingers, and a single gold butterfly appeared, fluttered around, and landed on the flower that had just been revived.`
`Then it suddenly burst open and disappeared, becoming golden lace and marking the rose...`
`"That is sufficient.`
` ......Maria.`
` You may open your eyes now."`
`".........Uu?`
` Where's the rose?`
` Not here.`
` Not here."`
`"Not over there, over here.`
` ...Look.`
` I have marked it with golden lace."`
`"Wow... You did...!!`
` Awesome awesome awesome awesome!!`
` Thank you Beato, thank you Beato!!`
` I want to become a witch quickly, a Great Witch like Beato!!"`
`"And you can.`
` Long ago, I too wished for that innocently, just as you do, and I have attained that level."`
`Maria was ecstatic over the revived rose, clapping her hands and jumping around in joy.`
`...Watching that, {f:5:Beatrice} also smiled, looking fairly pleased.`
`Now, if I try, I can break or repair any soul, not just that of a rose, and kill and revive as I please.`
`So, the barrier created by the storm has closed Rokkenjima off from the real world.`
`Now is the time for the Golden Witch, the Endless Witch, {f:5:Beatrice} to descend.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} pulled from her pocket an envelope with the family crest, the One‐winged Eagle, and gave it to Maria.`
`Maria frolicked around at being selected to be the witch's messenger.`
`"So, Kinzo.`
` I've come to join in on your fun once again...`
` My preparations are already complete.`
` What about you?`
` I assume you have prepared enough coins to bet in tonight's game...?"`
`"Naturally, I am fully prepared, {f:5:Beatrice}...!!`
` I have prepared pieces in abundance.`
` I am ready both physically and mentally!"`
`"So, let me pay the ante.`
` All that you have given should be returned to you in the end.`
` Now, take it!!"`
`Kinzo flung the window of his study wide open, took off the reasonably large golden ring which had been on his finger,`
` and threw it into the darkness of the raging wind and rain...`
`That ring was struck by lightning, and after twinkling gold for an instant, disappeared.`
`Kinzo watched it go, grinning broadly and fearlessly.`
`"I don't see myself losing.`
` You are mine.`
` Forever!!"`
`The ring that Kinzo had thrown became a single gold butterfly, and fluttered around in the wind and rain.`
`It headed for the rose garden, almost as though it was being guided there.`
`It then found the figure of the Golden Witch, and fluttered down......`
`When it arrived right in front of {f:5:Beatrice},`
` it burst in a flash of gold, and returned to its original form of a ring, flipping up into the air.`
`It seemed as if it would simply fall back down into a puddle of water, but suddenly it stopped in midair.`
` ...Almost as if some transparent person had caught it.`
`Somehow, this seemed unexpected even to {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`However, she soon realized what—who—it was, and grinned broadly at it.`
`As she did, the figure of the person who had caught the ring began to fuzzily appear...`
`It was the figure of a young man wearing a butler's uniform embroidered with the One‐winged Eagle crest...`
`There was no man like this among the servants who served the Ushiromiya family.`
`{n}Even so, {f:5:Beatrice} laughed as though it was someone she remembered fondly.`
`"Ronove, is it.`
` ......It's been quite some time.`
` It seems that you have remembered me.`
` You always were a man who was serious about loyalty."`
`"It has been a very long time since you last corresponded...`
` There has not been a single day that I, Ronove, have forgotten that I serve you, Milady."`
`"Indeed, I was more fearful that you had forgotten about me, Milady.`
` I have, after all, known you to be quite forgetful."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...!`
` I see, yes, it seems I do forget easily.`
` I couldn't even remember your wry speech until I heard it again."`
`"For you, Milady."`
`With an exaggerated yet elegant gesture, he bowed respectfully,`
` and held out to {f:5:Beatrice} the Head's Ring that he had just caught.`
`"It is the Ushiromiya family Head's Ring, returned to you from Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
` It is now, once again, in the possession of its master."`
`"Indeed.`
` The proclamation by Kinzo that the game has started.`
` I acknowledge receipt."`
`"So, how would you like to play tonight?`
` Shall I prepare the roulette immediately?`
` Or shall I prepare some black tea first?"`
`"Both sound attractive, but for now, I suspect I need you to greet someone.`
` I am quite sure that man has his mouth hanging open and can't shut it.`
` Right, Battler?"`
`"Greetings.`
` Allow me to introduce myself.`
` I am called Ronove, and I serve at the side of Milady {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` It is truly a pleasure to meet you."`
`"See?`
` His mouth's hanging open and he can't shut it, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Isn't that obvious, another incomprehensible guy's just appeared!!`
` I grumbled that goat‐headed people would start doing the Bon dance, and then goat‐heads started showing up in swarms,`
` and since then, not only have those seven sexy‐assed babes appeared, but now even a butler has goddamn shown up!!`
` It doesn't make sense, cut it out!!"`
`"By the way, Battler.`
` Did you notice?`
` Have you realized that your meeting him...is a true "Devil's Proof"?"`
`"A, a Devil's Proof...?!`
` What do you mean...?"`
`"He may not look like it, but this guy is a genuine demon, with his name amongst the 72.`
` In other words, I've brought a demon right in front of you, which truly proves that they exist."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` Ronove holds a noble rank in Hell, the 27th highest‐ranked Great Demon.`
` He's a pretty useful man.`
` I summoned him at high cost and made him serve me."`
`"It is an honor to be introduced to you.`
` While my name is amongst those of the nobles of Hell,`
` I now serve as the head furniture of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, vulgar {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} and Great Witch from whom even demons would flee in fear."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*. He's a very useful man, but he is impudent with his words.`
` It's slightly frustrating that he sometimes forgets to respect his master."`
`"There is nothing in my contract regarding the way in which I must speak.`
` Would you like to change that contract?"`
`"It doesn't bore me, so it's fine.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`{f:5:Beatrice} turned her back to him, cackling.`
`After bowing once to her back, Ronove turned back to Battler and stuck out his right hand, showing off an innocent smile.`
` Normally, this would mean that he was asking for a handshake.`
`"......Wh‐...what is this supposed to be?"`
`"I am also one who has been subjected to Milady's whims.`
` In that sense, I am sure that we could become good friends.`
` This is a handshake of friendship."`
`"......Of course, it does not mean that you will be entered into a demon's contract, so rest assured."`
`"Sorry, but I'm right in the middle of a big fight with your master.`
` I only shake hands with an enemy after one of those situations like you find in teen dramas, when we've beaten each other up in a rainy schoolyard and are all worn out.`
` Remember that."`
`"I see.`
` Then, to shake hands with you, Battler‐sama, I must create a fitting atmosphere in a suitable location,`
` and we must exchange body language and sweet words that ring true to the heart.`
` I will find a suitable opportunity to prepare such a location."`
`"I too looove those kinds of situations, you know?`
` Pu ku ku ku...!"`
`Laughing tauntingly, Ronove whispered that to Battler, with his face so close that their noses were almost touching.`
`Battler, his face turning red after getting so close to another of the same sex, pushed him away.`
`"Y‐you're a creepy bastard...`
` I see, just right for Beato's butler..."`
`"It is an honor to receive such words of praise.`
` I am very confident in my tea brewing abilities, so please look forward to tea time.`
` Baking cookies is one of my hobbies, so I encourage you to have high expectations for the teacakes and such."`
`"Just what I would expect from a pair of the same gender.`
` You've started to get along well very quickly.`
` I'm jealous."`
`"My, my.`
` I apologize most humbly for making you jealous, Milady.`
` I will not stealthily snatch your guest away from you."`
`"Well then, I will leave for now to greet the rest of the furniture and inform them that I have retaken my post as head furniture.`
` Please forgive my short absence."`
`"Mmhm.`
` Only the common goats and the Seven Sisters used for the ritual have manifested themselves.`
` You will be able to finish up greeting them with ease."`
`"Oh?`
` Those lively Seven Sisters are here?`
` I wonder whether those naughty girls have grown a little more graceful?"`
`"......Ihihi.`
` If that's graceful, I'd have to doubt the definition of graceful."`
`"Is that so?`
` It seems that you have already enjoyed some playtime with the Seven Sisters."`
`"Judging by your expression, it seems that they are just as naughty as they were before.`
` Even though I am always telling them to act more fitting as a group of those who serve {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` What troublesome kids..."`
`"If that's your problem, don't worry.`
` They actually act perfectly fitting for their master..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` You have started to grow some guts!"`
`"However, to have a conversation is to acknowledge the person you are talking to.`
` Now that you have started to respond to my idle chatting, that is proof that you are gradually starting to accept my existence."`
`"Heh.`
` That's because, even if the sun starts rising from the west, I will definitely, definitely‐definitely, never accept that you're a witch.`
` Maybe if you start crying and kissing my shoes, I might be willing to have a more constructive discussion."`
`Even if Battler was bluffing, he still spoke forcefully, a fearless expression on his face.`
`The witch and her butler snickered together, realizing that their guest had regained more than enough of his willpower to take on a new game,`
` and that the preparations were complete...`
`After Ronove exchanged a few words with {f:5:Beatrice}, he bowed silently to Battler, scattered into gold butterflies, and disappeared.`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` It is truly pleasing when everything gets so lively."`
`"......How boring were those days when I was trapped alone on this island, unable to regain my power and without anyone to talk to."`
`"......I get how that creepy‐ass guy is really fitting as your butler."`
`"...But tell me.`
` Why has that butler only appeared now?`
` You said something about how only the goats and the seven stake chicks had manifested themselves.`
` What did that mean...?"`
`"Hmm, yes.`
` You still fight it, but I am a fully fledged witch.`
` I am in contact with a good many nonhuman entities in the netherworld."`
`"I'm sure.`
` None of your contacts are halfway near decent.`
` First some goat monsters, then those sexy‐assed babes, and this time a demon butler's showed up.`
` ......I don't want to say it, but there better not be more and more of these weird guys to come..."`
`"Hahahaha!`
` How much furniture do you think I have serving at my great golden mansion, how many demons do you think visit me there?`
` They will keep coming.`
` They will appear in any number."`
`"When the door to the Golden Land is opened, I will call back all of my furniture, and build my new castle here on Rokkenjima.`
` Then I plan to invite all of my old friends, and we will drink and dance together for three days and three nights."`
`"......I do also plan to invite Kinzo's family, of course?`
` You too, if you wish.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"......So let me get this straight.`
` Since you'd lost your power, for a long time, you couldn't summon them."`
`"...And your magic power has been recovering gradually, so you've become able to summon more and more monsters.`
` Is that what you're trying to say?"`
`"It is as you say.`
` You have managed to avoid taking that final step off the cliff,`
` but your heart is already wavering, and you are unable to deny that I am a witch.`
` That wavering in your heart has slightly restored my power as a witch."`
`"So are you saying that creepy butler appeared...`
`...because I started to surrender?"`
`"That's right.`
` Bit by bit, you are surrendering to me...!`
` You submitted to me so much in the last game that you received all of that humiliation, did you not?"`
`"Your back was truly pleasant for throwing my feet up on, I'll have you know.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"...D‐`
`......dammit.......`
` ...I thought that, as long as I didn't accept you, I'd be able to keep on going.`
` ...But it seems apparently I was mistaken."`
`"That's right.`
` The closer you get to submitting, the more the game will swing in my favor.`
` Isn't chess the same?"`
`"In the process of cornering each other's kings, we have traded several pieces.`
` It is true that I have yet to corner your king."`
`"......However, you have your hands full just enabling your king to escape, and have lost several important pieces to me, and conceded a large advantage.`
` It is only natural that further advances will lean in my favor."`
`"..................Damn........."`
`"As we continue, you will probably still succeed in frantically avoiding my checkmates, if nothing else.`
` ...However, as you do, I will steal your important pieces from you one by one.`
` In the end, you will have lost everything but your king, and you will receive a true checkmate, from which you will be denied any form of escape."`
`"......You were talking big last time, weren't you?`
` Something about how, since you would never accept me, this would be eternal torture that would torment me.`
` Only witches who have reached the endless level can talk about eternity.`
` You have never possessed that qualification.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*, hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!!"`
`"Kinzo‐sama has already publicly displayed the location of the hidden gold within the epitaph under my portrait.`
` The rules apply equally to all who can read the epitaph.`
` If you discover the gold, I shall return everything to you."`
`"Tonight, I ask that you enjoy your battle of wits with Kinzo‐sama to the fullest.`
` I sincerely pray that this night will be both intellectual and elegant.`
` {nobreak:—{f:5:Beatrice} the Golden}."`
`When Maria finished reading the letter that {f:5:Beatrice} had handed her, everyone was at a loss for words for a while.`
`And then, they all broke the silence at once...`
`"R‐Ridiculous.`
` What a worthless, vicious prank!"`
`"I agree wholeheartedly.`
` There is no way that Father would give up the Head's Ring.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` Ha!`
` What a transparent prank, hoping that bringing up that name will have us running around like headless chickens."`
`"Come on come on, who's the one behind this dessert packing a little too much punch?`
` I'll applaud and admire you if you come clean now.`
` Rosa?"`
`"O‐of course not...!`
` I wouldn't pull a prank assuming Father's name!"`
`"Then Aneki?!`
` Aniki?!"`
`"Me?!`
` Don't be absurd!`
` It was you, wasn't it?!`
` Only you could plan something this vulgar!!"`
`"Are you trying to mock me?!!`
` I'm the one who wants to question you!`
` Who is behind this ill‐natured prank?!"`
`Krauss beat the table and stared at everyone.`
`...Since that included the children too, he scared them greatly...`
`"...A letter from a mysterious person who claims to have been given full rights to Father's assets.`
` And if you think about how this family conference is all about discussing that,`
` ......I think it's too hasty to call this just a prank."`
`"I wouldn't be so sure.`
` It really might be one of Father's vulgar pranks...`
` He might've planned this to shock us a bit, since we've been discussin' the distribution of his inheritance without him..."`
`"If Dad was the one who planned this,`
` ......then we can't take what Maria‐chan just read aloud as a joke, right...?"`
`"......That's right.`
` If you interpret the contents literally, ...then this is a test from Father.`
` The epitaph of the witch has been displayed in the hall for quite some time now, so that any one of us could solve it.`
` There was plenty of notice.`
` So he's saying that the first person to solve it will be handed the headship along with all of his wealth, right...?"`
`......See? Our magic worked......`
`"Ridiculous, there is nothing of the sort!!`
` It is an unshakable fact that my husband will become the successor to the Ushiromiya family headship!!"`
`"This letter is the very thing that shakes it!`
` This letter is a message from the person who was given full rights to {i:all} of Father's wealth!"`
`"Nii‐san's right to become the head has returned to a blank slate.`
` The person who solves the riddle,`
` ......the person who finds {f:5:Beatrice}'s gold will become the next head of the Ushiromiya family!!"`
`"Ludicrous...!`
` Are you going to trust the meaningless words in that letter?`
` That the seal was the real thing?`
` How can we possibly trust that!!"`
`"Then let's try going to ask Father directly!`
` We aren't at the level where you can get away with saying that his mood's bad or that he's not feeling well, you know?!"`
`"The sealed wax clearly shows that this letter was from Father's representative!`
` If you doubt that, then show some proof, Nii‐san.`
` Prove that this letter is not an expression of Father's wishes!!"`
`"V‐very well.`
` It is just as you say.`
` It no longer matters whether Dad's in a good mood or not...`
` Let us go up and ask him directly."`
`"Let's do it.`
` We'll ask Dad directly.`
` Dad is to blame too here, why did he have to choose such a roundabout way?`
` Well, that is a little like him!"`
`"I, I wonder if it's alright to talk like that, taking it for granted that it is Father's letter..."`
`"Stupid Rosa!!`
` Isn't it obviously Father's letter?!`
` That letter was Father's!!`
` Isn't it obvious that he's giving the four of us an even chance to become the successor?!!"`
`"Idiot, die, you useless woman!!"`
`Rosa really is dumb.`
` Why doesn't she just give up and die forever...?`
`"I, I'm sorry...!`
` Th‐tha‐that's right...`
` I'm sorry..."`
`In the beginning, the adults had all doubted the authenticity of the letter,`
` but after just now realizing that this was a once‐in‐a‐lifetime chance for the three siblings other than Krauss in the struggle for the inheritance, Eva had changed her position, and had claimed that the letter was authentic.`
`Rudolf and Rosa also realized that, and agreed.`
`"Good gracious!!`
` How could adults like you take such a worthless prank this seriously...!`
` Even though I am not Father, I understand well his exasperation!!"`
`"Whoa whoa whoa whoa!`
` Natsuhi‐san, won't everythin' be fine if we just ask Father...?!`
` Everything'll be fine if Father simply mentions that he doesn't know about the letter!"`
`"Nii‐san.`
` Take responsibility, and just get him to say that he doesn't know about the letter.`
` This isn't a time to get scared just because he's in a bad mood, you know?!"`
`He's still scared of Father at his age, what an idiot.`
` Why doesn't he just give up and die forever...?`
`"R‐right!`
` Let's get this situation painted in black and white.`
` He's probably eating in his study right now.`
` I think it's time we had him rest his chopsticks for a moment...!"`
`"It's decided.`
` Let's go!`
` Kyrie, wait here for a while.`
` We'll go to check whether it's true or not and come back quickly."`
`"......Thank you.`
` I will wait patiently for Gohda‐san to bring the dessert."`
`The four siblings, Natsuhi, and Hideyoshi all stood from their seats forcefully and flew out into the hallway with a clatter.`
`Afterwards, the only ones left were the children, stunned completely speechless; Nanjo, who looked uncomfortable;`
` and Kyrie, shrugging her shoulders.`
`Maria, who had been at the center of all this turmoil, looked a little scared at the adults' sudden change.`
`...However, judging from her appearance,`
` she didn't look like she realized the full significance of what she had just read out.`
`"...What in the world......was that all about...?`
` I don't friggin' get it..."`
`"......Shitheads, every last one of them.`
` Do they really want the inheritance that much...?!"`
`"............Everyone,`
` this is our parents' problem.`
` It has nothing to do with us.`
` So you mustn't worry about it."`
`"Yeah, if only it was that easy...`
` ...They were so blatantly..."`
`"I thought they were better than this...!`
` Showing off their greed...!"`
`"Uu!`
` Everyone has to believe together we'll be happy!`
` Uu‐uu!"`
`"...That's right.`
` We all did promise.`
` Come on, Battler‐kun, Jessica‐chan, you too..."`
`"............Haah."`
`"......I feel like crap..."`
`We couldn't accept it at all, but we laid down our arms for the time being.`
`...We had known vaguely how filthy the family conference was going to be this time.`
` ...However, after that six‐year blank, I couldn't help being shocked...`
`Seeing that the children were completely dejected, Doctor Nanjo cleared his throat uncomfortably.`
`"...It's an adult discussion.`
` It has nothing to do with all of you young people.`
` Let us forget about it."`
`"I would if I could, okay...!"`
`"I know that it's hard on you.`
` But please, forget it for now, for their sakes."`
`"...All of your parents are fighting frantically to make your futures just a little brighter.`
` Please, don't look at your injured parents with those cold eyes when they come back."`
`".....................`
` Even on your request, Kyrie‐san,`
` ......that's a hard one."`
`"If we could be that cut and dried about it,`
` ......we wouldn't be kids in the first place....."`
`"Uu!`
` Everyone happyyy!!`
` Can't get daaaark!!`
` Belieeeeve!`
` Unless we all believe we can be happy, the happiness will get away!`
` We all have to believe!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"......That sounds good.`
` I'll believe too.`
` We can be happy."`
`"Uu!`
` Auntie Kyrie, thank you!!"`
`"Battler and Jessica onee‐chan, you believe too!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} is always saying that magic won't have any power if you don't believe.`
` Uu!"`
`Kyrie‐san rose from her seat quietly, went over to Maria, and crouched down so that their eyes met.`
`"......Uu.`
` You believed, Auntie Kyrie.`
` Now, Battler and Jessica onee‐chan have to believe."`
`"They're both strong people.`
` They'll feel better soon and do that for you."`
`"Yeah."`
`"More importantly,`
` ............I want you to tell me."`
`When Kyrie‐san said that, Jessica, George‐aniki, Doctor Nanjo and I all listened closely.`
`...It looked like our parents' minds had been filled by thoughts of Grandfather and the inheritance problem,`
` but we wanted to ask Maria about something simpler.`
`"Uu?`
` What?"`
`"Who gave you that letter, Maria‐chan...?"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}!!"`
`"The witch drawn in that portrait...?"`
`"Uu!`
` She gave me this letter and an umbrella!`
` And she used magic to fix my rose that was broken!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} is an awesome witch who can do anything!!"`
`"............Could you tell us about it in a bit more detail...?"`
`Without even being allowed to wait for dessert, we were chased out of the room.`
`I heard that, in the end, our parents were unable to get Grandfather to respond.`
`...Well, I'm not sure I should be saying this, but I feel like Grandfather deserves a pat on the back.`
`He had to be feeling pretty satisfied with the shock his strange letter had given to his children, who had all been so infatuated with distributing the inheritance while he was still alive.`
`I too felt like our despicable parents had gotten what they deserved in all of this confusion.`
`......But I couldn't really say that I was feeling great.`
`{n}I felt all sulky.`
`Grandfather hadn't entertained them for a moment, but he also apparently hadn't denied anything about the letter.`
`Grandfather's name pops up several times in the witch's letter.`
`If Grandfather knew that someone was stealing his name, then considering his character, he would probably be mad with rage.`
`But even though Grandfather now knew the contents of that letter, he had coolly ignored it.`
`In this case, did that count as a silent yes?`
`Auntie Eva and Dad had been trying to interpret the letter in their favor, their greed clearly visible.`
`It wouldn't have mattered so much if that was all, but the adults had then started focusing on Maria, who had received the letter.`
` They kept pounding her with questions about who had given her that letter.`
`Maria repeated over and over again that she had gotten it from {f:5:Beatrice}, but there was no way a mysterious person like that could be mixed in with the others on this island.`
`...After all, this is a small island where no one lives except the Ushiromiya family.`
`Maria kept repeating that she had gotten it from {f:5:Beatrice}, no matter how many times she was asked.`
`It seemed that the adults felt that she was trying to trick them, so they didn't hold back, and questioned her until she broke out in tears...`
`By the time Maria was released, she had cried herself to the point of exhaustion.`
`Our parents ordered us to go to the guesthouse and take Maria with us,`
` then shut themselves up in the dining hall, and started getting louder and louder as they discussed the inheritance.`
`It seemed that, because of that strange letter, the possibility had arisen that Uncle Krauss's ability to become the next head could be returned to a blank slate,`
` and in exchange for accepting him, my dad and the rest were trying to swindle Uncle Krauss out of a lot of money...or something like that.`
`Jessica and I, both astonished, were happy to move over to the guesthouse.`
`We didn't want to be under the same roof as those filthy adults, their heads so filled with thoughts about money.`
`George‐aniki pleaded on behalf of our parents, saying that he wanted us to understand them.`
`...I understood his reasoning.`
` No matter how filthy this talk of money was, it wouldn't go away if you just closed your eyes to it.`
`But even so, how could they so blatantly degenerate into such money‐grubbing demons...`
`Maria had cried herself dry, and was hiding in her bed.`
` She hadn't even twitched for a while, so she was probably sleeping...`
`".........Who in the world gave that letter to Maria‐chan?"`
`"George nii‐san.`
` You mustn't ask that anymore.`
` If Maria says she got it from {f:5:Beatrice}, can't we just leave it at that...?"`
`"I mean, we don't want to make her cry any more than this."`
`......That said.`
` Even we felt a confusion that we couldn't clear away.`
`"There are only 18 people on this island now.`
` The thought that, in the middle of all this rain, an unknown 19th person gave Maria‐chan that letter, and is now hiding somewhere,`
` honestly doesn't seem realistic at all."`
`"Probably...Shannon or someone put on the dress from that portrait, and skillfully planned this ahead of time with Maria."`
`"...Although of course, as soon as Maria saw that dress, that might have been enough on its own to convince her that it was {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"Maybe it doesn't really matter who handed her the letter.`
` The important thing is who sent it."`
`"...The point is that Grandfather wanted to cause an uproar by assuming the name of the witch.`
` Seriously, that old geezer's good at riling people up."`
`The truth was probably that our occult‐loving Grandfather was playing around,`
` by choosing a dramatic way of handing the letter over to Maria, who shared the same hobby as he did.`
`......Paying no heed, though, to the trouble it would cause Maria, or the rest of us.`
`"Seriously. Messing around with Maria's pure heart...`
` It doesn't matter who handed the letter over.`
` Maria says that she got it from {f:5:Beatrice}, so let's treat it that way."`
`"I agree.`
` Let's do that.`
` To Maria‐chan, {f:5:Beatrice} is kinda like what Santa Claus is to most kids."`
`"Whether it be a non‐existent 19th person or Santa Claus,`
` as long as we accept that they exist, they will at least "exist" inside Maria.`
` ...I see, it's important to lie to a child to protect their dreams."`
`"............Hmm?`
` What's up, Jessica?`
` Are you still angry?"`
`Jessica had her hand on her chin, as though there was something that she just couldn't understand.`
`When I called out to her, she came to her senses.`
`"Aah, ......sorry.`
` Well, ......actually,`
` ......I was wondering if it was possible that Maria actually met {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"...What do you mean by that?`
` Are you saying that there's a 19th person on this island?"`
`"If we take what Maria‐chan said to heart, then we do arrive at that answer."`
`"No, that's not what I mean.`
` ......I'm talking about the story that someone we don't know has been living on this island since long ago."`
`"Living, you say. Where?"`
`"...In the forest."`
`The adults were gathered in the dining hall, spending a very long time continuing the discussion that had been started by {f:5:Beatrice}'s letter...`
`Krauss strongly claimed that the letter was a simple prank,`
` but he couldn't overturn the claim that Kinzo's failure to deny the letter was answer enough.`
`Judging by Kinzo's character, if he knew that a letter had been written by someone else in his name, he would be mad with rage.`
`Since all of the siblings knew that, Krauss had no choice but to withdraw his claim.`
`Without even having to summarize it, the contents of the letter were simple.`
`The person who solved the witch's epitaph would receive the headship and assets.`
`This did a lot of damage to Krauss, who was thought to have been guaranteed the succession,`
` and for everyone else, who had given up on that long ago, it was better news than they could ever have hoped for.`
`However, there were some points that worried them.`
`"The person who solved the epitaph" was not limited to a member of the Ushiromiya family.`
`Taken literally, anyone, no matter how doubtful their origin, could succeed to the Ushiromiya family.`
`And furthermore, this meant there was a chance that all of the Ushiromiya family's assets could be stolen by some unknown person.`
`In that sense, it was definitely not a situation where anyone could lower their guard, even the siblings other than Krauss.`
`Had this letter come from a saboteur sent by Kinzo who called themselves {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` ...Or was this the scheme of some unknown person trying to steal the Ushiromiya family's wealth?`
` They still didn't know the truth.`
`...But they could say one thing for certain.`
`Maria had received this problematic letter...`
`today,`
` on this island.`
`In other words, someone who was planning something related to that letter was on this island today.`
`......Was the person who set it up Kinzo, one of the four siblings,`
` or maybe some unknown person?`
`No matter how much they suspected each other, they couldn't reach a conclusion.`
`After getting tired of bickering with each other,`
` they finally reached the extremely obvious conclusion that doubting each other was just a waste of time...`
`"......We've made no progress.`
` We've just been wasting time."`
`"That's right.`
` Now that you realized it, we won't have to waste so much."`
`"It is not certain that Father is the one who sent the letter.`
` My husband has merely had enough of you being unable to hold a conversation."`
`"Which one of us can't hold a conversation?`
` You keep yelling at me every time I say something.`
` Do you truly think that such shameful behavior is fitting for a member of the Ushiromiya family?"`
`"Give it a rest, Eva.`
` You too, Natsuhi‐san.`
` That topic's finished for now."`
`"Sh‐shall we all cool our heads off for now?`
` Let's have some cool drinks brought over."`
`"That sounds good.`
` It would probably be wiser if we cooled our heads.`
` Baby, don't you want to go for a smoke, too?"`
`"...Aneki looks like she's in a bad mood.`
` So I'll pass on that smoke.`
` But I agree about the cool drinks.`
` Rosa, have someone bring some water.`
` A whole pitcher."`
`"Alright..."`
`Rosa headed over to the extension telephone in the corner of the room and called the servant room.`
` She then passed on what Rudolf had told her to the person on the other end.`
`The vicious bickering up until now vanished like it had never happened.`
`{n}That silence continued until Gohda finished setting the table and retreated from the room...`
`".........Is there anything else that you require?"`
`"No.`
` Please leave us."`
`"Yes.`
` ...Then if you will excuse me.`
` If you need anything, call me at any time."`
`After listening to the sound of Gohda's footsteps disappear off into the distance, everyone took a deep breath at the same time to break the tension.`
`"...It sure is raining hard.`
` I wonder if our witch, this 19th person, is taking shelter in the arbor in the rose garden about now?"`
`"...I wonder.`
` ......They might be able to avoid the rain, but it would be quite cold."`
`".........A mysterious 19th visitor.`
` Sounds pretty interestin', just like a mystery novel.`
` Normally, in that kind of story, it's a safe bet that the person doesn't exist, that one of us 18 would be fakin' it."`
`"...I suspect Genji and the others.`
` We should have found any excuse we could to dismiss all of the servants of the One‐winged Eagle."`
`"Come now, don't say that.`
` We must be grateful for their long years of service.`
` ...Of course, we can't let our guard down."`
`"So, then, you also agree that whether or not Father was behind this,`
` the person who handed Maria‐chan the letter was a servant?"`
`"Indeed.`
` After all, we were all being "friendly" in our big happy circle the whole time until dinner, weren't we?`
` All of us siblings have alibis.`
` Only a servant could have handed Maria that letter."`
`"...But all of the servants...`
`said that they were too busy with the bed‐making to have any spare time during which they could have gone to Maria in the rose garden...`
` ....................."`
`"Hey hey, what are you trying to say then?`
` You aren't saying that the witch of the forest {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama came over and actually handed Maria‐chan that letter, are you?"`
`"Ahahaha.`
` Rosa, you used to believe so much that it really frightened you, right?`
` You don't mean to say that you still believe at this age?`
` The witch of the forest."`
`......If she did exist, I'd love for her to appear.`
`{n}But no matter how much I wished, she didn't appear before me even once.`
` She didn't save me from my crisis...`
`"O‐of course not...`
` I just thought that since all 18 of us said that we didn't do it, there might really be a 19th person..."`
`"That can't be. In the first place, we were the only ones who came on that boat.`
` We didn't see any mysterious stranger ridin' with us.`
` You don't think that they might have swam across this rough sea, right?`
` I can't really imagine that.`
` Wahahahahahaha."`
`"......Logically that's true.`
` It is difficult to imagine that there's a single hidden and uninvited guest on this isolated island...`
` ...However,`
` .........it looks like some of us still can't bring themselves to discard that possibility entirely, doesn't it?"`
`Hideyoshi had laughed it off, saying that there couldn't be a 19th person,`
` but Kyrie had sensitively picked up on the delicate atmosphere among the four siblings.`
`Just by common sense, there couldn't possibly be any uninvited guests on this small, isolated island.`
`How on earth would they get here, and from where, and where would they be hiding themselves?`
`{n}And why wouldn't they appear openly, even though they had sent a letter in their own name?`
` ...None of these could be explained.`
`But considering that none of the four siblings had joined in on Hideyoshi's laughing,`
` they seemed unable to completely deny in their hearts the possibility of a 19th person...`
`"Kyrie‐san.`
` I would like to make this clear: we don't remotely believe in that fairytale about the legend of the witch."`
`"......Another topic to insult Father, is it?`
` Simply mentioning that is a betrayal against him."`
`"*giggle*giggle*.`
` Well, yes.`
` ......However, this is Father we're talking about.`
` It is possible that he......you know...?"`
`"...............I, ...I don't know anything......"`
`"What's this, what's this?`
` Why's everyone gotten so gloomy...?`
` What are you talkin' about?"`
`"...You're sayin'...the legend of the witch isn't a joke, ...but a fact?`
` That's ridiculous!"`
`"Hahahaha.`
` Of course, nobody believes in some witch riding a broom and flying in the sky.`
` ......But, the woman in that portrait,`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice}, may really have existed on this island."`
`".........Hideyoshi‐san,`
` it looks like we aren't talking about a witch, but something a little simpler.`
` ...Let me see if I have this correct."`
`"You all suspect that Father had a mistress named {f:5:Beatrice} living in secret somewhere on this island.`
` ......Is it something like that?"`
`"Father is a paragon of a man, a model of self‐discipline and restraint!`
` It is completely inconceivable that he would bring something so filthy onto this island...!"`
`Natsuhi snapped at her immediately, but it looked like the four siblings, including her husband Krauss, didn't think that way.`
`...On the contrary, it appeared that they thought Kinzo was exactly the kind of person likely to attempt such a stunt.`
`The existence of a mistress who had Kinzo under her spell...`
`had been whispered of since the very beginning, when he had built the mansion on this island......`
`"......I'm sorry, Natsuhi‐san, I know how much you respect Dad, but that rumor's been around for a long time.`
` Dad prepared this island by himself, and built everything."`
`"...It's been suspected from the beginning that this mansion might have some hidden tricks or secret rooms known only to Dad,`
` and it's also always been whispered that hidden somewhere on this island, there might be a secret mansion none of us know about."`
`"Yes, it has.`
` This island might look small on a map, ...but it's quite large for just the Ushiromiya family to live on."`
`"......So people have wondered whether he might have built a secret mansion somewhere in the uncivilized forest for his mistress to live in?`
` That's a rather large‐scale story."`
`"In the beginning, we used to say that it might be somewhere inside this mansion.`
` ......That there might be a hidden basement, with a fabulous hidden room, where the witch in that portrait was secretly hiding."`
`"...After seeing that intricate auto‐lock on Dad's study, it isn't too hard to imagine, right?"`
`"......Indeed, Father did spread the rumor that he hid a large amount of gold in some secret place, protected by some secret mechanism.`
` It would not surprise me to find there existed some hidden room inside this very mansion that none of us knows about yet."`
`"When Mother was alive, she would often scour the entire mansion searching for it when Father was absent.`
` ......Mother also suspected what Rudolf just said.`
` She believed that there was a hidden door or stairway somewhere, and that his blonde‐haired mistress was hidden behind it."`
`It's hard to believe, but there are some actual examples in other countries of people cheating with someone over a period of several decades by making them live in a hidden attic room.`
`And this was Kinzo, with a mansion this extravagant.`
`{n}......There was endless opportunity to suspect the existence of hidden rooms...`
`"The legend of the Rokkenjima witch,`
` ...from what I'd heard, it was just a fairy tale made up to prevent children from entering the uncivilized forest by scaring them.`
` ...But it's starting to sound like there's a little more to the story."`
`"Well, yeah.`
` As you know, this is a lonely island without anything but the Ushiromiya mansion on it."`
`"When Rosa and I were little brats, on stormy nights, we were so scared by the sound of rustling trees we could hear from the forest.`
` We had this crazy delusion that something weird might be looking out at us from between those trees.`
` It's only natural for any brat to think something like that."`
`"...But some people heard Rosa and me making those claims, and weren't happy to dismiss it as a kid's delusion.`
` ...Isn't that right, Aneki?"`
`".........Yes.`
` Nii‐san and I thought that by coincidence you might have spotted Father's mistress, who had been living in secrecy on this island, as she went out for a walk when no one was looking.`
` Of course, Mother did too."`
`"...Among the older servants too, you often heard that ghost story about how the witch of the portrait wanders around the mansion at midnight.`
` Outwardly, I laughed that off as just a ghost story, but on the inside, I suspected very much that it referred to the existence of a hidden mistress."`
`"In that case, .........you're sayin' that the existence of a 19th person...`
`might not be completely ridiculous?`
` ...That they might actually be somewhere around here......?"`
`".........Sounds like a case of that "Devil's Proof" Rudolf‐san is always talking about."`
`"...It might be possible to prove that there is a 19th person, but it's impossible to prove that a 19th person doesn't exist.`
` ......Should we continue this discussion assuming that there is a person named {f:5:Beatrice} hiding somewhere on this island......?"`
`"As the first step in crisis management, that's the right way.`
` ...It's probably way more prudent to say she might exist, rather than thinking there's no way she does."`
`"I, ...I see.`
` Sorry, I was a bit careless...`
` Rosa‐san, sorry for laughin' just now..."`
`"Huh, ...ah, ......it's alright, I don't mind."`
`Hideyoshi apologized deeply for not being conscious enough of danger, despite calling himself the president of a company.`
`Silence fell again.`
`By preparing for the existence of a 19th person,`
` they were accepting that some unknown person was hidden on this island.`
`And since this person might have something bad planned for them,`
` it was only natural that it came with a certain degree of discomfort...`
`"......In the past, Father would sometimes suddenly disappear without telling anyone where he went.`
` After all, he is a person who appreciates silence.`
` It was not out of the ordinary for him to shut himself up in some archive after purposefully not telling anyone where he was going."`
`"......However, after the witch theory began to be refined into the theory about his mistress, it was eventually whispered that he was secretly going back and forth to see her."`
`"Mom was completely overridden with doubt in her final years.`
` Sometimes, she'd suddenly start making a racket and asking the servants to look for Dad immediately, saying it was an emergency."`
`"......Yes, that did happen sometimes.`
` Mother was always doing things like that in her later years, and that frightening atmosphere still hasn't gone away.`
` ...I can say it for certain now.`
` She was a person to be pitied."`
`"So then, ...what were the results of those large‐scale searches of the house?`
` Did they find anythin'?"`
`"No.`
` Not on a single occasion did they even find Father, let alone any hidden rooms.`
` And every time, after a lot of time had passed, he would suddenly show up somewhere.`
` Then he'd say that he'd been taking a nap in some archive or that the wind had called him down for a walk on the beach."`
`"...But it was always some place where the servants had already looked.`
` ......We never knew where Father had gone."`
`"By that time, Father was already famous for his adoration of the occult,`
` so some of the servants exaggerated, saying that he might have turned into butterflies and danced around the rose garden."`
`"So in short, Father frequently disappeared, and no one knew where he went."`
`"Yeah.`
` Since we couldn't find him no matter how much we looked inside the mansion, we grew increasingly of the opinion that Dad might have gone somewhere outside it.`
` But there isn't much to speak of in the area outside the mansion.`
` ......Which leaves only the expansive forest."`
`"And if you tie that in with the legend of the witch from the forest, you get a theory like this:`
` Dad had actually built a hidden mansion somewhere in the forest,`
` inside of which a mistress by the name of {f:5:Beatrice} lived, and he sometimes went to see her."`
`"...I was also young at the time.`
` At one point, I became intent on catching Father cheating, and I tried to follow him when he went outside."`
`"...I failed, of course.`
` Every time Dad went outside, he was oddly intent on staying out of sight, and was extremely cautious that he wasn't being watched.`
` He was like that to a very odd extent."`
`"But that actually made me sure.`
` He must have been going out for some reason that the members of his family couldn't know about."`
`"And that would be going to meet his mistress.`
` Probably tryin' to avoid being seen."`
`After seeing Hideyoshi nod and say "yes, yes" as though this was quite obvious, Eva got a little sullen.`
`"...Well, anyway.`
` This island was like a sketchbook in which Father, with his Western obsession, could draw out all of his dreams.`
` ......Everything about this island was exactly how Father wanted it.`
` It wouldn't be odd at all if there were some hidden mansion for his mistress to live in..."`
`Eva's words spoke for what all of the siblings had come to think.`
`For a while, the room returned to silence again, and everyone listened to the sound of the wind and rain...`
`......Was there a hidden mansion on this island, and had Kinzo's mistress been living there in hiding for a long, long time......?`
`Every one of them had thought that they were being too suspicious, and had refrained from saying it for the longest time, but...`
`......it had been a common opinion that everyone shared.`
`Kyrie, who had been listening the whole time with her eyes closed, spoke to no one in particular.`
`"...How long has this rumor about Father's mistress been around?"`
`"As soon as we moved to this island, so about thirty years ago."`
`"Think about it, it would've been impossible for him to have a hidden mansion constructed once we came here.`
` People and materials would have to be going in and out.`
` We'd have found out in no time."`
`"So, if this was possible, it would have had to have happened before we moved here.`
` ...It probably could have been built along with this mansion when we were still living in Odawara."`
`"It's probably appropriate to assume that he had the plan laid out from the beginning to set up a double life with his family and his mistress.`
` And his relationship with that mistress probably went back to the days when we lived in Odawara."`
`"Probably.`
` If, as Father says, she is the source of the vast amount of gold that he used to gain the funds which resurrected the Ushiromiya family,`
` we could probably conclude that they had a close relationship since Odawara at least."`
`"......A relationship trusting enough for her to lend him a vast quantity of gold.`
` I can't even imagine how old that relationship must have been."`
`".........Most likely, she gave Father some invaluable advice for achieving success in business.`
` It's natural to think that, out of a sense of gratitude for that, he described it as if this person had given him gold."`
`"If you think about it that way, it's obvious that they would have a close relationship after that.`
` Rather than a debauched relationship with a mistress, it was probably a relationship of gratitude to the person who saved the Ushiromiya family from crisis."`
`"......That way of looking at it might have some sense to it too.`
` But, even in that case, isn't building a hidden mansion and havin' her live in it going a little too far?`
` Doesn't that mean that there were some emotions in play beyond gratitude?"`
`"Well, this is all speculation.`
` ......In the first place, no one has ever found that hidden mansion."`
`"...Aniki, you're planning on expanding this island into a resort, right?`
` You might stumble onto it by chance in the process, who knows?`
` Maybe you'd even unexpectedly find some gold there, too."`
`"...Hahahaha.`
` Do you think Rokkenjima is Treasure Island or something?"`
`"Don't play dumb.`
` ...Although you say that you're opening a resort, we know that it's just a cover for a full‐scale investigation of the entire island, okay?`
` Although, it sounds as if, due to all that trouble and confusion we were talking about earlier, you haven't been able to carry it out, of course?"`
`"I don't know what you're talking about, but you misunderstand.`
` It is perfectly natural that investigating this island would be the first step in turning it into a resort."`
`Krauss tried to play dumb, but it was plainly obvious to his siblings, who knew him so well.`
`...Krauss was definitely sure of the existence of a hidden mansion.`
`And under the pretense of opening a resort, he had been investigating the island in detail, searching for a clue as to the location of the hidden gold.`
`They couldn't tell whether that conviction was just him over‐thinking things, or whether it was based on some physical proof.`
`......However, if Krauss, with all his guile, was convinced,`
` then the other siblings were similarly convinced that there must be a sufficient basis for it...`
`"......The story about a witch livin' in a forest is straight out of a fairy tale,`
` but a story about some blonde‐haired girl livin' secretly in a mansion no one knows about in the middle of a forest...isn't much better."`
`"Certainly.`
` Taken on its own, the setting sounds just like some kind of children's story.`
` You like those, don't you, Rosa?"`
`"......Huh, ......w‐...well, yes..."`
`"When the mansion was built on this island, Father was at the height of his prosperity.`
` With his money, he could probably have obtained anything, made any of his delusions real.`
` ...A mansion in the forest where a witch quietly waits...`
` ......It sounds like the kind of setting Dad would like."`
`"......Doesn't it?`
` Like something from the occult or a fairy tale.`
` ...It feels like Dad would be into that."`
`On this island, which the Ushiromiya family had lived on for thirty years now,`
` a hidden mansion that no one knew about had been quietly built, and within, there lived a witch known only by her portrait...`
`Even this hard‐to‐believe story...`
`might not be completely delusional considering all of Kinzo's strange habits and his vast wealth...`
`"......It might not have been impossible for Father to build a hidden mansion to satisfy such a dream."`
`"......However, let's be realistic.`
` Would it be possible to house his beloved woman in that hidden mansion for decades without it becoming inconvenient...?"`
`"......Well,`
` if there was love, it could have been possible, right?"`
`"Think about the facilities needed to let his beloved woman live healthily.`
` ......And how Father would do it.`
` For example, even if it was on a small scale, it would have to be an intricate and pleasant residence."`
`"And, in terms of upkeep, it would need:`
` electricity,`
` gas,`
` running water.`
` As well as possibly some people to help her.`
` Even providing for her meals would be quite difficult."`
`"She would need clothes and makeup, daily necessities.`
` ...The needs of a woman aren't simple.`
` ......Would it be possible to maintain all of that without any of the family or the servants noticing?"`
`"............When you say it that way, it sure sounds like a weak point in our theory.`
` ...But that isn't enough to get rid of my feeling that Dad might have been able to pull it off anyway.`
` ...After all, it is Dad."`
`"That's right.`
` ...It is Father."`
`"When Father had something he wanted to succeed in, he would succeed no matter what.`
` ...Saying that it would be difficult for a normal person and is therefore impossible...doesn't apply when it comes to Father."`
`"Yes.`
` You should never underestimate Father.`
` ......Dad's madness can't be understood by normal people."`
`I wouldn't put it past {i:the} Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
`...As long as that word could accompany his name, a considerable amount of credibility dwelled in any story, no matter how absurd.`
`However, that didn't shake the importance of what Kyrie had said.`
`This was different from stealthily raising a kitten in a cardboard box and keeping it a secret from your parents.`
`Taking care of a person in secret over a period of thirty years would be an incalculably massive task...`
`"......The legend of Father's gold started before he gained possession of Rokkenjima.`
` That would mean he and his mistress go back over thirty years..."`
`"How old would that make her?`
` In the worst case, she could be as old as us or older, right?"`
`"...By that age, the body starts to break down.`
` I don't care what the mansion's like, I couldn't call livin' in a place where people's eyes can't reach, almost as though she were under house arrest, agreeable..."`
`"That's right.`
` ...If what Father told us about {f:5:Beatrice} is true, then that relationship has lasted for over thirty years."`
`"......She might have been a charming young woman at the time, but it is probably appropriate to think that she's now an old bag like us.`
` I can easily imagine that, given the contents of that letter."`
`"You should talk.`
` *cackle*cackle*."`
`Krauss laughed, as though blind to his own shortcomings.`
`Of course, Eva was offended, but she didn't strike back.`
`"Quit it, Aniki.`
` ......So if everything we imagine is true, she should want to throw out her chest with pride and join in on Dad's inheritance problem."`
`"I mean, ...there's a good chance that this love was mutual, unlike with Mom.`
` She might have been aware she was his mistress, and yet at the same time, felt a kind of pride as his real wife."`
`".........That is an insult to Mother."`
`"Yeah, sorry.`
` ...But everyone knows it was a political marriage decided by his elder relatives.`
` ...Because of that, we can be sure that it wouldn't be odd for Dad to have a mistress."`
`The family sank after the Great Kanto Earthquake, and Kinzo was set up as the Ushiromiya family head against his will.`
`However, in the beginning, he was influenced strongly by the elder relatives, who treated him like a puppet while they pulled the strings.`
`He wasn't permitted to decide anything by himself, not even his marriage partner...`
`......And by his meeting with the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} in those unhappy days,`
` Kinzo's Legend of the Gold was quickly embellished into something dramatic.`
`In other words,`
` ...it could mean...`
` that Kinzo met with a woman he really did love.`
`If she also knew his whole story,`
` then even if they weren't marriage partners, it wouldn't have been odd for her to consider herself his true wife, inside her heart.`
`...And now, the person registered as his true wife was already dead...`
`"...In which case, she might be fully intending to encroach on not just the rights to his assets, but the battle over the headship as well."`
`".........I see.`
` I'm starting to see the purpose of this letter.`
` The headship to the one who solves the epitaph's riddle...`
` So that's what it means."`
`"Even if that mistress obtained a rank within the Ushiromiya family, since she is not a direct relative of Father, she would be inferior to even the children.`
` ...In other words, she would be right below Rosa in rank.`
` That's not a good position to join the battle for the headship."`
`"So that's it.`
` ...If someone can solve the witch's riddle, they will receive the headship regardless of rank.`
` In other words, it is the most advantageous condition that {f:5:Beatrice} could get, since she had no chance whatsoever."`
`The revival of the Ushiromiya family had been made possible by the gold {f:5:Beatrice} had bestowed.`
` ...In other words, the credit belonged to her.`
`She had built that wealth together with Kinzo, so it was natural that she would have thought of herself as the one who should inherit it...`
` It would also be natural for her to despise the thought of giving a single cent to the children of the wife Kinzo had never loved.`
`"H‐how incredibly impertinent...!`
` Even if this mistress actually existed, for her to fight over the rights to the head's inheritance would be an outrageous action far above her place!`
` What disregard for her own place...!"`
`Natsuhi turned red, her fist quivering.`
`...There were also complicated circumstances behind her entry into the Ushiromiya register.`
`{n}Those who knew that understood more or less why she was so angry for the sake of Kinzo's dead wife.`
`"...Well, thanks to her outrageous action, we now all have an even chance, right?"`
`"And also, Father has given that outrageous action his silent approval.`
` ......Will the person who succeeds the Ushiromiya family be his mistress {f:5:Beatrice}, or one of us, who he may not love, but who do carry his blood?`
` Maybe he wants to make us struggle over that to see who is worthy."`
`As Eva giggled roguishly, Krauss shrugged his shoulders and looked away.`
`"......However, since it was the other party that brought up this condition,`
` I wonder if that means that the other party has a significant advantage."`
`"Tha‐that's a point, too.`
` ...In the first place, if {f:5:Beatrice} meant that letter literally, then she's Father's alchemist.`
` In other words, she's the manager of his gold.`
` It wouldn't be strange at all if she knew where it was hidden, would it?!"`
`"What a bad joke this is.`
` It's like she's givin' us a riddle that she knows the answer to!`
` She'll probably show up rudely, say "hey, here's the answer, I'll take the headship now",`
` and snatch everythin' away from us!"`
`"........................`
` ...That's right.`
` The one who sets a riddle always knows the answer.`
` There's a good chance that this is all a trap to steal everything from us."`
`"...If you think about it like that, don't you start to doubt whether she really has the gold in the first place?`
` Why would she tell us about it?`
` All she'd have to do would be stay silent and embezzle it."`
`"You're right.`
` ...Doesn't make much sense."`
`Indeed, it was just as they said.`
`If the epitaph showed the way to where the gold was hidden, why would she challenge them to try to solve it?`
` If they actually did solve it, wouldn't the gold all be stolen...?`
`Could it be that this person was trying to stir the siblings up so that they tried to solve the epitaph,`
` and would then snatch it up before they did solve it...?`
` That was a very reasonable guess.`
`"............No,`
` if you flip over the chessboard, there might be a pretty good chance that they actually do have the gold."`
`"How can you be so certain?"`
`"...Wait, Aneki.`
` ......Kyrie, please keep talking.`
` Why do you think that?"`
`"After all, do they really think that just telling us the answer to the riddle in the witch's epitaph,`
` would seriously be enough for us to hand over the headship of the Ushiromiya family?`
` That we'd be so impressed at the answer to the riddle that we'd just give up?"`
`"......Well,`
` ......that's true.`
` If they think we'd just give up after bein' told the answer to the riddle,`
` that we'd just say "here you go" and hand it over, they've got another thing comin'."`
`"Of course.`
` The headship of the Ushiromiya family is not something that can be handed over so easily!"`
`"That's it exactly.`
` No matter how one‐sided a game {f:5:Beatrice} proposes, and even if she splendidly shows us the answer,`
` there's no way that we'll obediently hand over the headship."`
`"......In other words, unless there is something that forcibly compels us to play this game under fair conditions,`
` this game won't function as a game."`
`"That's right.`
` ......Unless the losers are {i:forcibly compelled} to hand over the headship, the game doesn't work."`
`"And what would this compelling force be?`
` Would they bind us in chains and threaten us into handing over the headship?"`
`".........I see.`
` I get it.`
` ......They would just have to do something which would make us willingly give up the headship.`
` I see.`
` ...Then, yes, certainly, {f:5:Beatrice} would have to be in possession of the ten tons of gold...!"`
`"R‐right, I get it too!`
` In other words, ...it's a trade, right?!"`
`"Huh?`
` Wh‐what do you mean...?`
` A trade?`
` Trade what?!"`
`"The Ushiromiya family headship for the hidden gold.`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice} surely plans to tell us the location of the ten tons of gold, and use that as a bribe to gain the Ushiromiya family headship."`
`"R‐ridiculous!!"`
`"They want to trade the succession to the glorious Ushiromiya family for...m‐money?!`
` Blasphemy!!`
` Blasphemy against the Ushiromiya family!!"`
`"......Listen without getting mad.`
` ...About how much wealth does this glorious Ushiromiya family have right now?`
` Are we really that affluent?"`
`"Th‐the definition of affluence is not dependent on property.`
` It is about heart!`
` Of what relevance is our financial situation to—"`
`Krauss interrupted Natsuhi as she started to go on emotionally.`
`In this situation, the more she went on and on emotionally, the worse it would actually sound for them.`
`".........Myself aside, I have heard that the rest of you are in pretty unfavorable situations right now."`
`"Ohhh, really?`
` I've heard that your financial situation is extremely unfavorable, actually?"`
`"Repeatedly exchanging collateral for new money to gamble with.`
` Repeatedly dabbling in gamble after gamble, unable to accept your losses.`
` ...If you want to talk about our state of affairs, not one of us here is as impoverished as you, Nii‐san."`
`"How much have you lost, Nii‐san?`
` You have no talent!"`
`"W‐who are you saying has no talent?!!`
` And impoverished, you say?!!"`
`Natsuhi became indignant once again, but Krauss raised his hand again and interrupted her.`
`"......It seems you are making a small mistake.`
` Business is not something that can be judged based simply on progress.`
` When someone conducts business with a view to the long‐term as I do,`
` it may sometimes appear at a glance that they have suffered some significant short‐term losses."`
`"Aniki,`
` we've been collecting evidence.`
` Now is not the time to be putting up a front."`
`"......So this is what Kyrie is trying to say.`
` ......Every last one of us is stuck for money.`
` And {f:5:Beatrice} has ten tons of gold."`
`"......As the only person who knows the location of the ten tons of gold, {f:5:Beatrice} is planning on using it to force us to sell the position of family head.`
` ...About how much is ten tons of gold worth?"`
`"As a rough estimate... 2 billion yen?`
` .........No, 20 billion yen.`
` If she threw that much our way, we would be jumping with joy to accept her as the successor to the head."`
`The scene returned to silence.`
`Even the rain and the wind sounded louder.`
` ...That was probably also the sound of the windstorm that disturbed the insides of their minds...`
`"............Y‐...you must be joking.`
` ...The thought that just because she tossed me a little money...`
`......I'd give up the family headship to some woman of doubtful origin......"`
`"Don't talk stupid...!`
` You weren't even going to succeed Father as head in the first place...!`
` We have nothin' to lose and money to gain.`
` Sure, we'll have to calculate our profit and loss, but it's somethin' worth listenin' to...!"`
`They knew that much of the Ushiromiya family assets had been eaten up by Krauss.`
`The dregs that remained of that inheritance...versus the "compensation for being accepted as the head" that {f:5:Beatrice} would pay.`
`It was a shame, but honestly, the former was less enticing than the latter.`
`"...Well, it probably wouldn't end up as four equal portions.`
` Since Aniki would be giving up his position of successor, his portion would have to be larger.`
` ...Makes me feel kinda jealous, you know?"`
`"................................."`
`"Dear...!`
` The amount of money isn't the problem, right?!`
` Your cowardly younger siblings are trying to sell the glory of the Ushiromiya family for money!`
` Why aren't you displaying your dignity as the eldest son?!"`
`".........Natsuhi.`
` Stay quiet for a while."`
`"Dear?!?!"`
`"......This is a dizzying proposal.`
` ......We were each planning on getting 250 million yen out of Aniki.`
` If the witch would treat us with even ten percent of those ten tons...`
`......ummm—"`
`"That's 2 billion."`
`"...Yeah.`
` That would mean she's treating us with ten times our original goal.`
` That alone would be more than enough for us.`
` ......It's not like I have any attachment to the Ushiromiya name.`
` I'd be happy to sell it off..."`
`"Even if the full ten tons might be a bit much to expect,`
` .........I see, it would still be an attractive prospect for us.`
` ...We were trying to form an alliance among the siblings to kick this outsider called {f:5:Beatrice} out."`
`"......But, if this is her plan,`
` ......it will tear apart the unity between us.`
` ...Yes, by this point we can state it clearly.`
` ......The goal of {f:5:Beatrice}'s letter was to disturb our alliance."`
`If the three younger siblings, who were never going to have any connection with the succession of the headship in the first place,`
` were paid enough money to satisfy them, they would happily accept {f:5:Beatrice} as the next head.`
`So every obstacle to her headship would be removed except for Krauss.`
`In that case, the negotiations would be one‐on‐one between her and Krauss.`
`He tried to look strong, but Krauss's financial and political situation was extremely weak.`
`{n}...He did bluff in front of his siblings, but on the inside, he was probably thinking that it might be alright to enter negotiations depending on the sum of money involved.`
`In order to bury his losses, Krauss had taken advantage of the fact that Kinzo had shut himself up in his room, and had embezzled Kinzo's personal assets.`
`Therefore, when Kinzo died and the inheritance was distributed, Krauss would be held to account for that.`
`But if he gave up his seat as the head to {f:5:Beatrice},`
` she would also receive the rights to the assets, and as a result, the distribution of the inheritance to the siblings would not occur.`
`......In other words, Krauss' embezzlement might not have to be made known to the other siblings...`
`Of course, the siblings were frightened of Kinzo, but it was doubtful whether they still actually respected him as a father.`
`By this time, they each had their own families, their own wealth, and their own lives.`
`If they were paid enough money in exchange for Rokkenjima, the wrecked remains of Kinzo's dreams,`
` ......there was a significant possibility that they would relinquish the Ushiromiya family name......`
`In other words, {f:5:Beatrice}'s victory was already guaranteed in this "game".`
`Not as the winner of "{f:5:Beatrice}'s game",`
`{n}...but as the winner of "Kinzo's game".`
`...Kinzo had put up the epitaph.`
`{n}And to this day, no one had been able to solve it.`
`So {f:5:Beatrice} had "solved" it.`
`In other words, this is less of a game and more like {f:5:Beatrice}'s declaration of victory...`
`However, Kyrie still felt something was slightly out of place.`
`If this was a declaration of victory, {f:5:Beatrice} would only have to display the gold openly, and state that she would buy the family headship.`
`And yet, even at this late stage, she was explicitly telling the siblings to try to solve the epitaph.`
` Why had she set up this "new game", where she agreed to hand over the all of the gold and the right to succeed the head to the person who solved the epitaph?`
`Kyrie tried flipping over the chessboard several times.`
`{n}...Searching for the best strategy that might have guided {f:5:Beatrice} to this line of thinking.`
`...In the end, ...she reached a single conclusion.`
`"...............Arrogance,`
` ...perhaps?`
` Or maybe,`
` ......she's playing......?"`
`"...What are you talking about?"`
`"The witch sent us a letter of challenge, telling us to try to solve the epitaph.`
` She might be taking us lightly, thinking we could never solve it.`
` ......However, there should be at least an extremely small chance that we will solve it."`
`"After all, we have here four of Father's children by blood, right?`
` Four people related by blood to the questioner, who, if they tried frantically to work together and avoid having those assets stolen from them,`
` might come across the answer of the riddle by chance."`
`The reason the witch had a superior position on the negotiations compared to the siblings was that only she knew the location of the hidden gold.`
`But if that hiding place was exposed to someone other than her, the witch's superior position would crumble.`
`"In short, {f:5:Beatrice} gains nothing but risk by writing this witch's letter of challenge."`
`"......Of course, it might have had the effect of splitting apart the siblings' alliance,`
` but if that was her only goal, why would she take this risk, however slight it might be......?`
` I think that's reckless."`
`"...But if you keep in mind a certain type of emotion, it becomes possible to understand that risk."`
`"..................`
` ...And you're saying that's arrogance?"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` ......When people have an overwhelming advantage, they tend to get arrogant.`
` And when they do, they sometimes deliberately take on a small risk, to show off that advantage to the losers."`
`"......A moderate amount of risk adds a little spice to the joy of victory.`
` Nothing is as boring as a victory without risk."`
`"...............I understand that.`
` I also like that sort of thing.`
` ...I understand well."`
`"I tried thinking of a few other plausible explanations for the true motive behind {f:5:Beatrice}'s letter,`
` ......but I think that this really might be the truth.`
` ......The emotion hidden behind that letter...`
`......was arrogance."`
`"............Arrogance."`
`"She's trying to throw her weight around, looking down on us, as if there's no way we could figure out such a difficult epitaph.`
` ...It might even be possible, if surprising, that the epitaph wasn't written by Father, but by her."`
`"......Fine by me.`
` ......Solve the riddle of the epitaph, she says?"`
`If only I solved it, I would be made the head, right...?`
`...I'll solve it...`
` I'll accept the witch's challenge.`
`As if my other braindead siblings could solve it.`
`I'll solve it by myself, and then I'll prove that I am the one who is fit to succeed the Ushiromiya family......`
`"I'll take that challenge.`
` ...I will...`
`solve the riddle......"`
`"...I see...`
` So, not a witch, but a mistress by the name of {f:5:Beatrice} did exist on the island..."`
`"......So there can be more than 18 people!`
` Which means I can defeat that line of reasoning which says that, if it was impossible for all 18 people, it must be a crime involving magic.`
` ......That's some big information."`
`"Excuse me.`
` Battler‐sama, would you care for some black tea and cookies?"`
`Beato's butler, who called himself Ronove, appeared out of nowhere in particular.`
`Placed upon the silver tray that he held was a plate filled with delicious‐looking, steaming black tea and cookies.`
`...I really don't like this guy's smile.`
`{n}For some reason, it doesn't look like a smile used to warmly greet a guest.`
`{n}It feels like he's making fun of me for some reason.`
`...I don't know whether he really takes me for an idiot,`
` or whether it's just a joke or something, but it's really irritating me.`
`"......I don't want any.`
` I'm busy right now.`
` Leave me alone."`
`"Oh, my.`
` That is a shame, when the cookies have turned out oh so very delicious.`
` Cooked so wonderfully it is a shame to waste them on a simple {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, truly wonderful cookies."`
`"I'll eat some when I feel like it.`
` Set it down somewhere over there and get out of here."`
`"Will that be acceptable?`
` Then I shall do so.`
` You may eat them when they get cold and stale, and then regret as much as you like that you did not eat them when they were freshly baked."`
`".........You really are annoying.`
` ...Well, you're a lot better than that Beato, who keeps doing that creepy cackle right next to my ear."`
`"Oh, yes, yes, that is quite true.`
` There are times when Milady's laughter becomes quite undignified.`
` Every time I hear it, I think of my noble rank,`
` and struggle to comprehend why I must have such a person as my master.`
` Pu ku ku ku..."`
`"......Man you're weird.`
` If you don't like it, then couldn't you just not work for her?"`
`"To continue serving despite that is furniture's joy.`
` One could not serve as furniture without such an attitude."`
`"......Let us set that aside.`
` How has the game been proceeding?`
` Just now, I believe I heard you say that you had found some good information, and were quite pleased by it.`
` Well now, I wonder what your shallow wit has thought up."`
`As Ronove made fun of me and giggled,`
` he followed my earlier words to the letter and placed the black tea and cookies somewhere arbitrary nearby.`
`"......I imagine it is because you have gained increased confidence in the existence of a 19th person?`
` Would you be gracious enough to allow me to hear your opinion?"`
`"..................`
` ......Yeah, sure.`
` I'm just going to say it again in front of Beato anyway.`
` No reason to hide it."`
`"......Alright.`
` It looks like there's a hidden mansion somewhere on this island, and that Grandfather had his mistress living there.`
` In that case, the question that's been torturing me, about whether there are 18 or 19 people, can be easily resolved."`
`"Although you deny witches,`
` you hold a double standard by refusing to seek a culprit among the 18, and have driven yourself into a dead‐end."`
`"...The easiest way to deny the witch would be to doubt one of the 18.`
` ......It's not so easy for every one of the 18 to have an alibi.`
` You always find at least one person with a fragile alibi.`
` ......I could probably continue to deny the witch forever if I just used that person as a sacrifice."`
`"However, I will steadfastly refuse to do that!!`
` Yeah, that's no good, that's no goddamn good at all!`
` Every one of those 18 people is either a parent, a relative or a cousin to me!`
` And those reliable servants, who are sometimes serious and sometimes funny.`
` I won't let myself use any one of them as a sacrifice!!"`
`"In the past, my resolve wavered.`
` That's how Beato hit me where my heart was weak."`
`"......Accepting and understanding your own weaknesses.`
` That is not something which can often be accomplished.`
` Battler‐sama, you are using this theory about a 19th person as a spear.`
` ...Or should I say, a shield?"`
`"In any event, unlike how unprepared you were in the games up until now,`
` let us call the fact that you now have a compass bearing on how to fight...a dramatic leap forward.`
` With this, you need not doubt any of the 18 you love and respect,`
` and can easily suspect a 19th person, and pursue your theory that the culprit is a human."`
`"That's it exactly.`
` Like in the first game, when Kanon‐kun was killed in the boiler room,`
` ...and a bunch of other places,`
` there are countless tricks I can use without hesitation if a 19th person existed."`
`In the very first game, Kanon‐kun had been killed in the boiler room.`
`One might think that he was attacked by Kumasawa‐san, who had gone down into the boiler room with him,`
` or maybe that someone who had appeared to be dead earlier was actually faking,`
` and had ambushed Kanon‐kun in the boiler room.`
` Either way, it was a move that forced me to suspect one of the 18.`
`However, by simply proposing that a 19th person exists,`
` there's no longer any need to suspect one of the 18 for that murder in the boiler room.`
`"In short!`
` "Impossible for any of the 18 = The culprit is a witch"...`
` is an equation that I can now deny."`
`Using this argument, we can take, for example, the question which has been raised once again in this game,`
` "who gave Maria the letter?",`
` and come up with an easy explanation.`
` Even if all 18 people have alibis,`
` I can easily explain everything by saying that a 19th person visited her and gave her the letter.`
`".........Hmm, hmm.`
` I think that is quite a good move.`
` How would I strike back?"`
`"......Battler‐sama, despite your understanding, there are still plenty of weak points.`
` Perhaps the "18 people attack" will be an effective move.`
` As an attempt to judge how strong your defense is, it may be interesting to attack from that angle again."`
`"Then how would you do it,`
` demon butler...?!"`
`"......I believe it would be appropriate to attack this 19th piece that you have played.`
` Battler‐sama, have you ever met this 19th person?`
` May I ask you for some proof that this 19th person exists?"`
`"How naive.`
` Of course, I knew you'd probably try that move...!"`
`"My, my.`
` Please respond to it."`
`"Witches and demons and the like...`
` There's no move more appropriate for you than this one.`
` ......And that is—"`
`"The "Devil's Proof"!"`
`When we humans are accused of something, we always counterattack by saying to show some evidence.`
` Because that's a human move.`
`But I'm fighting with a witch.`
`{n}I'm taking part in a battle with someone who isn't human!`
`And some moves exist which can only be used in a game against a witch.`
`{n}There are cheap moves!`
`And that's what this "Devil's Proof" is.`
`{n}Therefore, evidence is unnecessary!`
`Let's take the assumption that there is a hidden mansion on Rokkenjima separate from the Ushiromiya family mansion,`
` and that a woman named {f:5:Beatrice} is living there.`
`In order to prove this, one must find this mansion and actually bring {f:5:Beatrice} out of it.`
`That's called actual proof in the human world.`
`However, if we follow the rules of the "Devil's Proof", you can't disprove that she exists, even if there's no evidence that she does.`
`Because it's impossible to prove that something doesn't exist.`
`......That's right, this "Devil's Proof", which tormented me so much before, I've finally managed to use to my own advantage.`
`Those guys were always trying to force me to accept the existence of the witch by using the "Devil's Proof".`
`That was because, in response to Beato's professions that witches do exist,`
` I physically could not offer any proof that "witches don't exist".`
`That is why I have been subjected to this nonsense that witches exist, and why I have been unable to counterattack.`
`And that's why I'll flip over the chessboard right now!`
`If I can't disprove that witches exist, then that means,`
` if I suggest that a 19th human exists, you can't disprove that either.`
`In other words, the enigmatic mistress in question is craftily hiding herself, so it's perfectly natural that you can never find her no matter how hard you look.`
`So you can't say that "The 19th person can't be found = The 19th person doesn't exist".`
`Therefore, it is impossible to disprove a 19th person.`
`{n}Beato used the "Devil's Proof" to make denying her existence impossible,`
` but this time it's become my weapon.`
`If we can get away with this argument, then never mind a 19th person,`
` this island could be full of people we don't know about,`
` and even if there are ten or a hundred of them hiding, she still can't disprove that they exist.`
`In the last game and the one before that, among the murder scenes that showed up, there were several that were extremely intricate and must have taken a lot of effort to set up.`
`It's very difficult to imagine that a single culprit could have set all of those up.`
`However, if not just a 19th person, but ten or a hundred people were hidden somewhere, that wouldn't be any problem at all.`
`If they all split up the work, they could handle any job in a short period of time.`
`Of course, doubts will naturally arise at whether a large group of people like that could sneak around the mansion without being noticed,`
` but those are all settled by the "Devil's Proof".`
`Because not seeing or not noticing a hundred people inside the mansion does not disprove that they were there.`
`Even though I'm saying it myself, it's such a stupid argument that it makes me wanna throw up!`
` However, it's because it's such a dirty‐as‐hell move that makes it the perfect one to use against a witch.`
`Well, we're only imagining here,`
` ...but the thought of about a hundred suspicious men wearing goat masks hiding in the shadows......`
` That goes beyond "funny", makes me think of cockroaches.`
`If you see one, it means there's a hundred hiding in the shadows.`
`"......Well, I do think this is a ridiculous argument that's horribly twisted.`
` If my opponent was human, I'm sure they'd yell at me like I was out of my mind."`
`"......But my opponent is a witch.`
` And after all, that is the kind of competition we're having, isn't it?`
` I'll use any kind of reckless argument to explain it using humans, and deny the witch!!"`
`"......Anyway, with this move, I'll never again have to doubt any of the 18 who are close to me.`
` I will never again repeat the defeat I suffered last time...!!"`
`"......I see.`
` You have learned from your defeat last time.`
` That is good.`
` It is no surprise that by the third game you have become quite devious."`
`".........You first strengthen your own defense.`
` That is truly a solid first step.`
` Quite a spectacular move, I think."`
`"Well, even if we do assume that there is a 19th person,`
` there are still a few tricks left that I can't get past no matter how many humans I add, like the number of master keys.`
` ...Still, it isn't bad as a first step, for the time being."`
`"This is your trump card, the important piece known as the 19th person.`
` ......You countered my move of asking for evidence by using the "Devil's Proof".`
` ......A good skirmish."`
`"Although I have no excuse for making moves by myself when Milady is absent,`
` .........I find that I too have become slightly interested.`
` ...I wonder if you would permit me to make yet another move on Milady's behalf?"`
`"......Go for it.`
` I don't care if you're a witch or a demon, I'll take you all on!"`
`"The move that you made, the "Devil's Proof".`
` It is a specialty of us demons, but there are also various other moves available to us.`
` ......Do you know of a move called "Hempel's Raven"?"`
`"Hempel's Raven...??`
` What are you talking about?"`
`"...*cackle*cackle*.`
` Ah‐ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah‐ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah‐hah‐ha...!"`
`Just then, ...aah, that laugh, which gets on my nerves every time I hear it, started echoing around.`
`The room was filled with dazzling golden butterflies, and in the center of that whirlwind, the Golden Witch appeared.`
`"Why, if it isn't Milady.`
` Good morning."`
`"I thought you might be doing something interesting while I was away."`
`"......‘Hempel's Raven’, was it?`
` What an amusing and nostalgic move.`
` To think the day would come when it would be introduced to Battler.`
` It's a classic move to use against the "Devil's Proof"."`
`"......Ronove, I will make this move.`
` Do not get in the way of my fun."`
`"So you've finally shown up, you guffawing witch.`
` I see you still have that undignified laugh.`
` ......This guy was talking behind your back just now, telling me about how your laughing lacks class.`
` Right?"`
`"I am offended.`
` Is that true?"`
`"By no means.`
` I have only words of the highest heartfelt respect for Milady;`
` why would I speak such gossip?"`
`"...I can't believe you can say that so brazenly.`
` Doesn't look like we'll be getting along well together..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` Well, that is fine.`
` Let us return to the conversation.`
` "Hempel's Raven" is used to show proof using the contrapositive."`
`"......Essentially, it is a move like this:`
` What must you do to prove that ravens are black?"`
`"Huh?`
` What are you talking about??`
` Prove that ravens are black...`
` ...Wouldn't you just have to catch the ravens and check to see if they're black?"`
`"That is right.`
` You must simply prove that "if it is a raven, it is black".`
` And do you see that, if you prove that "if a bird is not black, it is not a raven", you would reach the same argument?"`
`"If you go throughout the world and examine all birds that are not ravens, and prove that none of them are black,`
` then as a result, you can claim that "therefore, birds that are black are ravens".`
` This is called an argument by the contrapositive.`
` ...Is that difficult for you?"`
`"Yeah, no kidding.`
` ...I have no idea what you're saying."`
`"Battler‐sama.`
` What about this example?`
` Let us say that you have two boxes, and one of them is the winner, with a cookie inside.`
` Of course, the other one is the loser, and is empty."`
`For example, let us say that we have two boxes here,`
` one being the winner with a cookie inside, and the other being the loser, which is empty.`
`Now, it holds that "if there is a cookie inside, it is the winner",`
` and at the same time, it also holds that "if it is not the winner, there is no cookie inside".`
`When such a relationship exists, we call the latter the contrapositive...`
`When "if A then B" is true, then at the same time, "if not B then not A" is also true.`
`"...Well, that's obvious.`
` If the one you picked was the loser, then you would automatically know that the other one was the winner."`
`"...In other words, if you choose the box at random, whether it's the winner or the loser,`
` you'll be able to figure out which box has the cookie in it after your first move."`
`"That is correct.`
` If the cookie is in the box you open, then the "Devil's Proof" is satisfied.`
` You can prove directly that "this box is the winner = this box has a cookie in it"."`
`"However, if the box that you open is empty, then the reverse, "Hempel's Raven", is satisfied.`
` Because then, it holds that "this box does not have a cookie in it = this box is not the winner"."`
`"And that means, as long as we accept the premise that there are no more than two boxes,`
` the contrapositive shows that the other box is automatically the winner."`
`"......Well, I think I'm starting to see your reasoning.`
` Only poison can stop poison, and only twisted logic can stop twisted logic."`
`"...Then what?`
` How does that overturn my claim that "no doubt there is a 19th human hidden on this island,`
` so even if all of the 18 people have alibis,`
` that does not amount to an acceptance of witches"......?"`
`"Very well.`
` I will tell you my move.`
` First of all, you are stating that "if the culprit is not among the 18, then the culprit is a 19th person"."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` ...So if you use the contrapositive, it ends up like this.`
` In short, "if the culprit is not a 19th person, then the culprit is one of the 18"!"`
`"Whaah?!`
` What the, what does that mean?!"`
`"All I have done is turn your move on its head.`
` It shouldn't be that difficult to understand.`
` Ronove, explain.`
` It seems your cookie‐in‐a‐box analogy from before will be easy for Battler to understand."`
`"Then forgive my presumption.`
` Allow me to explain using my earlier example once more."`
`Allow me to repeat once more my earlier story,`
` about two treasure chests, one of which has a cookie in it.`
`In this situation, one of the boxes represents "the 18 people", and the other box represents "the 19th person".`
`So the cookie would represent the "culprit".`
`Battler‐sama, you open the 18 box.`
`{n}Because the cookie is not there,`
` you have proven from the opposite direction that "therefore, the cookie is in the 19 box".`
`In that case, if we reverse things further, we can also say the following.`
`Namely, if it was first shown that the 19 box was empty,`
` it would prove in just the same way that "the cookie is in the 18 box".`
`Battler‐sama, this move you played in order to avoid having to doubt any of the 18,`
` has in fact been used against you to launch the "18 person attack"...!"`
`"......Huh,`
` ......what did you say........."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` If I go first and prove that the inside of the 19 box is empty,`
` automatically,`
` you will be forced to accept that the cookie is in the 18 box.`
` All you have done is say this the other way around, you see?"`
`"So, ......that move that I was so confident in, ...was actually a double‐edged sword?"`
`"That's right.`
` Your move to explain everything with a 19th person carries the risk that, if it is thwarted,`
` you will be forced to accept that you can only explain things by using the 18."`
`I see...`
` "Hempel's Raven".`
`{n}......So this is a countering technique?!`
`...Wait, if I really think about it, this countering technique is far more disadvantageous for me than for her.`
`The problem is in thinking about it like a cookie.`
`{n}If I imagine that just one of the treasure chests is a "losing" chest with a bomb in it, I can begin to understand it quite well.`
`And if I think of it not as two treasure chests,`
` but as 18, one for each person, plus one more for the 19th person,`
` for a total of 19 boxes, it gets even easier to understand.`
`First of all, one of the premises established by the human culprit theory was that the bomb would definitely be in one of those boxes.`
`Because I hadn't wanted to place that bomb in any of the 18's boxes, I had used the "Devil's Proof",`
` and created the 19th box so that I could throw the bomb in there.`
` ......That much was alright.`
`But Beato had struck back like this:`
`If, then, the 19th box was empty inside,`
` that would automatically mean that the bomb was set in one of the other 18 boxes.`
`If I could examine the contents of each of the 18's boxes,`
` and show that the bomb was not in any one of those boxes,`
` I would be able to safely show that the 18 people were innocent.`
`If that was possible, I would be feeling confident!`
`However, in reality, that's as close as you can get to impossible.`
`The police wouldn't come here in this typhoon.`
`{n}There would be no scientific investigations, no autopsies, no nothing.`
`{n}In short, I can't show anything decisively!`
`It's impossible for me to find any proof other than simply gulping down whatever alibis each of the 18 give.`
`In that case, I have to confirm their innocence both personally and perfectly.`
`Like staying with someone the whole time, never letting them out of my sight for a second.`
`If I do that, I can probably be sure of that person's innocence,`
` and that the bomb is not in that box.`
`...However, in reality, something like that is impossible!`
`{n}In other words, I have to expend an incredible effort just to check the contents of one box.`
`And there are 18 of them!`
` In other words, unless I bind all 18 of them in chains and watch over them,`
` it's impossible to prove that all of them have empty boxes.`
`However, Beato only has to open one box, the 19th box,`
` and show that it is empty, to prove that the bomb is in one of the other 18 boxes.`
` (Furthermore, there's no need for her to show {i:which} of the 18 boxes has the bomb!)`
`I have 18 times more work to do to explain my pet theory than Beato does for hers......`
`"Just as you know from the "Devil's Proof",`
` there are many cases in this world where refuting something would take a vast amount of effort that is impossible in practice."`
`"However, "Hempel's Raven" turns that problem around, and makes it possible to prove things easily!"`
`"By using "Hempel's Raven", various reckless arguments become possible to prove."`
`"......For example, let us say that I make the proposition "All humans except me are foolish".`
` Normally, in order to prove this, I would have to examine all of humanity except myself and show that they are all foolish."`
`"...However, in reality, it would be impossible to investigate billions of people.`
` It is exactly the same kind of effort you would need to open all 18 boxes."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` However, by using "Hempel's Raven", the contrapositive of that proposition would change it as follows."`
`"Essentially, take this "All humans except me are foolish", and to use your style of phrase,`
` flip over the chessboard, and you merely need prove that "not foolish = me".`
` ......And what do you think that means?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` As soon as I know the fact that "I am wise",`
` I finish proving in an instant that every one of the billions of people in the human race is foolish.`
` In less than a second, I can finish proving that the entire human race is more foolish than me!!"`
`"It's the strongest and fastest QED in the world.`
` This...`
`is "Hempel's Raven"!"`
`"Wha‐.........what a ridiculous argument.........!!!"`
`"It is a very, very convenient move.`
` Not only demons, but gods also use it.`
` When you propose "blessed = God's servant",`
` the contrapositive is "if a human is not a servant of God, then he must not be blessed"."`
`"So in order for servants of God to prove that they are granted fortune by their divine protection,`
` they only have to prove that those who don't receive that divine protection suffer misfortune."`
`".........Therefore,`
` by bringing misfortune down upon those people who don't believe in their own god, they prove their own blessedness."`
`"It takes an enormous cost to give humans happiness.`
` ...However, the necessary cost to bring humans misfortune is much cheaper."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` So by using "Hempel's Raven", gods can actually give believers the joy of divine protection at the lowest cost."`
`"Y‐......you demon.`
` It's a demon's argument...`
` ...That's messed up...!!!"`
`"It seems that we've gone off‐topic.`
` Let us return to it."`
`"I have finished describing the move for my counterattack.`
` ......The counterattack to your claim that "a 19th person is the culprit; therefore, the 18 are innocent and the witch doesn't exist" is:`
` "In that case, if I can prove that the culprit is not some 19th person,`
` do we agree that the culprit must either be one of the 18, or a witch?".`
` I await your answer."`
`For a while, I just stood there, shocked, completely forgetting to close my mouth...`
`Just when I'd thought that I'd got my own back on them by using their favorite move against them,`
` the counterattack to that had been this reckless argument that I could not even have begun to imagine...!`
`Was it really...impossible...?!`
`To continue denying the witch on an island with no more than 18 people,`
` and yet still believe in the innocence of those 18 people...`
` .........Was that just a delusion?!`
` Was I just trying to escape reality?!`
`Not yet...`
` ......Don't give up this struggle yet.`
`Who cares about "Whoever's Raven"?`
`{n}They're just trying to speak in riddles by bringing up some weird bits of trivia...`
`I had used the "Devil's Proof".`
`{n}Don't feel doubt in something once you've used it.`
`{n}Believe in the spear you've lunged forward with.`
`Apply even more force......and gouge it in......!`
`"......The game is still in the opening.`
` Do you already intend to spend this long thinking?"`
`"........................`
` Ah,`
` ......wait a sec,`
` I want to be sure."`
`"While yes, I did use the phrasing of a "19th person" to make it easy to understand,`
` if I can use the "Devil's Proof" to raise the number of people above 18,`
` then what I mean is an unspecified large number of extra people—you don't know if it's ten or a hundred."`
`"{i:Always one more than you assume}.`
` ...Understand?"`
`She had returned my twisted logic with something even more twisted.`
`{n}So the only thing that could counter that would be even crazier twisted logic...!`
`"Hmm, I see.`
` .........Even if I somehow prove an alibi for the 19th person,`
` as soon as I do, you will think up a 20th person, and claim that they are the culprit.`
` By repeating this infinitely, you would make it so I kept searching for their alibis for all eternity."`
`"......I see, I see, *cackle*cackle*!`
` Just like a demon king summoning a plague of locusts.`
` I wouldn't expect anything less from Kinzo's grandchild.`
` It looks like you have been gifted with a talent in summoning."`
`"......In short!`
` It is impossible to continually prove an alibi for the "X" existing outside of the first 18!`
` ......How do you like that, Beato...?!`
` Now that I know we're having a battle with twisted logic, I won't lose!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` How foolish...`
` Who do you think I am?`
` I am the Endless Witch, the Infinite Witch!`
` For you to challenge me at infinity is absurd.`
` Having control over infinity means also that I am able to kill infinity."`
`"......When your 19th person folds, you will call a 20th,`
` and when your 20th person folds, you will call a 21st,`
` and when your 21st person folds and your 22nd person folds,`
` you will call a 23rd, a 34th, a 64358223579673204th,`
` you think you can trifle with me for all eternity?!"`
`"I laugh at "infinite regress",`
` the {i:infinite} doesn't affect me!!"`
`"Hoh, well then, how will you kill my "infinity"? Just try and show me!!"`
`"`
`{p:1:I have the power to speak the truth in red}!!!"`
`".....................!!`
` .........Here it comes............"`
`"When I speak in red, it contains absolutely no illusions.`
` If I say once in red that there are no more than 100 people on this island,`
` you will no longer be permitted to create a 101st person."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Come now, Battlerrr.`
` What truth shall I tell in red this time?`
` Where shall I strike for the kill and force you into hopelessness?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Come, show me your usual frightened face......"`
`".............................."`
`"..................What?"`
`"......Ihihihihi."`
`"...Why...are you laughing...?"`
`I wonder what kind of creepy look I had on my face as I laughed right then.`
`{n}That red sure is scary.`
` ...Every time it jumps out, I'm driven into the depths of hopelessness.`
`But......I had already realized it.`
`{n}...There was no need to be unnecessarily afraid of the red.`
`".........You've brought out your secret weapon again.`
` So...?`
` What and how will the great {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama speak in red this time?"`
`"......Hoh.`
` What do you mean by this?`
` Suddenly looking so relaxed..."`
`"Sorry, but I've been waiting for you to take out that blood‐red treasured sword.`
` ......Let's see, what will you proclaim in red this time?"`
`"You aren't going to say "the culprit was one of the 18", are you?`
` Let me warn you, that would be self‐destruction, remember?`
` That would be the same as throwing away your own witch theory yourself.`
` A complete resignation."`
`That's right.`
` The red isn't always necessarily to Beato's advantage.`
` On the contrary, if she used it the wrong way, it's dangerous enough that she could bring about her own death.`
` If she used it carelessly and said something which ended up denying herself, that would be exactly the same thing as self‐destructing.`
`"Of course,`
` it would also be sad and difficult for me to accept if you told me in red that one of the 18 was the culprit.`
` ......No matter who the culprit actually was, it would surely bring me some tough emotions..."`
`"But before that, it would mean your defeat!`
` Saying in red that the culprit is a human is equivalent to your proclamation of resignation!!`
` If you want to strike me a blow so badly you're prepared to die at the same time, I think that's a pretty interesting move.`
` However, this battle will end in my victory!!"`
`{f:5:Beatrice}'s red was truly her secret weapon, her treasured blade.`
` The things she spoke in red would become solidified as the truth, and no amount of evidence or counterarguments could change them.`
`They had cut me down to size many times now, rending in two any supports my heart had to lean on.`
`However, if she used it carelessly, then I could also find a little information about the truth.`
`...In the last game, especially during the chapel's locked room trick, I had taken advantage of that,`
` and had once closed her in almost completely.`
`But she was also pretty sly.`
` She had learned from experience, and since then, had started using discretion in the timing of the red...`
`This feeling of tension was almost literally like a battle with real swords.`
`...This was a battle of high intelligence.`
`{n}......No, not of intelligence.`
`{n}It really was twisted logic.`
`This was the world's craziest and worst battle of twisted logic...!!`
`"So, now it's your move.`
` ......That's right.`
` To use your "Hempel's Raven",`
` first, you'll have to confirm in red how many humans there are other than the 18."`
`"And after that, if you proclaim in red that none of the people in that group are the culprit,`
` ......that's right, that might be a fatal wound to me."`
`".........I'm surprised that you no longer have even an atom of fear for that red which you feared so much...`
` You're quite sturdy."`
`"Unsheathe it.`
` Your treasured blade.`
` ......A single perfect swing, and you might be able to break me this time, who knows...?"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` ...Interesting.`
` I wouldn't have it any other way..."`
`Agitate her.`
` Provoke her.`
`{n}Drive her into a corner to make her speak in red...`
`Of course her red has always cut right through my only threads of hope.`
` But......don't be afraid of that.`
`On this island overcome with falsehoods and illusions, the only thing I can trust...`
`is the information that she speaks in red.`
`It is my only way across the chasm of Hell.`
` Just a single tightrope.`
`Her merciless blood‐red blade is the only way I can survive.`
`...This isn't just walking on a tightrope, it's literally like walking on the edge of a blade...`
`Of course I'm afraid.`
` In terms of her contrapositive, my victory condition—the denial of the witch—meant that the culprit was a human.`
`But I didn't want to search for the culprit amid the 18.`
`...Therefore, I held on to a weak point, since I had to deny the witch and the 18 at the same time.`
` Since I had been unable to understand that last time, that was where she had hit me, leaving me tattered and defeated.`
`......But that's alright.`
`{n}Let her hit me.`
` Let her attack.`
` No problem...`
`Someone said it once in an old sword‐fighting movie.`
`{n}That "a good fortress has one, and only one, intentionally weak point".`
`The enemy would gather there.`
` They would be lured there.`
`{n}And that would be where the actual battle took place.`
`...As long as I understand my weak points,`
` and as long as she wants to attack those weak points,`
` ......it's as if I've induced her to attack there...`
`Carefully judge the distance from your enemy, ...and retreat step by step.`
` Make them draw their sword first.`
`The more she recklessly flourishes that red, the more chances I'll have to strike back.`
`Don't be afraid of the red.`
`{n}Keep the pressure on, so that she is forced to refute with the red......!`
`No matter how oppressively she speaks in red,`
` ......yes, that red itself is the same as fresh blood spurting from her wounds.`
`"Come on.`
` ...What's wrong?`
` ......First of all, why don't you tell me in red how many people are on this island total?`
` If you don't, your raven can't cut me up......!"`
`".....................Hmph.`
` ...How surprising that you can be this desperate and yet this difficult.`
` ...One cannot make light of someone putting their life on the line, no matter what the era."`
`"......It's no surprise you're Kinzo's grandchild.`
` The more cornered you are,`
` ............the bolder you become!"`
`"...Ihihihi..."`
`Ronove cleared his throat.`
`"You appear to be at a standstill.`
` That black tea I worked so hard to make is getting cold,`
` Milady."`
`".........kh."`
`Ronove, who was supposed to be her ally, roguishly rushed her next move.`
`Beato smiled back, probably intending to demonstrate that she was still relaxed, ......but she couldn't hide the sweat building up on her forehead.`
`By now she had completely lost that relaxedness which had allowed her to turn her nose up at her worthless opponent.`
`Of course, she probably wasn't really cornered by something like this.`
` ...She was just...being cautious.`
`Until now, I had been inexperienced.`
`{n}I didn't have a good grasp on how to fight, and I was underpowered as an opponent.`
`However, now that we had reached the third game, she realized that I was starting to become skilled,`
` and she had grown more cautious, thinking every move over carefully......`
`Sure, that's just fine, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}And sorry to have kept you waiting.`
`{n}Are you happy now...?`
`"......Now things are starting to get interesting, right......?`
` Hihihihi!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` ...Battleeeeerrrrr......"`
`"This isn't going anywhere...`
` Then, should I just dive right in and go with the usual?"`
`"......Hoh.`
` The usual, you say.`
` ...Then by all means.`
` If I don't hear that, I guess I just won't get the sense that we've started..."`
`The first move was mine......`
`"Here I come, Beato."`
`"Repetition requested.`
` ......‘There are only 18 people on this island’."`
`"....................."`
`"...If I hear you say this in red, I will have no choice but to doubt one of the 18.`
` ......Since it could no longer be the work of a 19th person, all doors will be closed to me."`
`".........But I believe that the culprit is definitely not one of the 18!`
` There's no way that any of those 18 could commit such brutal murders...!!"`
`"....................."`
`"I'll say it again.`
` Repetition requested!`
` "There are only 18 people on this island"."`
`"..............................`
` .........I decline.`
` I won't say why."`
`Whew...!`
` I had avoided what would have been the worst red for me.`
`If she had repeated that,`
` I would have been faced with those two worst choices of accepting the witch or suspecting one of the 18,`
` like last time all over again...`
`But Beato had not proclaimed my ultimate and greatest weakness in red.`
`She had declined to repeat it—even though there was no reason why she shouldn't have struck—even though it was a weakness she should have been drooling at.`
`She hadn't sliced me up with red by using that move, which should have been as good as forking a rook and the king...!`
`......This was a big sign of my advantage.`
`That's right.`
` The culprit isn't one of the 18 people.`
`{n}I won't doubt anyone...!`
`And since the culprit isn't a witch either,`
` .........it means that a 19th person exists on this island.`
`And that's you.`
`A person who, as Grandfather's mistress of thirty years,`
` has been living secretly in a hidden mansion in the forest for a long, long time.`
`The {i:human} {f:5:Beatrice}.........!!`
`"That's right.`
` You aren't a witch or anything like it.`
` ......You're just a human...who's been living on this island in hiding for several decades...!"`
`".........*cackle*cackle*.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*...`
` ...Did you just call me, the Endless Witch who has lived for over one thousand years, a mere human?`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`For a while, {f:5:Beatrice} continued to laugh unpleasantly, gloating or maybe spiteful.`
`"...Are you ready? I'll keep going.`
` ...Again, repetition requested."`
`"‘There are at least 19 people on this island’!"`
`".............................."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} fell silent once again.`
`The feeling that confirming the number of humans on this island...`
`might possibly stand to give her some large disadvantage,`
` was probably making her extremely cautious.`
`The red had already become a foothold for my counterattack.`
` With that in mind, the red had become a risk for the witch.`
`But if she couldn't repeat this, her "Hempel's Raven" wouldn't work.`
`In order to break my "Devil's Proof",`
` first, the existence of and number of people outside the 18...`
`needed to be confirmed in red.`
`That's right.`
` She couldn't break the existence of a 19th person unless she used red.`
`I had {i:closed Beato in}, giving her no choice but to speak in red...!`
`There really was...`
`.........a way to fight,`
` ......in this witch's game!`
`"It's alright to decline.`
` ...If you can't say it in red, then that will mean the total number of people on this island will be 18+X."`
`"......That X is a pretty huge piece to allow me to have on the first move, isn't it?`
` After all, from then on, all of the tricks with the basis "it was impossible for any of the 18"...`
`will become explainable with a human X outside of the 18 people.`
` ......This is a huge piece that can break open any locked room hinging on everyone having an alibi...!"`
`It was just like...`
`a bishop in chess, which can cut a thin line through enemy forces as long as there's a slight gap.`
` It only exerts an effect over squares of the same color, but it has a great ability to control the board.`
`"..............................`
` ..................kh."`
`It looked like Beato also well understood her current plight.`
`She couldn't just let such an important piece go, especially this close to the beginning of the game...`
`If she pulled out her red treasured sword, it wouldn't be that difficult to save that piece.`
`......But Beato was completely aware that I was expecting it.`
` She was afraid that a careless red truth might end up strangling her own neck...!`
`Because, ...in the first place, a witch was something which should be {i:denied} in red.`
`Believe.`
` Don't doubt!`
` Witches don't exist!`
`{n}Something like that can't exist in this world.`
`They can only exist in the cracks in reality.`
`...They are a fragile existence, curled up in these cracks, frantically trying to protect themselves from the brutal winds of truth,`
` and they can only barely exist like a mirage by surviving on falsehoods and fantasy.`
`In other words, the red, which only witches can use, is the very reality by which they risk denying themselves.`
`......The more they brandish their red words...`
`the more they begin to lose, bit by bit, that crack in reality inside which they can endure.`
`That is why they don't want, through the red,`
` ......to carelessly lose that crack in reality which is based on fuzzy information, or in other words, fantasy.`
`Because they understand that they would be gradually cornering themselves.`
`Of course, she would never admit it.`
`Because, if she did,`
` it would be the same as admitting that she is something that can't exist in this world, like an imaginary number.`
`Don't be afraid.`
` Stay strong...!`
`{n}She knows this deep down, and better than anyone.`
`That her red treasured sword can't easily be used without considerable resolve...!`
`"...What's wrong.`
` I'll say it again.`
` ......Repetition requested!"`
`"‘There are at least 19 people on this island’!"`
`"........................`
` ......Hmh.`
` ...I decline."`
`At the end of a long, long time spent deliberating,`
` ......letting a single deep breath escape, she quietly proclaimed her refusal.`
`......I had thought that she'd use it.`
`But Beato refused to speak in red, even though it would cost her victory in the opening part of the game.`
`"You declined, yes......?`
` Which means that, from now on,`
` I can create as many fictional character Xs outside of the 18 as I want...?"`
`"Do as you wish.`
` ...I have declined your repetition.`
` Isn't that enough for now?`
` ......The reason I declined was...`
`......`
` ...No, I will not reveal that for now.`
` You will know soon in any case."`
`"...Ihihi.`
` Still acting tough, I see..."`
`"......Red that I deliberately don't use is in itself a fitting use of red.`
` You called it my red treasured sword.`
` A pleasant analogy.`
` I will use it too.`
` ......A treasured sword is at its best when it is sheathed.`
` In fact, there are times it can instill even more fear because it is sheathed."`
`"That's right.`
` ...As I fight, I always have to keep in mind when you might turn everything over with those red words.`
` It's some pretty serious pressure."`
`"......And there are times when having a repetition declined makes things harder for me.`
` ...Those times, I can't tell whether you can't repeat because my guess was right,`
` or whether you're just misleading me and letting me think whatever I want."`
`"...In that sense, yes, I see.`
` A sheathed treasured sword."`
`"............What does it matter?`
` If I'm going to push you off a cliff anyway, I might as well let you climb a little higher first.`
` ...We have still barely begun.`
` Much is left to come..."`
`"I'll resign from this challenge.`
` ...Go and get drunk on your faint victory for now.`
` ......Only for now."`
`That bitter comment did, in fact, appear to have marked the end of the game's opening battle.`
` Even so, I couldn't relax my guard at all.`
`...I was unable to relax my feeling of tension until I was greeted by the sound of Ronove's applause...`
`"......Spectacular, Battler‐sama.`
` I suppose we could say that this game has started with at least the opening unfolding to your advantage?"`
`"No idea...`
` I still don't know whether this piece was something I tore from her with my own hands,`
` or whether she guided me into taking it."`
`"......After all, knowing you...`
`you probably know that I'm being led into a trap, and that clapping is just a barefaced lie, right...?"`
`"How could you think that?`
` I am innocently celebrating your ability that has enabled you to take one shot at Milady, though granted it is only the opening.`
` ...After all, Milady is a person who is quick to become arrogant.`
` I believe that a little stimulation such as that makes for a good medicine every once in a while."`
`"...This butler of yours sure has a vicious tongue..."`
`"Isn't that so?`
` Sometimes he enrages even me."`
`"My, my, how incredibly rude of me."`
`"Well then, Milady, Battler‐sama.`
` Would you care for some more black tea?`
` The game has still barely begun.`
` Please leave any tea or pastries that might adorn this game to me.`
` Please, do not hesitate to advance further in the game."`
`"I will.`
` Let's move forward.`
` Now is when it really starts."`
`"............Hmph.`
` Very well.`
` Let us advance the clock.`
` Ronove, black tea, please."`
`"Certainly.`
` What about a cookie?"`
`"No need.`
` Give it to Beelzebub to keep her happy.`
` ............Remain silent for now."`
`While listening to the sound of the demon butler pouring tea, the witch closed her eyes slightly and fell into silence.`
`......For some time, she was deeply lost in thought, but eventually a roguish glint came into her eyes.`
`"Very well.`
` ............Why don't I inform you now why I declined to speak in red for the first move."`
`"......What...?`
` Bring it on.`
` Show me what you've got."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...`
` It really is a big piece that you'd hate to miss."`
`"......It may be hasty, but allow me to move.`
` I won't use red, but from here on, Rosa will explain on my behalf.`
` Listen."`
`"Of course, I agree as well.`
` You too, right, Rosa?`
` ...............Rosa?"`
`"Huh, ah, sorry...`
` M‐me too.`
` I agree."`
`".........What's wrong, Rosa‐san.`
` ...You've been really quiet for a while now.`
` Are you feelin' sick...?"`
`From the beginning, Rosa had never been one to willingly cut in on the siblings' fights.`
`...But even so, she seemed unmotivated,`
` and had said almost nothing at all during this night's conference.`
`The whole time, she had been hanging her head, and appeared to be thinking of something else...`
`"You've been in a daze for a while now.`
` Do you think you can protect the inheritance like that?`
` You are also the mother of your child, so get a stronger hold on yourself."`
`"I, I'm sorry......"`
`"I imagine you woke up quite early this morning?`
` If you feel sick, you shouldn't overdo it."`
`"......The beds have been prepared in the guest rooms.`
` How about taking a rest?`
` I will guide you."`
`"No, ...I'm fine.`
` Thank you."`
`"...What is it?`
` Is there something you're worrying about?"`
`".........No, not really........."`
`"Are you sure...?`
` It feels like your mind has been elsewhere this whole time.`
` ...I wonder if that has anything to do with what we've been talking about...?"`
`At those words, everyone stared at Rosa together.`
`As if in response, Rosa's shoulders quivered.`
`Apparently Kyrie's guess hadn't been wrong.`
`{n}...Nor did Rosa deny it...`
`"..................No, umm...`
` ................................."`
`She swallowed whatever it was she had been about to say, and went silent again.`
`By now, even the other siblings were also beginning to realize that something about her demeanor was different from usual...`
`"What is it?`
` ...You've been weird for a while.`
` Do you have something on your mind...?"`
`"All of us've just sworn to remain united, haven't we?`
` Don't be all unfriendly now, worryin' by yourself.`
` Let's talk it over."`
`"......Rosa.`
` Tell us."`
`Pressed by the men one after the other, Rosa made up her mind, and nervously began to open up...`
`It was almost...`
`as though she was trying to confess to some modest prank which had inadvertently brought about a serious situation...`
`such was the atmosphere in the room.`
`"No, umm......`
` ......Th‐this mistress of Grandfather's, this {f:5:Beatrice},`
` ......is she really, um,`
` .........still alive, I was wondering..."`
`"Huh?`
` Obviously she's alive.`
` She's sending letters to us, what more do you want?"`
`"Whether she's healthy or not is a different story though.`
` The lovely woman in that portrait must be getting up there in age by now."`
`"I'd think she's healthy.`
` People who are crafty when it comes to money are healthy no matter how old they are!`
` Evil plans might even be the best rejuvenating agent.`
` Wahahaha."`
`"......She can't be...`
`......alive."`
`"Huh?`
` ......What did you just say?"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice} is...`
`...dead...`
` .........I,`
` ...I killed her...!"`
`"Wh‐......what did you say......?!"`
`"...Wh‐...what do you mean, Rosa...?!"`
`"B‐but, it's not like I was the one who kill—`
` ......But, but I was the one that brought her to a place like that!`
` ...I really did kill her...`
` I tried to make myself believe it was a dream!!"`
`"......But......it really wasn't after all!`
` Which means this is......a letter from {f:5:Beatrice}'s ghost!!`
` Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`It was so sudden that everyone was lost for words.`
` Rosa kept on talking, unable to stop, holding her head as her hair flew all about...`
`"Please, calm yourself...!`
` Rosa‐san...!"`
`"I, I have absolutely no clue what's goin' on...!`
` Already dead?`
` What do you mean...?!"`
`"......I think it means two things.`
` First, ...its literal meaning.`
` ...And second, it substantiates that our earlier guess was correct."`
`"Which means......`
` .........Rosa, ......you have met with {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"I, I've never heard Rosa speak about that once.`
` ...Rosa, when was it?`
` When could you possibly have met {f:5:Beatrice}?!"`
`"Long ago!`
` Long, long, long ago!!`
` We had just moved over to the island and I was young!!`
` It wasn't my fault, it's not like {i:I} killed her...!!`
` Uuuuuuuuughhhuuu!!"`
`"...Calm down!`
` Nobody's blaming you for anything, alright?`
` First, drink some water.`
` Okay?`
` Natsuhi‐san, the pitcher, please."`
`"Y‐yes.`
` .........Here you go, Rosa‐san.`
` Please, calm yourself......"`
`".........................................."`
`Until Rosa was able to regain her calm amidst her ragged breathing, ......no one was able to speak a word...`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I have been calling to you for a while.`
` Did you not hear me...?"`
`"......Hmm.`
` Were you?`
` My apologies.`
` I was lost in my thoughts.`
` Forgive me."`
`"The weather is pleasant.`
` ...I see, I can understand how the weather has stolen your heart.`
` Will you drink your black tea here...?"`
`"...............Who...am I?"`
`".................................`
` ......I will bring some black tea now.`
` Wait here for a while."`
`"Forget about the black tea.`
` Talk with me."`
`"......Very well."`
`Kinzo had used the excuse of going to bring some black tea to try and interrupt the conversation for the time being.`
` ...But his attempt had been very transparent.`
`I sat in the garden chair, and beckoned Kinzo to do the same.`
`{n}Kinzo sat down heavily, exaggerating his age.`
`For a while, we sat, appreciating the silence...`
`"......Who am I?`
` To this day, no one has answered me this question.`
` ......For some reason, everyone averts their gaze and evades me."`
`"........................"`
`"......I have known you for a long time.`
` I think of you as my best friend, even as a father.`
` ......That is why I want so much for you to tell me.`
` You must know.`
` ...Who I am."`
`"..................`
` ............Why do you worry about something like that?`
` You are {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` The master of this mansion, is that not so?`
` ......What more could you want to know?"`
`"............I do not know."`
`"What's this?`
` ......Don't you even understand yourself what it is you want to know?`
` That is baffling.`
` In my younger days, I sometimes found myself wanting to play in the maze of thought that has no exit.`
` Maybe that is what your worries are..."`
`Kinzo laughed as though it was a trivial matter.`
` ...However, I couldn't help but feel that this behavior was nothing but another attempt to force me to stop my further questioning.`
`"...........................`
` ...Hmph.`
` ......So not even you will tell me that...after all."`
`"There is nothing to tell.`
` You are {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Isn't that more than enough?"`
`"......No, that's not it.`
` ............What I wish to know is not my name.`
` It is...`
`who...`
`I am."`
`"......Who am I, what am I?`
` ...How long have I been here, ...and how long will I continue my days here?"`
`"........................`
` ...I really should bring some black tea.`
` Do you not think it a waste of all this fine weather?"`
`"................................."`
`".........What is this all about...?`
` Somehow, it looks like the story of your past, right?"`
`"It appears so.`
` ...To think that we would go this far back..."`
`"Wondering who you were...`
` ...It looks like you had some pretty high‐minded worries."`
`"......That is to be expected.`
` At the time, I was unable to understand who I was,`
` or why I was alive."`
`"Well, in puberty,`
` everyone is captured by those philosophical worries, wondering what meaning there is to their life, at least once.`
` Doesn't this just mean that you had this kind of charming period once in your life?"`
`".....................`
` ...I had been in that mansion since the time I was born.`
` And I lived only inside the mansion.`
` Of course, I was able to go out into the garden, but the area around the mansion was surrounded by a very tall fence, which I was unable to leave through,`
` and I would be told severely that I mustn't leave."`
`"......I could walk freely throughout the mansion and the garden,`
` but my desire to take just one step outside those of my own accord was never granted."`
`"...............What do you mean by that?`
` ...Are you trying to say that, for as long as you can remember, you were always a bird in a cage?"`
`"......I thought that was just how things were.`
` After all, I had been living like that as far back as I could remember.`
` I didn't even think to question it."`
`"What in the world............are you?"`
`"That's it.`
` That is what I also hoped to know."`
`"............Heh.`
` I'm sure you'll say something like "I wasn't a human, I was a witch", right?"`
`"No, that's not correct.`
` Not {i:yet} correct.`
` ......Or, should I say, it was {i:once} correct.`
` ......I was constructed by Kinzo, a human built by a human.`
` ...No, maybe I should call it a cage made of flesh."`
`"What's that supposed to mean...?`
` ...This is starting to sound weird."`
`"......You probably won't believe it anyway.`
` Listen first.`
` .........I was a great witch who had lived for one thousand years.`
` But at some time, I was summoned by Kinzo,`
` ...and by his hidden arts, I was bound as his prisoner for eternity."`
`"............Never heard that before.`
` From what we hear in the Ushiromiya family, you were summoned by Grandfather,`
` made something like a devil's contract with him, and gave him the gold."`
`"Yes.`
` That is correct.`
` ...Then I was supposed to hide myself until the contract was over.`
` But, .........well, it's tough being a popular woman.`
` .........By some turn of events, Kinzo fell in love with me."`
`"...Grandfather's nearsightedness must have gotten pretty bad.`
` With astigmatism too, ihihi.`
` To fall in love with you, of all things."`
`".........Hmph.`
` Well, to me it was supremely annoying."`
`"...However, the power of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s is a frightening thing.`
` He exhibited fearsome power and rooted me to this place.`
` ...He said I wouldn't be freed until I nodded my head in agreement.`
` ...Such an overbearing man."`
`"Isn't that awesome.`
` Everyone knows Grandfather's obsessed with the occult, but...`
`...who knew he had the power to root down the Great Witch {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"......Heh, ridiculous.`
` You think I'd believe such a weird story?"`
`"...As I thought, you don't believe."`
`"All I believe is the fact that you lived in this hidden mansion in the middle of the forest.`
` You are the 19th person on Rokkenjima, right?!"`
`"......Indeed.`
` Just as you imagine, this is deep in the forest of Rokkenjima.`
` A hidden mansion not to be found from the outside world.`
` Its name is {ruby:Nine Birds' Retreat:Kuwadorian}."`
`"......Come to think of it, I heard that the guesthouse's real name was {ruby:Visitor's Retreat:Toraian}.`
` ...I see, the naming sense is similar.`
` ......So, you were Grandfather's lover, who lived here in secret.`
` Isn't that right?!"`
`"Lover isn't the right way to say it.`
` ......You should probably call it Kinzo's unrequited love.`
` I spoke of it just recently, correct?`
` He fell in love with me of his own accord.`
` He then courted me, but I rejected him."`
`"......Then, I was shut up in this hidden mansion.`
` .........No, I shouldn't say that I was shut up in the mansion.`
` ......It would be more correct to say that I was shut up in this body."`
`"............I have no idea what you just said at the end there."`
`"You will just make fun of it and not listen, right?`
` After all, you say that you don't believe in witches or magic.`
` If you have no ears to hear what I tell you,`
` saying it would be the pinnacle of foolishness."`
`"...........................`
` ......I'll decide whether I believe or not.`
` ...After all, if I don't hear it, the story won't move on.`
` Tell me.`
` ...The story of your past."`
`"Alright.`
` .........I refused Kinzo when he courted me, but he was not a man to lose heart just because of that.`
` He wanted to get my consent no matter what.`
` He shut me up in this mansion, and spent an eternity trying to win my heart."`
`"...He really is overbearing.`
` No one likes a man who can't take a hint, right?"`
`".........*cackle*cackle*.`
` Regardless of whether I responded to his courting or not,`
` to make a man so desperate for me was...well, as a woman, it wasn't unpleasant."`
`"......However, I never nodded my head.`
` I tried what I could to escape his restrictions,`
` but that barrier was firm, and I couldn't break it."`
`"......And then?"`
`"After trying to resist in various ways,`
` I eventually reached the conclusion that, to escape from Kinzo's barrier, I would have to throw away my body of flesh.`
` ......The physical body is a vessel which carries many restrictions in terms of magic."`
`"Throw away your body of flesh......?`
` What's that?`
` Something like an out‐of‐body experience?"`
`"Well, if you want to think of it that way.`
` However, I am not a spirit.`
` Even though I am a witch, in the beginning, I was born with a human's body of flesh.`
` So for me, throwing away that physical body,`
` while it didn't mean the same thing as death, did require a corresponding level of resolve."`
`"So in other words,`
` ......you made up your mind that you couldn't be released except by suicide, is that what you mean?"`
`"It wasn't suicide.`
` It was nothing more than throwing away my body of flesh.`
` ......Of course, becoming nothing more than soul is a precarious situation.`
` When the soul leaves its body of flesh, it is constantly exposed to the strong winds of the sun.`
` It was not easy even for me to maintain myself and avoid being scattered by them."`
`"It was a final measure that I wanted to avoid if I could.`
` However, there was no other way to break through Kinzo's barrier."`
`"......*cackle*, after all, I am a free spirit.`
` I couldn't stand being kept in a cage until Kinzo's life was over."`
`I couldn't understand this story Beato kept going on about, about throwing away her body of flesh,`
` as anything more than suicide.`
`Grandfather persistently courted her, and to escape from that,`
` ......she chose her own death...?`
`"...............So you're saying you committed suicide?`
` What are you saying?`
` Isn't that you, sitting carefree there in the garden chair?"`
`"......That's right.`
` That is the new cage I was given by Kinzo."`
`"............Cage?`
` You mean this mansion?"`
`"No.`
` I mean my body, relaxing in the garden chair over there.`
` .........After I became a soul and tried to escape,`
` even then, Kinzo had no intention of allowing me to escape."`
`"...Yes, indeed, he is a frightening person.`
` Normally, seeing the woman of your one‐sided desires take her own life should be enough to bring anyone to their senses, even if their love was a hundred years old.`
` ......I suppose it makes him somewhat of a mage after all.`
` ......*cackle*."`
`"Don't try to speak in riddles with that incomprehensible witch‐girl talk.`
` ...In short, what are you trying to say?"`
`"That Kinzo didn't let me escape even after I became a soul.`
` ......Human emotions are terrifying.`
` That he would be able to exhibit this much power..."`
`"Tying down a spirit of the dead...`
`is not a level readily attained, even for a mage seeking that as his specialty.`
` Because I knew that, Kinzo's fearful magical power shocked me then for the first time."`
`"............Then Kinzo seized my soul and brought me back.`
` However, a cage to hold a seized soul cannot be made, not from iron nor from lead.`
` ......There is but one exception."`
`"............What?`
` You aren't going to say it was a magical cage or something, are you?"`
`"Wrong.`
` That body of flesh over there, just like yours or mine.`
` ...Only a cage made of flesh and blood can tie a spirit down to this world.`
` ......Kinzo shut my soul up once more into a cage of flesh built to be exactly like me."`
`".....................`
` ...So in summary, is it something like this?`
` Grandfather persistently courted you, you started to hate it, and you committed suicide,`
` but you weren't clever enough to finish the job?`
` ...Damn, you really took a roundabout way to say something like that."`
`"No, that's wrong.`
` My soul was shut up in the seed of a homunculus,`
` and I was born out of a test tube."`
`"Huh?!`
` Ridiculous...!`
` That's goddamn impossible and you know it!"`
`"Kinzo accomplished even the miracle of creating life.`
` And only to shut my soul up in that cage.`
` ......That he would show such magical power simply because of his own love...`
` A thoroughly terrifying person."`
`"Aah, okay, it's really gotten to the point of ridiculousness now!`
` Say whatever you want.`
` I won't believe a word of it.`
` Just do what you like, for hell's sake."`
`"...............mh.`
` ...What is this unpleasant attitude?"`
`"Heh,`
` in the beginning, I showed a little interest, thinking there might be some huge hint hidden,`
` but the more I hear, the weirder this story starts to get.`
` This is supposed to be a game about denying witches,`
` but I get the feeling that I'm suddenly being made to just swallow a witch story."`
`"Sorry, but I don't feel like listening to this any more.`
` Just keep rambling on to yourself as much as you want.`
` I'll just be here digging out some earwax or something."`
`".....................`
` ......Hmph."`
`When I started showing a cold attitude, Beato acted unusually discouraged.`
`Of course, her expression was still brazen...`
`but I had the feeling that I was able to catch a glimpse of loneliness because I hadn't found the story of her past interesting,`
` in that really easy to understand expression of hers.`
`......For some reason, that slight reaction made her seem pitiful,`
` so even though I kept my couldn't‐care‐less attitude, I decided to humor her slightly.`
`Damn it, even though she's an irritating witch, I'm still weak against her because her chromosomes are XX...`
`"......Well, I have absolutely no desire to believe you, but,`
` ............keep going.`
` I'll listen to your story in place of cookies."`
`"So you treat the story of my past like cookies.`
` ......You think that if you abuse me like that, I will just casually tell you...?"`
`After I made fun of her, Beato reacted a little sensitively.`
`It looked like, even though making fun of people was her specialty, she was horrible at being made fun of by other people.`
`Just then, my cup of black tea suddenly made a sound, surprising me.`
`"......Milady's soul was seized and breathed into a cage of new life.`
` In other words, Milady received life as a human once more."`
`Before I had realized it, the demon butler had appeared and taken my cup, and was adding more black tea to it.`
`"Ronove.`
` That is enough of that story.`
` He says that it is too ridiculous to listen to.`
` I now also feel ridiculous and have no intention of speaking."`
`"Some new cookies are currently being baked.`
` I thought that, until then, the story of Milady's past would be a perfect substitute.`
` Pu ku ku...!"`
`"I, ...I already said that I've had enough of talking about me!`
` You are both unpleasant people.`
` I'm leaving!`
` Ronove, leave as soon as you are done serving.`
` No idle talking with Battler."`
`"Certainly.`
` I will make an effort."`
`Beato's confusing female short temper took hold of her, and she turned her body into gold butterflies, scattered, and disappeared.`
`After that, only Ronove and the scent of the black tea were left...`
`"......I feel kind of bad for making her angry."`
`"It appears that you are aware of it, so there is nothing more to be said."`
`"Wait a second.`
` Weren't you the one that pushed her over the edge?"`
`"Pu ku ku ku.`
` My, whatever could you mean?`
` Would you care for some sugar and milk?"`
`"...Just milk will be fine.`
` ............And I also want some cookies."`
`".........You are aware that baking the cookies will take some more time?"`
`"There's a substitute, you said?"`
`"......Certainly.`
` If you would listen quietly, I will continue the story."`
`"She said something about a homunculus.`
` ...I know a bit about that.`
` It's that thing, right?`
` A manufactured human created with alchemy or something?"`
`"Yes.`
` Milady's soul was shut up in a homunculus, and she was revived into this world, receiving life again as a baby.`
` ......However, because she was a baby,`
` even if Kinzo tried to profess his love to her, it would be useless."`
`"........................`
` .........You aren't saying...`
`......Grandfather shut that baby up in this hidden mansion,`
` until it grew to reach the same age?!"`
`"Yes.`
` That is what I am saying.`
` However, while her soul was the same, a human spirit receives a strong influence from its vessel.`
` Milady lost all of her memories of the past, and grew up as a very normal human girl."`
`"And you're saying......that's the Beato sitting in the garden chair?"`
`"Yes.`
` That is correct.`
` She grew to be completely identical.`
` However, she did not possess her power as a witch.`
` ......I must stress that Milady was a human."`
`"................................."`
`Beato, who was sitting in the garden chair, looking up at the sky, asked that same question again.`
`She asked who she was.`
`...The meaning of those words was finally starting to click.`
` She couldn't understand why she was living here, all locked up.`
`Grandfather had seized {f:5:Beatrice}'s soul, shut it up in a body of flesh,`
` and then shut that up in a hidden mansion.`
`However, since she had lived here since the time she was born, she couldn't even understand who she was,`
` or why she lived shut up in there...`
`......W‐...wait, wait.`
`{n}Who would take such a stupid story seriously?`
`Why don't I change my interpretation?`
`{n}...Essentially, couldn't it be something like this?`
`Grandfather met {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}He then fell in love with her and courted her, but she didn't nod her head in agreement.`
`{n}And so he got angry, and shut her up inside this hidden mansion.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} tried to escape, but no matter what she did, she couldn't succeed,`
` ......so she finally chose her own death.`
`......And then, .........hmm.`
`...Maybe there was a girl that looked just like {f:5:Beatrice}, ...no, a baby.`
`And Grandfather raised this child with care.`
`But maybe Grandfather didn't view this child as his daughter.`
`"Shut my soul up once more into a cage of flesh".`
`Those words probably meant...`
`...that he didn't view this kid as her child, but as her reincarnation.`
` Maybe that's what it meant.`
`If you interpret it that way, even a story that weird might make a little sense...`
`...No no no.`
` This might be some bullshit Beato cooked up to confuse me.`
`As if I could accept any of this...!`
`{n}In the first place, ...Kuwadorian, was it?`
`{n}There's no proof whatsoever that a hidden mansion actually existed.`
`Couldn't this be something she just fabricated on the spot?`
`"`
`{p:1:A hidden mansion called Kuwadorian does exist in the forest of Rokkenjima}.`
` That is the place we were just talking about."`
`".........Huh?`
` R‐...red?!"`
`Ronove used the red to say that Kuwadorian actually existed.`
`...Did that mean the same thing as the red Beato used?`
`"Even if I am not much of one, I am a demon all the same.`
` ...Please keep this a secret from Milady, yes?"`
`"...Y‐......yeah!"`
`Beato, who knew I would try to trip her up, had grown extremely cautious when using red.`
`To think that Ronove could also use that red...`
`Of course, it's the red of a crafty man.`
` I don't know how far I can accept it,`
` but anyway, I might be able to get some hint out of it......`
`"So that Beato relaxing in the garden of Kuwadorian, ...and that conversation she had with Grandfather, were the truth?"`
`"Yes.`
` It is the truth.`
` In the past,`
` {p:1:the pair actually had a conversation like that in this place}."`
`"Th‐thanks a lot.`
` I'll ask for some more red.`
` She said that she was born from a homunculus,`
` but does that kind of unscientific, magical thing actually exist?!"`
`"I am unable to answer that question.`
` The reason is that it would cause a stalemate."`
`"......A stalemate??`
` What do you mean?"`
`"It's a chess term referring to a state in which, similar to a "perpetual check",`
` any further progress in a game becomes impossible.`
` This is the opposite of an endless repetition of moves,`
` and refers to a situation in which all moves disappear, resulting in a kind of deadlock."`
`"In chess this would lead to a draw, just as if there were a perpetual check.`
` ...However, there is no draw in the game between you and Milady.`
` Therefore, I am unable to answer in red any question that would bring about a stalemate."`
`".........You're speaking in riddles by saying something I don't really understand,`
` but when it comes down to it, you're just trying to trick me because you can't say in red that something magical like a homunculus exists, right?"`
`"If I were to say in red that "witches exist", what would you do, Battler‐sama?"`
`"...............mh.`
` ......That's what we're having this big fight over whether or not to believe, right?`
` If you told me that outright, there'd be nothing more to discuss.`
` It'd be game over."`
`"If I said "witches exist" in red, you would have no room for argument.`
` However, since the reason would never have been made clear to you, Battler‐sama, you probably wouldn't accept it.`
` However, after being told that in red, you would have no room for argument and would not have been shown any proof."`
`"In this situation, Battler‐sama,`
` even though you wouldn't be able to admit defeat, you would have no way to make a counterargument, and it would become a deadlock.`
` Even though checkmate would not have been reached, no more moves would exist."`
`"Since you would not be able to make your next move, it would never become Milady's turn,`
` and the game would stop there for all eternity.`
` As a result, Milady would be unable to force you to submit.`
` ......That would be a deadlock situation."`
`"In order to avoid that,`
` I am unable to answer questions of this form in red."`
`"......So, to cut to the chase, you mean that questions that leave no room for discussion are prohibited?`
` Well, that makes sense, I guess.`
` If I was told "witches exist" in red, I'd have to give up from the start."`
`"I am pleased that you understand.`
` I believe we might be able to work together if you ask a question of a different form."`
`"......Can you respond to the repetition request she dodged?`
` About the number of people on this island."`
`"If Milady held back on the request, then of course I cannot respond.`
` As Milady's furniture, I am unable to act too forward."`
`Ronove made an exaggerated gesture, trying to act like a loyal retainer.`
` This guy's so shameless.`
`"Tch.`
` Just when I thought you might be useful."`
`"......I'll give up on that and search for a different question.`
` ...That's right.`
` I was forgetting to check something important.`
` .........This is a story about Beato's memories, right?`
` When did it happen?`
` It couldn't be happening right now, right?"`
`"Correct.`
` {p:1:This is the world of 1967}.`
` It is the world of 19 years ago."`
`"............Hmmmmm..."`
`Let's go through the story one more time.`
`{n}I wonder if it couldn't be something like this.`
`Grandfather had a person with whom he fell in unrequited love, called {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}And he confined her in this hidden mansion and continually courted her.`
`{n}But she was stubborn and didn't say yes.`
`Eventually, she grew pessimistic about being unable to escape from here...`
`and probably, committed suicide.`
`......And then,`
` ......her soul was put in a homunculus and......`
`No, no, if I accept that, it's the same as accepting the witch.`
`I can interpret that part like this.`
`{n}She probably......left a daughter behind when she died.`
`That talk about the soul being put in a new body...probably meant...`
`that Grandfather raised that child believing it to be the reincarnation of {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`...In that case, Beato must have existed on this island for at least the last 19 years as the 19th person, and then...`
`...umm......`
`"......I'm starting to get confused.`
` ...In any event, none of this leaves the realm of guesswork.`
` The only thing that I can definitely say in red,`
` is that in 1967, in a hidden mansion on Rokkenjima, {f:5:Beatrice} existed as a human.`
` That's all."`
`"That is correct.`
` {p:1:In 1967, in a hidden mansion on Rokkenjima, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama existed as a human}."`
`"Oh, thank you.`
` That really helps."`
`"Congratulations.`
` With this, you have made clear the existence of the piece known as the 19th person.`
` The 19th human outside of the 18 who you can blame, just as you longed for."`
`"......A sacrificial sheep that you can shift the blame of any crime onto.`
` And you must be so glad that it is Milady.`
` Pu ku ku ku."`
`Ronove laughed indiscreetly.`
`Somehow, I didn't like his phrasing, so I didn't feel like laughing along with him.`
`"......That's right.`
` Auntie Rosa said it.`
` ......‘{f:5:Beatrice} is dead’?`
` "I killed her"?`
` What does that mean...?"`
`"As for that, it may be faster to see the actual circumstances rather than listen to me tell you.`
` Let us advance the clock a little more."`
`Ronove pulled a stylish pocket watch from his pocket, and made to wind the crown.`
`As soon as he did, I saw gold butterflies gather behind Ronove's back and take the form of a person.`
`...Was it Beato?!`
` I quickly realized that it was someone else.`
`It was her.`
` That oldest sister of the Seven Stakes, who loved tormenting me more than anything else.`
`......If I don't think myself lucky to see that sexy ass, I won't be able to play along with their torture game...`
`"Ronove‐sama.`
` So, you were still here.`
` This is an urgent call from {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"My, my,`
` what kind of urgent business could it be?`
` ......It appears as though I have spent slightly too long chatting with you, Battler‐sama.`
` Well then, Battler‐sama, if you will excuse me.`
` Please continue to enjoy your game with Milady."`
`"Yeah, yeah.`
` I'll enjoy it as best as I can.`
` ...'Cause the conversations are more lively with you than with Beato.`
` And you use the red more graciously.`
` Come talk again any time."`
`"............Battler‐sama.`
` Despite how I look, I am Milady's furniture.`
` ...I cannot do something that Milady does not wish.`
` What I said in red was something that normally should have come from Milady's mouth.`
` ...I did nothing more than announce the red truth in Milady's place as she sulked."`
`"So she really was sulking then?`
` Ihihihi!"`
`"Pu ku kuku."`
`Seeing me and Ronove incomprehensibly hitting it off, that Seven Stakes chick cocked her head slightly.`
`"Ronove‐sama.`
` We are keeping {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama waiting.`
` Let us hurry."`
`"Yes, I will come immediately.`
` Well then, Battler‐sama, I shall see you later.`
` ......It appears that we have finally started getting along.`
` As I thought, I have the feeling that we can become good friends."`
`"If by that you mean partners at gossiping behind Beato's back."`
`"Ronove‐sama!"`
`"Yes, yes.`
` Then, if you will excuse me."`
`Maybe it was because she really didn't like seeing him act friendly with me, or maybe it was because she had really been told to hurry.`
`The Seven Stakes babe bellowed sharply at Ronove, and he laughed foolishly and disappeared, as if running away...`
`"......Hmph.`
` How could I, the eldest sister of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, be called on for this level of work!`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama could easily have told one of the younger sisters, who look like they have so much free time, for something like this. Sheesh...!"`
`"Why so grumpy, girl?`
` If you're hungry, eat a cookie or something.`
` Why don't I give you the last one?`
` Ihihi!"`
`"......Hummmmm?`
` How thoughtful.`
` Then, shall I take one?"`
`I lightly pushed the snack plate with the last remaining cookie on it over to her.`
`"Thank you"`
`As though coming as a replacement for the period at the end of the sentence, a sharp sound pierced the table...`
`The nails on three of her fingers had sharply extended, and were stuck...`
`a hair's breadth into the gaps between my fingers on the hand I had used to push the plate.`
`......It had happened in an instant, ...so for a while, I didn't even realize that her fingernails had grown.`
`The tips of those sharp nails were like blades with a red manicure.`
`......The spaces between the bases of my fingers prickled.`
`......Those razor‐like blades were sticking sharply into the back of my hand, and into the spaces between my fingers...`
`By those three blades, my carelessly outstretched right hand was not even permitted to shake, and all I could do now was allow a single line of cold sweat to drip down.`
`"............Wowee.`
` ...Isn't it about time you cut your nails, babe?"`
`"Lucifer.`
` ......That is my noble name.`
` Honored furniture serving {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, and the eldest sister of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory."`
`".........I'm not like my disgraceful and cretinous younger sisters.`
` If you don't show the proper respect, you will regret it."`
`"...How would I regret it?`
` I don't have a clue."`
`".........Heheheheheh.`
` Stupid kid.`
` ...Do you really want me to play with you that much?`
` You really can't get me out of your mind?"`
`"I'll thrust my stake deep, deep into you and make you really enjoy being gouged, got it......?`
` Hehehe{0}he{0}heh{0}heheh{0}he{0}hehehhh......!"`
`".........You bitch.`
` One day I'll push you down and say that back to you."`
`"Oh, really?`
` I'll be looking forward to that, then?`
` Ehhehe{0}heh{0}heheheh......`
` ...Ahhahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!!"`
`Rosa eventually regained her calm.`
`The men wanted to hurry her into talking faster, but Kyrie intervened.`
`...If something like she had just mentioned really had happened, ......it was an abominable past that she wouldn't want to remember.`
`After taking several deep breaths with her hand over her chest, it seemed that she had more or less gathered the resolve to talk...`
`"......How old was I then, I wonder...`
` ...Probably...middle school, or... ...I don't remember well.`
` Anyway, I think I was about that old..."`
`"Which means... Maybe about twenty years ago?"`
`"Back then, my grades weren't very good, and Mother was always angry at me.`
` ......I was trying to do my best in my own way,`
` but I couldn't respond to Mother's expectations at all..."`
`"......Mother was always very strict with Rosa.`
` I sympathized with her at the time."`
`"Hmm.`
` You say that even though you were always talking behind her back."`
`"Would you give it a rest, Eva.`
` So?`
` Where did you meet {f:5:Beatrice}, Rosa‐san?!"`
`"Hideyoshi‐san, you mustn't rush her now.`
` ......It's alright, Rosa‐san.`
` Tell us at your leisure."`
`".........Thank you.`
` ...It was a day when I had been scolded particularly harshly by Mother."`
`Even though my tutor had promised to keep it a secret,`
` ...apparently, they told Mother all about how I had complained.`
`Mother scolded me horribly, saying that I was a disgrace to the Ushiromiya family.`
`......Of course, I was doing the best I could.`
`But I had none of Krauss nii‐san's dignity,`
` I couldn't get excellent grades like Eva nee‐san,`
` and I had no leadership like Rudolf nii‐san.`
`...I never stood out, didn't particularly excel at anything,`
` and I almost wanted to ask myself why I had even been born into the Ushiromiya family.`
`I didn't know why I had been born.`
`{n}...On that day, I had the experience of my mind going blank for the first time......`
`For the first time since I was born,`
` ...I realized that in addition to facing or surrendering to my problems,`
` I had the third choice of running away.`
`Even though I say run away, there was no way I could have left Rokkenjima and gone somewhere else.`
`But, anyway, I wanted to run away from the mansion and the way I was at the time.`
`......In a way, it was like running away from home, or maybe a half‐hearted suicide...`
`"......I wanted to disappear.`
` Or maybe it was that child‐like form of resistance where I tried to make my parents worry by disappearing..."`
`".........I thought childishly that if I went into the center of the forest, I could escape from the Ushiromiya house,`
` or maybe I could get back at them by getting lost and making them worry."`
`"So then, ......you went into the forest that you'd been told not to go into?"`
`"......Yes.`
` After reaching the beach, I followed alongside the ocean.`
` ......I didn't have any particular reason,`
` ......but I felt that, if I went around to the opposite side of the island, there might be a place there that no one knew about,`
` which might become a hidden house just for me."`
`"Starting by the beach, it'd be impossible to go all the way around.`
` It becomes a cliff partway, right?`
` There's no way you could pass that way."`
`"...Of course.`
` So, I kept going wherever I could, and kept going deeper and deeper in.`
` ......It was a horrible forest without any paths, but that was comforting to me then.`
` ...If I could make it through such a dangerous forest, then it would be that much greater of an escape from the Ushiromiya family,`
` ...which made me feel good."`
`".........How shameful.`
` If you were scolded because of your grades, all you had to do was work harder."`
`"You mustn't say that.`
` Doesn't Rosa have her talent as a designer instead?"`
`Literally this could be taken as him covering for Rosa,`
` but everyone knew that Rosa's company was not making any profits.`
`"Quit it.`
` Now isn't the time for sarcasm.`
` ......And then you arrived there by coincidence...?`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice}'s...`
`hidden mansion."`
`Rosa nodded weakly......`
`"About how far did you walk.`
` Could you show it to us on a map...?`
` Natsuhi‐san, is there a map of this island?"`
`"No, not right here and now..."`
`"That would be impossible.`
` I was just walking randomly.`
` Even if you showed me a map, I wouldn't know.`
` ......And twenty years have passed since then.`
` I probably couldn't reach it again even if I went into the forest..."`
`".........Hmmmmmm..."`
`Several people let out dejected sighs.`
`It was vividly clear that in their haste,`
` they had thought that some hint related to the witch's epitaph, or maybe even the gold itself, might be resting there in that hidden mansion.`
`"The only part of Rokkenjima that got made ready for development is the area around the mansion.`
` ...The rest is completely uncultivated, and it would probably take considerable effort to survey the entire island."`
`"But just knowing that it actually exists is helpful.`
` It would take some money, but if we enlisted an aerial photography company to investigate,`
` or asked the contractors who constructed this mansion about what happened at the time,`
` we could probably find some way to search for it."`
`"Yes.`
` ...There should be more ways to do it now that there isn't a question about whether it exists or not."`
`"......Mmhm.`
` It is probably worth investigating right away."`
`"We will do that investigation together as siblings.`
` We won't let you do it alone, Nii‐san."`
`It wasn't certain that the gold was hidden in that secret mansion,`
` but it seemed that the fireworks between Krauss and Eva had already begun.`
`"Give it a rest for now, you two.`
` ...Rosa, please continue."`
`"..................Yes."`
`Blindly, randomly, I kept running, on and on.`
`Suddenly, it felt like I had come across something like an animal trail.`
`I had no idea how far I'd walked, and I was very tired,`
` so by then, I was just naturally taking the easiest path to walk on.`
`As I did, .........suddenly, right before my eyes, a very, very tall fence appeared.`
`It was a fence wonderfully adorned in a gothic style.`
`For an instant, I spun around, thinking that I might have returned to the original mansion.`
`Of course, there were fences around the mansion to stop us from entering the forest.`
` But this fence was decorated differently, ......and most of all, it was very tall.`
`It probably reached a full two stories up.`
`It was covered with ivy, and created a mysterious, solemn atmosphere...`
`At the time, ......I believed the legend of the witch of the forest, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`I had been told that she was frightening,`
` but some of the servants told me that she would sometimes help you if you respected her.`
`......Since I had started to lose confidence in how my life was going,`
` I believed that the only way I could be saved was by receiving her help.`
`So that's what made me think it.`
` ......I believed that this was the fence of the mansion of {f:5:Beatrice}, the witch of the forest.`
`I thought that if I could meet with {f:5:Beatrice}, she would definitely save me.`
`So I thought I would try to go in.`
`But that fence was very, very tall, and it didn't look like I could go over it.`
`So I decided to walk around it.`
`{n}I thought that if I did, I would eventually reach a gate.`
`But it wasn't that easy.`
` The fence had a length to match its height, and no matter how far I went, I didn't reach a corner.`
`It might have been enclosing a very massive area,`
` ...or maybe it just felt that way because my child's legs made it difficult to walk in the forest.`
`Anyway, because I couldn't find a gate for a while,`
` I started to feel sad, as though the witch had rejected me...`
`As I did, I eventually came upon a large tree, whose twisted root had bent the fence.`
`I might get my clothes dirty, but if I crawled, it looked like I would be able to sneak in...`
`".........And that was the hidden mansion?"`
`"I don't know whether it was the hidden mansion we've been talking about...`
` Still, at the very least, it wasn't a place that we know of."`
`It wasn't as though I came out into a garden as soon as I passed the fence.`
`{n}I had to continue through a lot more uncultivated forest after that.`
`And then......the forest suddenly opened up.`
` And what appeared there was an unbelievably...`
`.........fantastical scene.`
`To think that Rokkenjima, where I had believed no one other than us lived,`
` ...had been hiding such a wonderful mansion...`
`A beautiful flower garden spanned the front of the mansion.`
`{n}It was a flower garden of a completely different design from the rose garden we know so well, and was very lovely.`
`Of course, the mansion was also wonderful.`
`...It was one or two sizes smaller than ours,`
` but it was a very elegant, and yet lovely mansion.`
`Then, ...............I saw her.`
`{n}I saw her sitting in a garden chair, positioned to give a view of the flower garden, wearing an elegant dress.`
`It was that black dress embroidered in gold that we would later know from that portrait.`
`......I hadn't seen an elegant dress like that except in fairy tales and on the stage of musicals.`
`...That a person would be wearing it as their normal clothes... That in itself seemed quite fantastical.`
`That magical scene was enough to make me lose my sense of reality.`
`If someone had told me then that it was a dream,`
` I might have nodded obediently, and waited to wake up in my bed...`
`Since, in my shock, I had forgotten to hide myself, she eventually noticed me.`
`At first, her expression was quite listless,`
` but when she noticed me, her eyes opened very wide.`
`...It was only natural—a guest that she didn't know had suddenly appeared.`
`I automatically bowed my head, feeling that I should greet her and apologize for entering without permission...`
`"............Who are you?`
` A new gardener?"`
`Those were the first words she said to me.`
`{n}...That calmed me down a little bit.`
`{n}Because I realized that she could be talked with.`
`Because I hadn't been turned into a frog just by meeting her eyes, like the terrifying witch in that fairy tale.`
`"......I,`
` ......I'm sorry.`
` ...I shouldn't have entered the garden without permission..."`
`"........................`
` ......Who are you?`
` Name yourself."`
`"I, ...I am Ushiromiya Rosa."`
`"......Ushiromiya.`
` .....................Hoh.`
` ...So you are one of Kinzo's family."`
`"Huh?`
` Ah, ...yes!`
` I'm Kinzo's daughter.`
` G‐good afternoon...!"`
`I was just a little surprised.`
`{n}...After all, Father was a great man feared by everyone.`
`And she had referred to him without using honorifics.`
`{n}So she quickly became frightening.`
`...After all,`
` if she could refer to my fearsome father that way, she must be a witch with incredible power.`
`After staring at me curiously, she beckoned me to come over to her.`
`And I obeyed, although filled with belated trepidation.`
`{n}......After all, I thought I really might be turned into a frog.`
`...And the closer and closer I got, the stronger that fear became.`
`After all, ...I said it several times already, but,`
` ............that woman and her dress and the flower garden and the mansion,`
` ......that entire harmony was so fantastical and beautiful that it seemed separate from reality.`
`It surely wouldn't have surprised me even if she was actually a witch...`
`And I was truly lucky.`
`{n}She didn't turn me into a frog.`
`As I awkwardly stood there stock still, she motioned to an open chair, and urged me to sit down.`
`"Sit.`
` Welcoming and speaking to those who visit this garden for the first time is my only pleasure.`
` .........That said, I have nothing else to find pleasure in."`
`As she said that, she showed an unhappy smile for just an instant.`
`Because I was full of a strange mix of tension and excitement, I rudely asked her a question suddenly.`
`"...Umm,`
` ............are you the witch of the forest,`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice}......?"`
`"Indeed.`
` I am {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"As I thought.`
` {f:5:Beatrice} actually existed..."`
`"...Did she look just like the portrait?"`
`"......Yes.`
` Exactly like the portrait."`
`"So she wasn't just...`
`...a witch from Father's imagination..."`
`"And then, what did you talk with her about?"`
`"...As she prepared some tea, she asked me various things about myself.`
` ......First, she was surprised that I had come through the forest.`
` It seems she believed that many dangerous wolves lived outside the fence."`
`"...So when I told her I had reached this place by going through the forest, she was very surprised.`
` She asked how I had managed to escape from the wolves—did I give them biscuits and they let me go?`
` Or did I cover myself in a magic cloak, or...`
` Those kinds of things, I think."`
`"Wahahaha.`
` ...That sure sounds like a witch.`
` What an interestin' person."`
`"Quiet, honey.`
` ............It was a long time ago,`
` but didn't Father threaten us, saying that wolves lived in the forest, so we shouldn't get close to there?"`
`"Yes, there was a time like that.`
` Ridiculous.`
` Even though Japanese wolves went extinct long ago.`
` What a childish trick."`
`"I don't remember, though...?`
` Did Dad really tell us something like that...?`
` It was the witch of the forest, right?`
` I don't think I've ever heard about wolves."`
`"You were still in elementary school.`
` Don't you remember?"`
`"You actually went and replied that you'd want to try petting the wolves.`
` So Father immediately gave up the wolf story and changed it to the story about the witch.`
` Such obvious lies, ahahahahaha."`
`"Hahahaha.`
` At the time, the witch story had a much more immediate effect on you, Rudolf, than the wolves.`
` I remember it well.`
` Don't you remember those nights when you clung to my back?"`
`"...*giggle*.`
` I see, even Rudolf‐san used to have that cute period."`
`"Oh, put a lid on it.`
` I was just a kid."`
`"......Well, anyway.`
` If Father was the one who shut {f:5:Beatrice} up in there, it makes sense that he would use the same wolf story.`
` To him, the vast forest of Rokkenjima was a wall that shouldn't be crossed,`
` dividing his two incompatible worlds: the Ushiromiya family and his mistress's mansion."`
`"If you think about the height of that fence, it does seem that Father had turned the whole area, garden and all, into a giant jail cell.`
` ......Just like a national border dividing his two separate worlds."`
`"...Forget the wolves, were there any kinds of stray dogs there at the time?`
` It could have been a fence to protect against those."`
`"There are no wolves or stray dogs on Rokkenjima.`
` Just as Nii‐san and Kyrie‐san are saying,`
` that fence was probably a border between us and {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"However, if she innocently believed the story about the wolves, that's pretty...naive.`
` That's nothin' like the way I'd imagine a witch."`
`"......That's right.`
` I also sensed that.`
` ...She was very pompous, just like my image of a witch,`
` ...but she was somehow very childish, and...`
`...how should I say it, too honest?`
` ......She gave me the impression that she didn't know anything about the world."`
`"If I had to describe it, ...it was almost as though she had come from a fairy‐tale land.`
` ......She was a truly mysterious person."`
`"......What happened after that?`
` ...Did you end up talking about Dad at all?"`
`"Yes.`
` Once every few days, sometimes on an arranged day and sometimes suddenly,`
` Father would appear casually, and they would drink tea together, or take a walk together or something, she said.`
` And that, by coincidence, she was by herself on the day I visited."`
`"I see.`
` Truly a mistress, then.`
` ...My, my.`
` I don't know how much younger she was, but... not bad, Father."`
`"......I remain firmly convinced that it was not an indecent relationship."`
`"Gosh, you are an idiot. There's no way a lover's meeting between a man and a woman wouldn't have {i:some} sensuality.`
` What happened next?`
` What did you talk about after that?"`
`".........Because I had introduced myself, I then asked her about herself."`
`"...When I did, the atmosphere quickly grew depressing.`
` ......How should I say it, she seemed very listless and lonely.`
` ...It was the same expression as the one I had first seen on her face."`
`"Well, that's because she was his hidden mistress.`
` If she just walked around wherever she liked, she might have been discovered by Mother.`
` ......I'm sure the situation was almost like house arrest."`
`"Even though she had beautiful clothes, a beautiful mansion, and a garden, she must have felt very constrained.`
` No surprise she felt it hard.`
` .........And then?"`
`"There was definitely something on her mind.`
` ......I remember getting the impression that it wasn't something that I could resolve just by talking to her,`
` and feeling very sad about it as well."`
`".........She seemed to have forgotten that I was even there.`
` ...She was gazing vaguely off into the distance, and was silent for a long, long time."`
`"...I thought that I must have said something wrong,`
` ......but it didn't seem to be the type of atmosphere where I could offer words of apology...`
` ......So, I too remained silent for a long, long time, until she remembered that I was there..."`
`When she did, ......she muttered unexpectedly.`
`".........Are there really no wolves beyond the fence?"`
`"...Hmm?`
` Y‐yes.`
` I've never seen wolves even in a zoo."`
`"What is this "zoo"?"`
`"Ah, ...it's a place where they keep all kinds of animals.`
` They're full of rare animals like elephants and giraffes and pandas."`
`"..............................`
` ...Are there no wolves in a zoo?`
` Then, umm, ...that might not be scary."`
`"Even if there were wolves, all of the animals are put in cages, so it's safe.`
` So you can feel safe as you look at and learn about them."`
`The witch of the forest, of all people, was for some reason scared of and didn't like wolves.`
`I remember it looked pretty comical.`
`"..................`
` ...How does that differ from myself?"`
`"............Huh?"`
`She didn't even know about zoos.`
`I explained how fun zoos could be,`
` but it was very difficult to get a person like her, who had never been to one, to understand...`
`Quite the opposite, as I explained it to her, her expression grew increasingly dismal.`
`...She couldn't see the difference.`
`It seemed that, although this mansion surrounded by a high fence appeared at a glance to afford her a completely provided‐for life of comfort,`
` she couldn't see how she was different from the animals shut up in cages...`
`"Who am I?`
` ......Everyone calls me {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...And that does certainly seem to be the name of a great witch, as you say."`
`"......But that is not me.`
` I cannot use any magic.`
` ......I simply have the soul of that witch sealed inside my body."`
`"..................?"`
`There was definitely something mysterious about her.`
` It wasn't just that she was somehow at odds with the world,`
` but it seemed that she truly believed that a thing called magic actually exists.`
`I think she talked about various weird things, but I don't remember the details.`
`All I thought was:`
` ......this might be a pitiful person.`
`She was unable to leave this mansion of her own will, a prisoner without even realizing it.`
`......And she didn't know anything about the outside world, didn't even understand who she was.`
`......She probably vaguely understood herself that she was pitiful.`
`But since she didn't know anything, it seemed that she couldn't realize that this was unhappiness.`
`Nee‐san, long ago, when I told you that I felt sorry for a bird in a cage, I remember you said this to me.`
`"A bird that only knows the inside of a cage doesn't long for the outside".`
`But she wasn't a bird.`
`{n}She was, ultimately, a human.`
`Even if she had never been outside the cage, she understood that it wasn't the whole world.`
`So,`
` .........I invited her.`
`"Do you want to try...`
`...going outside the fence?"`
`".........Th‐there really aren't any wolves?"`
`"There aren't.`
` You'll definitely be safe."`
`"..............................`
` ......I want to leave.`
` But the gate is always closed."`
`"There's the place I came in through.`
` There's a crack you can slip through."`
`"......If we go through there, is there a world outside?"`
`"Yes."`
`"........................There really aren't any wolves?"`
`"*giggle*.`
` No, none at all."`
`".............................."`
`I had only planned to invite her for a short walk,`
` ...but she kept looking over her shoulder at the mansion, as though she were seriously deliberating over something.`
`Then I learned what she was preparing herself for.`
`"...............I...have had enough of this place.`
` ......I want to go...outside.`
` And I want to know...who I am, what's happening in this world,`
` ...and the purpose for which I was born."`
`I didn't know what her life had been like until then.`
`It was probably something that she couldn't express easily.`
`If it was harsh, she just had to say that she wanted to escape.`
`{n}If it was sweet, she just had to say that she would stay.`
`To liken it to something,`
` perhaps it was similar to how a hot fireplace on a winter day makes the air get thicker and thicker, giving you a headache...?`
`Even though you know that you shouldn't keep things the way they are, you still need the courage to open the window and be tormented by the cold wind...`
`She was starting to realize that she couldn't stay there forever.`
`She was starting to realize that she had to go outside sometime.`
`But, since she didn't know about the outside world,`
` to take that first step outside must have required an unimaginable amount of courage...`
`And she had taken that into consideration, and resolved herself.`
`She had put that resolution to go outside into words, for what was surely the first time in her entire life.`
`...I hesitated slightly.`
`{n}It had been decided that she would live here by Father.`
`{n}It was as if she were Father's beloved bird in a cage.`
`If I just let her escape,`
` ......wouldn't I be harshly scolded by Father...?`
`"I want to see."`
`".........Hm?`
` See what?"`
`"I want to see...a zoo."`
`".....................ah."`
`I was just a little surprised when she finally showed me a very soft smile.`
`That might have been...`
`an inner peace, coming from her newfound readiness to venture out from her cage.`
`A soft smile which I wouldn't have imagined could have come out of that dark face...`
`"......When I speak with you, I keep hearing about things I don't know.`
` ...I don't know about this thing called school, nor about zoos.`
` I don't know about movie theaters.`
` I don't know about amusement parks."`
`".........And I think, from the bottom of my heart, that I want to know about them.`
` ...Will you take me there?"`
`"Huh? ......Y‐yes."`
`...I was nervous about how I would do it and keep it a secret from Father,`
` ...but her face looked so happy, so I went along with her and nodded.`
`But it seemed that the meaning behind my vague expression was not communicated to her.`
`It seemed that she believed that I would really take her to all of those places if we left.`
`She was pure and genuine.`
` ......She had probably never been tricked by anyone.`
` No, ......maybe it should be said that she hadn't been taught how to doubt.`
`Her face was somewhat radiant, and yet pathetic.`
`{n}...I wanted to somehow grant her modest wish.`
`"I...have had enough of {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I want to know who I am.`
` I want to start out as a new human, not {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"So, I want you to take me from here.`
` .........I don't need tea anymore.`
` I don't need this dress.`
` I won't meet with Kinzo again.`
` ......Please, take me from here.`
` Rosa."`
`However, that responsibility was one that a child such as me couldn't possibly bear fully.`
`But her serious gaze and her brilliant smile,`
` ...almost as though an evil spirit had lifted from her,`
` ......made me feel a little courage start to rise up inside myself.`
`This was definitely something that would get me in a lot of trouble.`
`{n}......But it was definitely the right thing to do.`
`I don't know how it will turn out, but......`
` ......I'll take her out.`
`Of course, I won't be able to ask help from Father, and not Mother either.`
`.........Should I talk to Onii‐sama or Onee‐sama?`
`{n}No, what about that reliable Genji‐san, or...`
`that's right, what about Kumasawa‐san, to whom I can always talk when I'm in trouble.`
`I'm sure they'll be able to do something.`
`Anyway, for now, I'll take her out of here.`
`{n}Because this is no longer a place where she wishes to be.`
`......And so, I took her to the crack in the fence and led her outside.`
`She was all nervous, checking to make sure there were no wolves around,`
` but after that fear disappeared,`
` she seemed somehow to be having fun even just walking around this dense forest.`
`Every time she found something, she would ask me about it.`
`{n}And they were all really minor things.`
`......What's that flower?`
` What's that leaf?`
` And that sound?`
` And that smell?`
`It was really like...the inside of that fence had been her entire world.`
`So, to her, who had stepped {i:out} of the world, this was.........`
`......You know, it's strange.`
`In the beginning, when I first saw her, I thought that she was the absolute incarnation of a witch relaxing by a witch's mansion.`
`But now it was different.`
` Or actually, the complete opposite.`
`......She had gone out of a world she had believed to be finite, and was full of joy at realizing for the first time that the world was endless.`
`So everything she saw was new.`
`{n}......It was almost as though she was the one who had been thrown into a fairy tale.`
`If she was Alice, then I felt almost like a rabbit holding a watch......`
`To her, it was probably a really fun walk, filled to the brim with excitement.`
` ...But as for me, the truth was, I was completely bewildered.`
`......After all, I had walked randomly to get there.`
`{n}So there was no way I could have known the way back to the mansion.`
`There were no lights in the forest, and I hadn't brought a flashlight.`
`{n}I realized that it would be terrible if it got dark while we were still like this, and grew impatient.`
`She was too innocent,`
` and apparently, she couldn't understand at all how frightening it would be to face the night inside the forest.`
`But I was the one who had brought her outside.`
`{n}...Somehow, I had to take responsibility, and resolve this situation.`
`So I thought.`
` ......That for now we should just go out to the sea.`
`{n}If we then followed the coast around, eventually we should definitely be able to make it back to the mansion.`
`However, that was much more of a problem than I had imagined.`
`{n}...After all, I didn't have a map or a compass.`
`There was no way I could walk in a straight line through an uncultivated forest, and I had immediately lost my sense of direction.`
`I already had no clue which trail I had come by, and was completely lost...`
`At this rate, night would definitely fall before I even knew where I was walking.`
`But I didn't have the luxury to complain.`
`Because that woman following behind me was so innocent and having so much fun.`
` ...Therefore, for the sake of her smile if nothing else,`
` I absolutely had to guide her out of this forest.`
`Gritting my teeth so that I didn't show her a troubled face,`
` I pushed my way onward through the pathless woods.`
`And, although we had various troubles, we were lucky enough to make it to the sea...`
`At that time, I still didn't even have a clue where I was on the island,`
` but for the time being, I was just a little reassured, realizing that if I just went around this way, I would surely be able to return to the mansion.`
`Of course, although I said that we reached the sea, we were on the top of a rocky cliff.`
` The beach was far below us.`
`I was tired from walking around the forest for so long,`
` so I thought that even though it was a rocky beach, an open area would probably be much easier to walk in.`
`So I planned to somehow go down the rocky cliff.`
`{n}...It did look pretty dangerous, and I wondered if there was some other way.`
`However, {f:5:Beatrice} agreed with my plan without any doubts.`
`......Even though she was probably older than me,`
` ...she obeyed me truly obediently, almost as though she were some kind of chick who believed I was a mother bird.`
`I searched to see if there wasn't some place where I could go down the cliff.`
` ...Then I found a place where the cliff had crumbled into a slope.`
`.......It looked a little dangerous,`
` but if I went down on both hands and both legs, like I was crawling, I thought it would probably be okay.`
`"......Let's go down here.`
` It'll be dangerous if you aren't careful,`
` but for now, if we go down to the beach and walk along it, I think we can avoid getting lost any more."`
`"Mmhm.`
` If you will do that, then let's go.`
` I find this getting lost to be fun also.`
` I'm very happy."`
`.........She really had no sense of danger.`
`{n}There was probably no mistake that she had lived a life without discomfort.`
`Even though she knew it would get dark when night fell,`
` she couldn't imagine how dangerous the inside of a forest could be without a light.`
`Furthermore, it seemed that she couldn't grasp at all how dangerous it might be if she fell from the cliff.`
`I warned her once more to be careful.`
`I cautiously examined the place where we could go down.`
`{n}...It looked......pretty high up.`
`{n}I think it might have been about ten meters down.`
`If you looked at it from the bottom up, it would probably have looked shorter than the roof of the mansion.`
` But looking from the top, it felt almost like staring down from the Tokyo Tower's observation room.`
`But {f:5:Beatrice} still appeared to be completely without fear.`
` ...It felt as though she had never even been taught that high places were dangerous.`
`......No, maybe she truly believed that she was a witch,`
` and that she could fly, so there wasn't anything dangerous.`
`"Please be careful.`
` ...It's pretty...high."`
`"Mmhm.`
` I will be careful.`
` I see there's a beach if we go down there.`
` Is there an aquarium there?"`
`"No, there are no aquariums on this island.`
` But I think there are lots of fish in the sea."`
`"I see.`
` So there are fish.`
` Are there, ...umm, whales and dolphins and penguins, like you talked about?"`
`"No, you would have to go to an aquarium for those.`
` ......And there aren't any aquariums unless you leave this island."`
`"Is that so?`
` ......But I look forward to it.`
` What kind of fish are whales?"`
`"Umm, ...they're really big fish and...huh, aren't they mammals?`
` And they spit out seawater."`
`"Hoh.`
` Then the dolphins?"`
`"Umm, they're really smart fish and...{0}huh...{0}aren't they also mammals?`
` They're really smart and they can be taught tricks and stuff."`
`"Hohhoh.`
` Then what about penguins?"`
`"Umm, ...huh, weren't they birds...?"`
`"What's this?`
` Didn't you say that there were fish in aquariums?"`
`"Ummm, ummm...`
` Well, um, there isn't only fish, they're full of all kinds of things that live in the ocean."`
`"Hohhoh.`
` I am really looking forward to that!`
` .........nn—"`
`{a:c:`
`Wa, hyaa.}`
`She made...some might have described it as a funny,`
` ...rushed and short voice,`
` ...no, probably it was a scream, I think.`
`She suddenly made a sound like that.`
`......Her body separated from the cliff, and gently fell down.`
`I immediately thought to say to her.`
`{n}"How many times did I warn you to be careful!"`
`......It was the thought of a child.`
` It was how a child immediately gets mad when something happens, trying to show that they are not at fault.`
`Of course, I said it too.`
`{n}Are you alright?`
` How many times did I warn you......`
`"...............So,`
` ...after she fell from the cliff,`
` ...what happened?"`
`"..........................."`
`"......What happened to her?`
` ...Rosa."`
`Rosa fell silent.`
` ...Her gaze fell to her feet, ...as though she were seeing through the floor to some disgusting memory...`
`"She...died, right......?"`
`Eva's brutal words were the ones that Rosa had most wanted to avoid.`
`And when she was hit with them, ......she screamed in resignation.`
`"Yes, she died!!`
` It was a rocky beach, many sharp and dangerous rocks lay exposed!!`
` Her eyes were still open, the blood kept pouring out... Suddenly a red carpet was spreading out...!"`
`"I spoke to her, shook her!!`
` But she refused to respond, not even a blink, ......no, she wouldn't even close her eyelids!!"`
`"It was my fault!`
` She was wearing a dress, remember?!`
` Even though I knew that her outfit was difficult to move in, I said that we should go down the cliff!!`
` She was incredibly innocent, so she obeyed what I said without any doubts...!!"`
`"......How long do you plan on remaining dead?`
` Open your eyes already.`
` Honestly, just turning into a lump of meat without me."`
`"I was just flirting with your friend the sexy‐assed chick.`
` ......More importantly, what is all this?"`
`"Mmm.`
` It is as you see.`
` ......I missed my footing, fell down,`
` {i:and died}."`
`"What did you say...`
` .........Even though you appeared as the 19th person,`
` ......you say you died......?"`
`"Don't mess with me, that can't be...!`
` Auntie Rosa was a kid, and she was panicking.`
` It's not like there was a doctor.`
` She probably made a mistake, thinking you were dead, and you probably, umm, ......were in a state of apparent death, or something, but actually alive.`
` Right?!"`
`It can't be.`
` She's obviously alive.`
`{n}Otherwise, she wouldn't be here in front of me, right...?!`
`...The kid‐aged Auntie Rosa was shaking {f:5:Beatrice}'s body, crying.`
`I too stared into that face,`
` ...............but her eyes were still open, and it really was a corpse.`
`...I wanted to brush it off with something vague like a state of apparent death,`
` ......but from any angle, there was nothing "apparent" about it; ...she really didn't look anything but dead...`
`{f:5:Beatrice} had fallen upside‐down from a cliff of that height,`
` ......and her head had smashed against the pointed tip of those sharp rocks.`
`............You would die, wouldn't you,`
` ......from that height,`
` ......on those rocks......`
`But I can't accept that...`
`No matter how dead she looks, ......she has to be alive...!`
` And she became this damn irritating witch!`
` That way, all of the inconsistencies fit.`
`She'd been confined by Grandfather in a hidden mansion the whole time.`
`And then to avenge herself, she planned out her revenge,`
` ......and would go on to commit a number of atrocious murders!`
`Auntie Rosa probably just mistakenly thought that she was dead.`
` But she was really alive, and as soon as Auntie Rosa left, she miraculously started breathing again.`
`......And then she somehow lived until today, and would open the curtain on the scene of her revenge.`
`Otherwise, the facts don't fit together!!`
`"......I won't let you trick me so easily.`
` Can you repeat it in red?!`
` That she died for certain!!`
` She has to be alive, right?!`
` It's obvious!!"`
`"How does {i:that} look like {i:being alive} to you?`
` {p:1:She's definitely dead}!"`
`".................................mgghhhh..."`
`My theory that the 19th person was Grandfather's mistress, who was a human {f:5:Beatrice}, broke down.`
`...I thought I had managed to segue from a defensive position into a counterattack, but......`
`"......Then, ......who are you?`
` You just died, this very minute!`
` You aren't going to say that you revived yourself with magic, are you?!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` I think that I've already explained it, though."`
`"......The me that is lying over there definitely has my soul,`
` but that body was nothing more than a cage of flesh tying me to the physical world.`
` And that cage of flesh was thus broken.`
` ......Do you understand what that means?"`
`"...............I don't have a clue anymore.`
` ......Keep having fun with your witch‐girl talk.`
` I'll listen instead of eating a cookie!`
` What the... It's empty.`
` Hey, could I get some more black tea?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Ronove.`
` Our guest wants some black tea."`
`When Beato clapped her hands, Ronove appeared.`
`......Butlers sure are convenient.`
`"A refill, is it?`
` Certainly.`
` How much shall I pour you?"`
`"Well, I've got more than enough to go with it.`
` Half will be fine."`
`"Filling it to the brim regardless is the English custom."`
`Even though just enough to wet my throat would have been fine, he filled it to the top with tea.`
`I turned my back to Beato, sipping it in silence...`
`"Wait... Open your eyes...!!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}...!!"`
`Rosa shook me,`
` ............no, shook the corpse that had once been me.`
`I watched over her from a short distance away.`
`Ah, ...so I fell from there and died.........`
`I believed that was true for a while.`
` ...After that, I saw Rosa spend a long time beside my corpse, then watched her as she ran away.`
`......Eventually, I realized that I was a different individual from that corpse...`
`".....................That's right.`
` I am......me.`
` ...So, I have finally been able to escape from Kinzo's restrictions..."`
`Eventually, I felt the memory returning...`
`{n}The fact that I was an Endless Witch who had lived for one thousand years.`
`And then I remembered that I had been summoned by Kinzo, and for a long time, had been imprisoned by him...`
`While I had been imprisoned in a cage of flesh, I had completely lost my memory as a witch.`
`However, thanks to Rosa, if you could say that...`
`Thanks to my accidental but fortunate death, I had now finally brought myself together......`
`"......Rosa.`
` You are probably regretting that you brought about my death.`
` But as for me, I could even thank you.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`Rosa was already nowhere to be seen.`
` Had she gone to call a doctor, or had she escaped from a scene which had become frightening?`
`...That no longer matters.`
`{n}That soulless shell is no longer worth anything.`
`All that aside, ......how frail I am now.`
`{n}Even this glorious midday sun is agony to me now.`
`I destroyed my human form.`
`{n}Then I changed it to several gold butterflies.`
`......Yes, with my magic power as frail as it is now, this form is easier.`
`And to escape even a little from the light of the sun, I rode the wind and lightly passed over the cliff.`
`It will probably be somewhat cooler in the forest.`
`Anyway, I'll take some time to recuperate, and regain my original power.`
`......As I think of how I will pay Kinzo back for all he has done.`
`Dancing alone through the air, I looked down at the shore one more time.`
`On the rocky shore lay the figure I had once possessed, ......and that I would eventually regain.`
`To regain the form of that physical body I have thrown away,`
` ...it will probably take more than one hundred, two hundred days.`
`...It might require one thousand days, or maybe even more.`
`However, I am the Endless Witch.`
`{n}The Golden Witch who has lived for one thousand years.`
`{n}Waiting any countable number of days is no problem at all.`
`*cackle*cackle*. Oh, Kinzo.`
`{n}You may regret that you are not here now.`
`{n}No longer will you be able to capture me.`
`{n}...*cackle*cackle*!`
`".........And then, you changed into gold butterflies, hid in the forest, and waited for your magic power to be restored? Is that what you're saying?"`
`"That is correct.`
` I take this form to sneer at you, but normally, it is easier magically for me to keep my form as gold butterflies."`
`"Don't stress yourself and stay in an easy form.`
` I wouldn't mind not hearing your irritating laugh."`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` When I turned into butterflies and slipped into the forest, it was already no longer possible for Kinzo to find me.`
` ......However, Kinzo was not about to stand there doing nothing.`
` Still, he would be unable to immediately prepare a way to catch me."`
`"Therefore, he first moved immediately to prevent me from leaving this island,`
` and to keep me from regaining my power."`
`".........My, my. All I can say is that Kinzo's tenacity does defy the imagination.`
` ...It is pretty tough to be loved by someone like that.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"A way to keep you from leaving after you became butterflies?`
` What, did he put a bug net around the entire forest?"`
`"Indeed.`
` He did the magical equivalent.`
` .........Did you know?`
` On the sea in front of the harbor floats a reef, on which sits a small shrine of Eastern magic."`
`"......Ah, that.`
` It was gone this year, though.`
` It was a small shrine built long ago by a mountaineering ascetic, right?"`
`"This island was originally an island of distortions.`
` Magical beings and other beings of similar ilk were attracted to it.`
` ......Milady herself is one of them, I imagine.`
` How about some more tea?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*, please.`
` ......They did harm to humans, and probably left several eerie legends behind them."`
`"That small shrine was built in ancient times by an Eastern mage who heard of them.`
` A long time passed, and that power was lost.`
` By repairing it, Kinzo restored this island's barrier, and once again tied me to this island."`
`"......Can Eastern magic work on a Western witch like you?"`
`"Normally the affinity is poor.`
` However, for the purpose of sealing me there, in a way, it might have been suitable."`
`"If it was Western magic, I would have some knowledge.`
` For any barrier, there would have been some measures I could have taken.`
` But Eastern magic is outside my area of expertise.`
` It was as if I had been given chopsticks instead of a spoon for some soup I was trying to eat."`
`"In a space strongly controlled by Eastern magic, Western magic loses much of its power.`
` It would likely have taken her a thousand days to regain her power even under normal circumstances,`
` and now it would take her much, much longer."`
`"......So you're trying to say that it took you twenty years to regain your power, and now you are revived, like this?"`
`"Those were horribly long years...`
` I spent many days in the form of gold butterflies, found Kinzo's mansion, and watched over him every day.`
` I lived through those days with no means to enjoy myself except to ponder how I would get back at him."`
`"......What was fortunate for me was that during those twenty years,`
` Kinzo tried to use every magic to find and capture me, and failed in them all."`
`"A human cannot bring about miracles very many times.`
` Even simply holding me captive for that long had been a miracle far above his place.`
` It would be unthinkable for me to be captured like that multiple times."`
`".........Grandfather said something in the previous game.`
` It was something like, magic dwells in probabilistic miracles."`
`"Mmhm.`
` While Kinzo searched for a hidden art to capture me again, he ended up at that.`
` ...............Then, he finally worked out the ritual involving the offering of thirteeen sacrifices to revive me again."`
`"Thirteen......sacrifices..."`
`"That is the witch's epitaph.`
` It is a poem of sacrifices.`
` ......Six people on the first twilight.`
` Two people on the second twilight.`
` And then five more people on the fourth through eighth twilights.`
` A forbidden ritual, involving the offering of a total of thirteen people as sacrifices...`
` Those sacrifices are chosen randomly, and the one holding the ritual, Kinzo himself, is not an exception."`
`"You're out of your mind...`
` Are you saying that all of the gruesome murders that occurred on this island were all part of a weird ritual?!!"`
`I was vaguely thinking that this might be a possibility...`
`But I can't just hear that this is the truth from a witch and a demon and say "Oh, really?" and accept it!`
`"There are eighteen people on Rokkenjima.`
` Thirteen are sacrificed; only five are left alive.`
` Then I revive."`
`"......In other words, the odds that Kinzo will be able to meet me again are probably around one third.`
` He bet his own life on those odds,`
` wishing for a reunion with me for the last bit of his remaining life."`
`".........You're saying he gathered our family for the sake of that fucked‐up ritual?!`
` Oh, yeah, real fucking funny!!`
` Don't say stuff like that, damn it!!"`
`"It was according to the contract from the beginning.`
` When Kinzo's life ended,`
` all of the gold I had lent him, and all of the assets that Kinzo had created, were to be received by me."`
`"......Kinzo put me through a nightmareish ordeal,`
` but thinking back on it now, it was an extraordinary period, even amid the past thousand years.`
` After all, the natural enemy of a witch is boredom.`
` To Kinzo, who offered me a chance to run away from that for several decades,`
` yes, considering that among other things, I might have a slight debt to him."`
`"I decided to go along with Kinzo's game.`
` And so, first off, Kinzo returns to me the Ushiromiya family Head's Ring.`
` It is the house revived by my gold, you see."`
`".........Then I choose thirteen people arbitrarily as sacrifices.`
` And as that unfolds, you people are thrown into total confusion,`
` and show me various aspects of the fabric of human relationships as you stand against me, which gives me great pleasure.`
` I really do like this game of Kinzo's!`
` *cackle*cackle*."`
`"Aaaaaaaaaahh!!`
` I definitely won't believe in that kind of magic story!`
` ......Then who are you?!`
` You fell off a cliff and died, dammit!`
` Your soul slipped out, became butterflies, and went to the forest?`
` That's all a load of bullshit!!"`
`"But you are here!`
` Who are you?!!`
` Aren't you the 19th person?!"`
`"That is true, I most surely am the 19th person.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` But it's no good, I'm afraid...?`
` It's no goddamn good at all!!"`
`"`
`{p:1:There are no more than 18 humans on this Rokkenjima}!"`
`"Wha, ...............what did you saaaaaaay......`
` So you're saying......the X of the 18+X doesn't exist?!`
` Are you saying the piece that I took...{0}{nobreak:the X}...{0}doesn't exist?!"`
`"Pu ku ku ku...`
` That is what it means.`
` You have my condolences.`
` ...However, Milady, you truly are a fast worker.`
` I thought you would let him flounder around a little more before turning everything over at the end.`
` Well then, Battler‐sama, would some more tea be agreeable to you?"`
`"I, I don't want any, damn it!!`
` I don't believe!`
` The culprit can't be one of the 18!"`
`"Then, what the hell are you, why are you here?!!`
` If the 19th person doesn't exist, then are you saying you're one of the 18 in disguise?!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` For you, although you are reluctant to use it,`
` doubting one of the 18 will serve as a final escape route, much like castling."`
`".........However, for me, the hard part is just beginning.`
` You need only throw away appearances,`
` and you can prepare a culprit freely amid the 18 people!`
` Finding a route through those 18 pieces,`
` in order to checkmate you and force you to accept me,`
` .........will be truly difficult."`
`"Like hell I'd do that!!`
` I won't doubt any of the 18!`
` I don't want to doubt!!`
` Have I really been cornered here again...?!`
` Damn it, damn it damn it!!"`
`"It looks like my game with you, which has lasted three rounds, is finally entering the endgame, doesn't it?`
` There's nowhere to run anymore, you know?`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` You don't want to doubt any of those beloved people in the 18, riiight? I can take that burden from you if you want?`
` And yet, why do you refuse me?"`
`"They say you should play the opening like a book, the middle game like a magician,`
` and the endgame like a machine.`
` I'll corner you from here on.`
` Slowly, carefully, ...surely.`
` Or, on the other hand, would it be better if I pressed you all at once, as would be fitting for you?"`
`"That should suit you, let's do that.`
` I already have a thorough knowledge of which methods of attack you cannot handle!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle* hihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!!"`
`"...........................Now then.`
` How will the game be resolved this time?`
` ...You may submit, and you may resist.`
` ......Either way, it will truly be an entertaining banquet worth betting my short remaining life on."`
`In his dimly lit study, which was occasionally brightened by lightning,`
` Kinzo kept mumbling to himself, laughing to himself.`
`On the antique clock with an intricate design that was sitting on his desk,`
` the two overlapping hands had begun to tilt to the right, and separate from one another.`
`The passage of time that had counted to 24 had returned to 0, and begun to start counting again...`
`"......The passage of time is a brutal thing.`
` It drags itself all the way to 24 over the course of a day, and then returns back to 0.`
` ......It surely managed to count to 23:59.`
` However, was it ever able to reach 24:00?`
` ......If you believe that it returns to 0:00 again without reaching it, how futile it seems."`
`No, is that not the same as a person's life?`
` You live, aiming for a perfect 24, and in the instant you reach it, you return to 0.`
`People may praise the departed, saying that they did reach 24, but that is absolutely not 24.`
`.........It is nothing more than 0.`
`"I am different.`
` ......I will reach 24 alive.`
` Because that itself is the Golden Land.`
` ...That is {f:5:Beatrice}'s dwelling."`
`Kinzo had been fumbling around with some tarot cards for some time.`
`It looked as though he was trying to divine his own luck, his own propensity for victory, and doing it over every time he didn't like the result.`
`The most forbidden action in tarot reading is to try predicting the same thing twice.`
`It is a desecration to the result of the fortune telling,`
` and also desecrates the existence higher than humans which delivers signs through the tarot cards.`
`However, Kinzo knew.`
`The reason the tarot cards shouldn't be used twice was that, since it was nothing more than a random number generator,`
` it was natural that if you read them twice, a different result would appear.`
`......Therefore, reading twice was only forbidden to preserve the mystique of the tarot cards' results.`
`...However, that didn't mean that Kinzo didn't take tarot reading seriously.`
`Kinzo's interpretation of tarot reading was done in a completely different way.`
`That was to repeat the reading, over and over, until he reached the result most favorable to him,`
` without the slightest amount of compromise.`
`It would depend on how he defined the result most favorable to him,`
` but if he demanded the best result in a strict sense,`
` it would be the same as a simple roulette of luck, where he sought an arithmetic miracle.`
`......However, to Kinzo, who made miracles of numbers the basis of his magical power, this could become very much like a magic ritual.`
`In other words,`
` until the result he desired appeared perfectly, he would repeat the tarot readings over and over, turning his labor, conviction, and the feelings of his heart into a prayer,`
` so that when it reached heaven, the result would be sublimated—this was Kinzo's personal magical interpretation.`
`Therefore, even though the tarot cards Kinzo used were exactly the same as generally used tarot cards,`
` the way they were used was completely different...`
`".................................`
` ...Tonight, ......it refuses to go my way."`
`Kinzo stopped his hands for a second.`
`...It seemed the result he expected wasn't showing up.`
`On the contrary, many bad cards that shouldn't often appear were appearing repeatedly,`
` and continuing to interfere with the miracle Kinzo wished for.`
`"..................Hmph.`
` ...Is that how it is?"`
`It seemed that Kinzo had taken some kind of sign from this abnormal course of events.`
`But judging by the unlucky cards scattered over the desk, it was difficult to imagine that the sign had been a good one...`
`For a while, Kinzo closed his eyes tightly, pondering something.`
`Then as the thunder roared, he made up his mind about something, took the telephone receiver, and dialed.`
`"............It is I.`
` Is Genji there? It is urgent."`
`"..................haah."`
`In front of the main entrance, Shannon was cooling her flushed face in the frigid air.`
`...She had thought...`
`...that George's proposal would surely come sometime.`
`It wasn't as if her heart had been unprepared.`
`{n}And she had nodded as an answer.`
`Had she been reckless because of her youth?`
`{n}Should she have thought about her future more seriously?`
`She found herself worrying that he might have thought of her as a cheap girl because of her immediate reply.`
`...Perhaps at least holding off until tomorrow morning would have given the impression of thinking more seriously?`
`Now that she had already received the ring from George,`
` Shannon kept fidgeting in embarrassment, thinking she should have done this, should have done that.`
`As she did, she heard the sound of footsteps coming towards her, splashing through puddles.`
`Shannon immediately chased away the emotions welling up inside her.`
`"......Genji‐sama?`
` Kanon‐kun too...!`
` I, I'm sorry, for not coming back right away, umm..."`
`She grew stiff, thinking that she would surely be scolded for spending too much time in her secret lover's meeting with George.`
`"Shannon.`
` The Master has told us to come to the study urgently.`
` Let us hurry."`
`"......Huh?`
` Y‐yes, certainly...!`
` What in the world...?"`
`"He said he had an ominous premonition.`
` ......How selfish, when he was the one who chose to start this ritual."`
`"We will enter from the back, so that Gohda doesn't notice us.`
` Hide your footsteps."`
`"Yes.`
` .........Nee‐san, take care.`
` You're so noisy."`
`Kanon was especially good at hiding his presence.`
`...Like he was a cat.`
` He was able to suddenly be there without anyone noticing, and leave in the same way.`
`So, even if he were to step in a puddle,`
` the sound he would make would be far smaller than that of the rain hitting the puddles...`
`Genji also had that ability.`
` ...Well, in the first place, that was how the servants were supposed to be, even going by the name of furniture.`
`Just like how desks and closets go unnoticed by members of the family,`
` the servants also treated being able to show up unobtrusively when they needed to as their greatest virtue.`
`In that sense, Shannon's footsteps still strongly asserted themselves.`
`...She was also trying to hide her footsteps,`
` but compared to Kanon and Genji, well, you could say she was a little more lively...`
`Eventually they reached the back door, and the three of them entered the mansion.`
`Immediately, .........they thought they felt something.`
`It wasn't quite a sense of smell, ...rather, they felt it from the depths of their noses,`
` ......and this hard‐to‐describe sensation, which you might call a sixth sense, allowed them to perceive that something was different than usual.`
`"............Genji‐sama."`
`"...Yes. We must hurry."`
`That perception caused them to feel that something tense was closing in on them.`
`Realizing that, the three of them dashed up the stairs, aiming for Kinzo's study, still hiding their footsteps.`
`When they dashed up the stairs, ...that smell of sweet poison particular to Kinzo's study reached their noses.`
`".....................hm."`
`"What is it, Genji‐sama...?"`
`"......The barrier is...dead."`
`"Huh?`
` ...............Ah."`
`After hearing Kanon, she looked at the door to the study.`
`{n}A scorpion pattern was engraved on the doorknob.`
`A powerful magic‐repellent.`
` The final barrier, which protected Kinzo himself.`
`It had been broken.`
`Of course, there was no change to the doorknob that the eye could see.`
`{n}However, they who could understand things that people couldn't perceive, were able to recognize the dramatic change...`
`"......My lord.`
` My lord...!`
` It is Genji.`
` Please open this door."`
`Genji called in this way after knocking several times, but there was no answer from the study.`
`"Shannon, protect our backs.`
` Kanon, search inside the room."`
`""Yes...!""`
`Kanon put his ear against the door, searching for a presence inside the study.`
`To protect the backs of the other two, who were watching the door, Shannon faced the other way, with her back to them, prepared for the unexpected.`
`"............The Master is here, I believe.`
` ...However, it's too quiet."`
`"Then he is safe?"`
`"No.`
` It is {i:too quiet}."`
`"...It............couldn't be..."`
`"My lord.`
` Excuse us about the door."`
`Genji pulled a gold key out of his pocket.`
`{n}It was the only key to the study that existed, other than the one Kinzo held.`
`He stuck it in the keyhole, and turned it heavily.`
`{n}......At a glance, that would have indicated that it really was a strong lock.`
`However, the fact that the barrier had been destroyed...`
`meant that this door had long been wide open for anyone with magical power...`
`The lock made a heavy sound, indicating that the door had been opened {i:to humans as well}.`
`"......Excuse me."`
`As Genji respectfully bowed his head,`
` and Kanon's sense of tension grew tighter,`
` and Shannon acted nervous, they entered the study...`
`They immediately discovered Kinzo's figure.`
`......He was sitting in a reception sofa so that his back faced them.`
`Genji noticed the person sitting across from him, and again bowed deeply.`
`Kanon also noticed that person,`
` ......and he didn't bow his head.`
`He went in front of Shannon and spread both arms, blocking the way to her.`
`So without even seeing that person's face, Shannon already had a good idea who it was...`
`"...So you have come.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"Genji, is it?`
` You came very quickly.`
` Yes, it is better when furniture answers its master's call quickly.`
` Very different from this person."`
`"........................`
` ......So Ronove‐sama has come as well."`
`Genji directed his greeting towards the thin darkness behind and to the right of {f:5:Beatrice}, where nothing appeared to be.`
`Even Kanon and Shannon couldn't have imagined that someone would be there.`
`......However, the darkness answered immediately, and praised Genji's eyesight...`
`"As usual, you don't disappoint.`
` It has been quite some time.`
` .........Dear me, you have gotten old, haven't you?`
` Have you really reached that age?"`
`"I have lived a full life.`
` ...It appears that your life has grown to be even more full, Ronove‐sama."`
`"Yes.`
` Thank you.`
` .........And Shannon, it has been a long time since I last saw you, as well.`
` You have grown quite beautiful.`
` And, it seems that you have grown quite strong.`
` It is good to see."`
`"............Thank you very much."`
`"......Nee‐san, who in the world..."`
`"This will be the first time I have met you, Kanon‐kun.`
` ......I have been entrusted with the position of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's head furniture. My name is Ronove.`
` ......I am an old friend of Genji‐san's.`
` I am also furniture, just like you.`
` Although the master I serve is different."`
`The color of tension didn't disappear from Kanon's expression in the slightest.`
`......Serving under a different master, furniture could become kind, brutal, or anything else as desired.`
`...If he called himself furniture serving the hated {f:5:Beatrice},`
` then surely he was a despicable being as well...`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` It seems that I'm completely despised.`
` It's as though you hate everything to do with me."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} openly sneered at Kanon's hate‐filled face...`
`Then, Kanon finally observed.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} and Kinzo were enjoying a chess game, sitting in facing reception sofas.`
`But Kinzo hadn't even quivered.`
` He was holding his head with both hands, his eyes closed tight, ...as he contemplated his next move.`
`......No, was he in anguish...?`
`".........My lord........."`
`"I have told Kinzo two things.`
` There was good news and bad news.`
` ......The good news was that he would have the fortune of being reunited with me before the ritual even ends.`
` The bad news was that Kinzo had been selected for the very first sacrifice of the ceremony."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` There's absolutely nothing I can do about it.`
` Because it truly was decided by the fickle roulette."`
`"...L‐liar.`
` You just take pleasure in killing people......"`
`"Stop it, Kanon‐kun......"`
`"......So, Kinzo.`
` Isn't it about time you decided to accept your loss?`
` ......*cackle*, by this, our long lasting contest is resolved, right?"`
`"................................."`
`At a glance, you couldn't tell the current situation on that chaotic chessboard.`
`...However, judging from Kinzo's anguish and {f:5:Beatrice}'s malicious relaxedness,`
` it looked as though it was already decided...`
`"............It is unavoidable...`
` ...Is this also entertainment?"`
`"It is to me too.`
` ......Concluding my contest with you may bring a flood of emotions, but it has already surpassed love and hate.`
` ...It was fun.`
` Several decades that were not boring...!"`
`{f:5:Beatrice} advanced her queen, and made her final move.`
`......It was thus...`
`decided.`
`"Checkmate.`
` .........This is a final tribute from me to you.`
` Without reserve,`
` ...sleep."`
`"Heheheh,`
` ......fuhahaha,`
` haah`
`hah`
`hah`
`hah`
`hah`
`hah`
`hah!!"`
`Kinzo suddenly stood up and laughed, like an opera singer facing a full crowd and spreading his arms,`
` ...as though he had succeeded in a century‐long plan.`
`That laugh...`
`...spat crimson.`
`Crimson flames poured out from inside him,`
` spitting even out of his mouth, ears, and nose, and all at once, his body was wrapped in hellfire...`
`But Kinzo kept laughing.`
`The more he laughed, the more the hellfire spewed from his entire body, and began to char him...`
`Those flames became a brilliant light,`
` which dazzlingly shone on the various magic tools throughout the room, and made their distorted shadows dance across the walls.`
`...Those shadows looked like the dead in hell, in ecstasy over Kinzo as he burned...`
`And,`
` for one who had made a contract with a witch,`
` and who had reached the end of that contract,`
` ...it was an extremely fitting end...`
`After laughing and howling in the roaring flames for some time,`
` Kinzo flopped to the ground, as though he was a puppet whose strings had been cut.`
`Those incredible blazing flames disappeared as though they had burned up everything there was to burn,`
` and afterwards, all that was left was a festering and burnt body that would make you want to avert your eyes...`
`".....................Horrible..."`
`"Hmph.`
` You should talk.`
` Even though you think that was a fitting way for him to die..."`
`"......Why have you shown yourself...?`
` Do you have some business with us...?"`
`"Stop it, Kanon‐kun.`
` ......You must not provoke {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"It appears that you have completely terrified them.`
` Pu ku ku ku."`
`"It seems I just can't get along with Kanon.`
` A pity, I must say I quite like him myself...?"`
`{f:5:Beatrice} smiled broadly, or perhaps wickedly.`
`Kanon violently averted his gaze, obviously disturbed.`
`...His reaction was so different from what he had obviously intended that it made the witch and her butler laugh.`
`"Kanon.`
` ......You stand in the presence of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` Carefully consider your manner of speech."`
`"Oh, there is no problem, Genji.`
` Let him say as he likes.`
` I am gracious."`
`"......How are you gracious...!"`
`"I am always gracious to those who are about to die.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`Kanon was brought to sudden realization by that creepy laughter...`
`{f:5:Beatrice}'s reason for being here was not just to take Kinzo's life.`
`The first twilight required six sacrifices.`
`{n}Kinzo alone wasn't nearly enough.`
`{n}...And they had just nonchalantly come to this place...`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Don't worry, Kanon.`
` ......You won't be selected as sacrifices just because you came here.`
` ......It was because you were selected as sacrifices that you were called here...!"`
`".........What.........!"`
`They instinctively figured it out immediately...`
`Six sacrifices were required for the first twilight.`
`{n}After Kinzo, how many more would you need to add up to six?`
`......In this mansion, the number 5 instantly made them think of the number of servants here...`
`"............Is that...what you desire?"`
`"Mmhm.`
` ...Thank me, furniture.`
` Your days of suffering have tonight finally come to an end.`
` You should thank me, as I have come to tell you this."`
`".........Certainly.`
` If that is your desire."`
`"...G‐`
`......Genji‐sama..."`
`Genji had agreed to the witch's heartless announcement in his usual manner, without raising an eyebrow.`
`"After the Master's death, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is our master.`
` Answering her demand is our final duty.`
` ......Shannon.`
` Kanon.`
` You have done well serving until today.`
` That hard work is now over."`
`"......As I expected of you, Genji.`
` As fellow furniture, I think honorably of you."`
`"Shannon.`
` ......Do you have any objections?"`
`"......No."`
`".........I heard that George‐sama gave you a ring.`
` Even so, you have no regrets?"`
`"No.`
` ......That blessing was more than furniture deserves.`
` ...Just receiving the ring has already fulfilled my feelings."`
`Shannon had not yet reached as high of a philosophical state of mind as Genji.`
` There probably really were regrets left in her heart.`
` ...She probably wanted to spend a little more warm time with the person of her thoughts, George.`
`......But she released herself from that.`
` She took a single deep breath, and from that point on, the expression she wore was blank.`
`"...............Very good."`
`"I am a little surprised that you have been able to calm yourself this much, Shannon.`
` It seems that you have also come to terms with things as furniture."`
`"Won't you at least shed some bitter tears for not being able to spend a night with the man you love?`
` What a boring woman."`
`"............`
` .........This feeling cannot be understood by the likes of you, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` ......If you desire our lives, please accept them.`
` We will solemnly carry out that duty."`
`"......Good.`
` Well said..."`
`"Pu ku ku ku.`
` Just the type of person {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is bad with."`
`"Recently, this one has become quite detached.`
` ...It seems that I tortured her too much last time.`
` Speaking of which, didn't I do the same to Battler?"`
`"...Hmmm.`
` Am I still soft?`
` Or is my style of cornering them lacking?`
` In any case, she's just no fun."`
`".........However, it seems that you will still entertain me, right?`
` Kanooon?"`
`"............Kanon‐kun..."`
`".................."`
`Compared to the two who had attained a philosophical state of mind, ...there was a painful anguish on Kanon's face.`
`Kanon was still far too young to accept his demise without regrets,`
` after being told of it by a suddenly appearing witch...`
`"......Kanon.`
` I detest boredom more than anything.`
` And it isn't interesting that those other two have obediently accepted their deaths.`
` ......So I don't want you to betray my expectations."`
`"............Are you trying to make me your plaything...?"`
`Kanon realized that he was being provoked.`
`...However, no matter how much anger spurred him on, his opponent was a witch.`
` He was furniture.`
` He had no chance of victory from the beginning.`
`But the witch was expecting that he would struggle in vain and writhe around,`
` and was looking forward to it...`
`......Just thinking about that was frustrating enough to get his blood boiling.`
`Was disappointing the witch by refusing to resist, like the other two,`
` the only way he could strike back at her...?`
`"Eldest of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, Lucifer.`
` Arise."`
`"......Lucifer the Proud, right here."`
`"Kanon.`
` It would be too cruel to force furniture to fight a witch.`
` No matter how much anger spurs you on, you could hardly hold hope in a battle you have no chance of winning.`
` Of course, a battle without a chance of success would be boring for me as well."`
`"......So, furniture against furniture.`
` Why not resolve it with a battle between furniture?`
` That should be enough to allow you some hope for victory, right...?"`
`"..................`
` ...With all due respect, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` Is it truly possible that I could yield to this good‐for‐nothing furniture?"`
`"As if this cute kid would have any chance in hell against me...`
` Eheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheheh."`
`".................................kh."`
`"Show me that you can defeat my furniture of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory.`
` If you manage to come out the admirable victor,`
` .........hm, let us see..."`
`"I will let you have free choice over the five people who will escape becoming one of the 13 sacrifices.`
` I will unconditionally welcome the five people you recommend into the Golden Land.`
` ...How about that?"`
`Kanon understood that he was being provoked.`
`{n}......However, the witch's condition was very tempting.`
`The evil ritual the witch and the rest were trying to carry out was, at this point,`
` not something that Kanon cared about in the slightest.`
`......On the contrary, it was much more important for him to survive, be invited to the Golden Land,`
` ...and have his wish granted by {f:5:Beatrice} there...`
`"You cried that you'd had enough of being furniture, right...?`
` I shall grant your desire.`
` I shall give you that human body which you wanted so much that you cried yourself to sleep.`
` What do you say...?`
` Then you could be together with Jessica, right?`
` Ooh, just perfect.`
` You may include Jessica and yourself in the five you recommend for invitation to the Golden Land."`
`"......If you have some hesitation toward making only yourself happy,`
` then you can add Shannon and her loved one, George, as well.`
` If you're worried about duty, then you can also add Genji."`
`"Hoh!`
` That's five people.`
` Just enough room, Kanon.`
` .........With this much of a reward, ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` You won't let me get bored, will youuuu...?"`
`"......She's just playing with you.`
` There is no need to listen to her."`
`"I, ......I'm sick of this.`
` Is this really what you want, Nee‐san?!"`
`{f:5:Beatrice} couldn't hide her evil smile at those words.`
`"I'm sick of this.`
` I want to be happy!`
` I've had enough of being furniture.`
` I want to become human, ......and have normal love...!`
` I want to know that...the ocean is blue, like you!"`
`"............How young.`
` I'm jealous."`
`"That's why I like the young ones.`
` ......Genji, Shannon, stay back.`
` Kanon, Lucifer, forward."`
`"As you command."`
`".............................."`
`"...Hehheheheheheheheheheheh.`
` I don't like it.`
` ...You know you can't win against {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama,`
` but you look down on me as though you might be able to win against me...`
` ......I {i:really} don't like it."`
`That was probably humiliating to Lucifer.`
`...But at the same time, she was also happy that she was so lucky to have this lovely prey all to herself...`
`".........Come, furniture of the witch.`
` .........Don't think that you can look down on me forever...!"`
`"Come, now, Battler.`
` It is time for another fun show!`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`".........Damn.`
` It's turned into something ridiculous again...`
` Like I'd ever accept that it's a magic battle...!"`
`"Look, look, don't turn your eyes away, look at it.`
` Look look, look look!`
` It's magic, it's furniture,`
` no matter how much you try to deny me and magic,`
` look look, look look look look!"`
`"All this bwaan bwaan, ka‐shing ka‐shing, right in front of your eyes, it was all for nothing, riiiight?`
` Look look look look,`
` stop thinking already,`
` I told you magic exists!`
` I told you this is fantasy!`
` Don't close your eyes,`
` look closely,`
` look look look look look!!"`
`"Damn it, damn it damn it damn it...`
` I won't accept witches, I won't accept magic...!`
` But if it's as obvious as this, what the hell am I meant to say?!`
` ...............Damn, damndamndamn!"`
`"Come now, don't turn away, look closely, alriiiight??`
` Magic exists, it's fantasy, stop playing detective."`
`"I know all about it, the truth is you're awful at thinking about things, riiight??`
` Just stop, just stoooop, *cackle*cackle*!`
` Look look, obviously fantasy, obviously fantasy, kihhihi{0}hya{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyaa{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!"`
`"Shut up shut up shut uuuuuuuuuuup...!!!`
` Don't talk to meeeeeeee...!!"`
`".........This guy's gotten obstinate.`
` ...Get down on the ground right now and apologize for being so conceited that you thought you could "at least beat me".`
` If you do, I'll spare you, alright...?"`
`"I'll spare you from having your skin ripped off while you're still alive,`
` and being lashed all over your body as you squirm until you die.`
` Hehheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheheh!"`
`"You're a cute kid, so apologize...`
` If you do, you can spend your last moments in blissful, wonderful ecstasy as I gently, gently finish you off......"`
`"Be silent, furniture of the witch.`
` ...I have no intention of speaking with you."`
`"S‐......so you say that you think nothing of me, do you...?"`
`"Hehhheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheheh, I don't like it, that disrespectful gaze of yours...`
` I really don't like iiiiit!!"`
`"............Kanon‐kun..............."`
`"..........................."`
`"......Isn't he stronger than he was against Satan?"`
`"That is why humans are so frightening.`
` Sometimes they even become witches, and treat demons as butlers."`
`"Pu ku ku ku ku!`
` So, which should I cheer on?"`
`"...Are you...`
`......saying that this guy's on par with me...!"`
`".........Don't look down on me.`
` As long as you have that pride, you can never win against me."`
`"Y‐y‐`
`...you speak of Lucifer, the eldest of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, and say that I can never win?!`
` H‐how...conceited!!"`
`"...Wha..............."`
`Kanon was desperately trying to stay alive, and he had the strong desire to become human.`
`But Lucifer didn't feel anything stronger than a slight desire to play.`
`......So, that reached its inevitable result.`
` For the ability to yield such a result is the power of humans.`
` ...The power of the heart.`
`"...............That's as far as you go.`
` You can never win against me."`
`A glowing red trail extended straight out from Kanon's arm,`
` ......pointing at Lucifer's throat, just beneath the tip of her chin...`
`"Wh‐`
`......what is this...?!`
` How could I...`
` ......There...must be some mistake..."`
`As she ground her teeth in irritation, she tried to deny the reality right before her eyes.`
` ...But no matter how much she believed in her own superiority, it didn't change the facts right before her eyes.`
`"Hoh.`
` ...Well done, Kanon.`
` Wonderful, you haven't made me bored.`
` ......How pitiful my furniture is in comparison.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"......Lucifer.`
` You are boring Milady.`
` Was this opponent really too much for you to handle...?"`
`"I'm disappointed, eldest of the Seven Staaakes.`
` Kuhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi...!"`
`That would have seemed like nothing more than a simple rebuke to an outsider.`
`However, furniture serving the witch knew what kind of severe treatment was promised by that rebuke,`
` and understood what had been left unsaid...`
`"Uuuuuuuuuuuguuhhh!!`
` You......good‐for‐nothing FURNITU{-}U{-}U{-}U{-}U{-}U{-}U{-}U{-}U{-}U{-}U{-}UURE!!!"`
`She howled.`
` ...Abandoning her last bit of pride, she made her body explode, exposing her true form.`
`That form was a demon stake, which bounced and deflected off the walls all over the room...`
`"How could you shame me so much!!`
` I'll kill you, kill you kill you kill you!!`
` You slowpoke!`
` Even though you can't even follow my movements anymore!!`
` I won't play around anymore, I'm seriously mad, I'll pierce your heart in one blow!!"`
`"I'll plow right through you, and make a fountain of bright‐red blood reach the ceiling!!`
` DIIIII{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}IIEEEE!!"`
`"Ka‐Kanon‐kun.........!!"`
`With a speed exceeding even the limits that the human eye could follow,`
` Lucifer went wild, and flew at Kanon's heart...`
`Lucifer confirmed that the sweet taste she could feel was definitely Kanon's blood.`
`...But she quickly noticed.`
`{n}...She hadn't pierced Kanon's heart...`
`"............Hoh.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"This is why humans are frightening.`
` ...Would you like some black tea?"`
`"I am fine for now.`
` This is so interesting I don't need black tea...!"`
`"......K‐`
`............Kanon‐kun............"`
`"So arrogant......`
` ......That's why you can't win against me......"`
`The floor was stained with dripping blood.`
`...It really was Kanon's blood,`
` ......but it wasn't flowing out of his chest.`
`Kanon had sacrificed his own left hand to protect his heart...`
`Lucifer was arrogant.`
`Even though she had been given enough time to realize that this was an opponent capable of cornering her,`
` even so, in her pride, she had believed that he was a worthless opponent.`
` She had gotten careless.`
`......So just as she had announced, she had aimed for his chest, trying to pierce his heart.`
`Because she was arrogant, she hadn't even thought of aiming for somewhere other than the place she had announced.`
`...No, maybe she had thought about it a little.`
`{n}...However, her pride would not allow her to aim for a different spot.`
`Because she was...`
`......Lucifer the Proud.`
`Kanon, withstanding the pain,`
` grasped the demon stake sticking deep into his left hand strongly with his right,`
` ...and pulled it out......`
`The sound of breaking bones and even more blood dripping down could be heard.`
`{n}Shannon instinctively averted her eyes.`
`There was an air hole in the back of the pierced hand so big that you could clearly see through to the other side...`
`Kanon's face was filled with agony,`
` ......but in this very moment,`
` he had won, without a doubt.`
`The demon stake he was gripping with his right hand turned back into Lucifer again...`
`Kanon was now gripping exactly where her neck was.`
`".........Ga,`
` ............gu,`
` ..................h..."`
`"...I win.`
` .........{f:5:Beatrice}."`
`Kanon didn't hold back at all with the hand gripping Lucifer's throat.`
`......She had challenged him again after their fight had already been decided.`
`{n}Kanon had no obligation to be considerate.`
`But even so, Kanon released the witch's furniture.`
`......Was it his naive humanism, his pity for another piece of furniture,`
` or a final show of respect to the witch?`
`In any case, when she was released, Lucifer fell face‐down on the ground,`
` and made as if to vomit, moaning over the pain in her throat...`
`"Spectacular, Kanon.`
` ......Your great efforts have gone some way to proving Kinzo's research correct."`
`Ronove was clapping his hands.`
`...To Kanon, who had achieved a difficult victory, incurring a wound on his left hand that couldn't be closed, that applause seemed nothing but shallow.`
`"......All possibilities are hidden in the human heart, was it?`
` .........My, my, this is why humans are frightening!`
` Well done, Kanon.`
` You are victorious.`
` Spectacular!"`
`"......Haah,`
` ......haah,`
` ......haah......"`
`"Are you okay?!`
` Kanon‐kun......"`
`Shannon ran up to him and wrapped a handkerchief around his left hand, which was still spraying blood.`
`"That was spectacular, Kanon!`
` Truly spectacular.`
` I was also slightly hoping for an upset.`
` How truly wonderful you are as furniture not to let me down.`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` I think better of you now.`
` I honestly think better of you!"`
`"Y‐......you better not have forgotten our promise...`
` {f:5:Beatrice}..."`
`"Mhm.`
` Of course I have not forgotten.`
` Witches and demons are admittedly unjust.`
` However, we are much more noble than humans when it comes to our contracts."`
`"I will not go back on my word.`
` I guaranteed that if you won,`
` I would give you the right to decide the five people who will escape becoming the 13 sacrifices."`
`"......B‐{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` I haven't yet...lo—`
`higi!!"`
`{f:5:Beatrice} twirled her pipe, and heaven and earth turned over just for Lucifer.`
`......So as a horribly natural result, she "fell" onto the ceiling.`
`The ceiling doesn't seem that high to people standing on the floor.`
`{n}...However, people who fall on it upside‐down and head‐first surely don't feel the same way...`
`"Milady.`
` Isn't this a little much?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` That may be so.`
` I suppose I will forgive her."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} spun her pipe again.`
`When she did, the magic that had been affecting Lucifer was released.`
`......So as a horribly natural result, this time with extreme legitimacy, she "fell" back onto the floor.`
`"Agah......!!"`
`"............Ku,`
` ............u,`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama,`
` ...f‐...forgive me............"`
`"What are you afraid of?`
` I have already forgiven you, haven't I?`
` *cackle*!`
` So, Kanon.`
` Shall we continue?"`
`".........Continue what?`
` ...You aren't saying that you want me to finish her, are you...?!"`
`"Ah, no, no.`
` It isn't over yet, right?"`
`".........What isn't?`
` ...Stop dodging the question...!!"`
`"I did promise you, didn't I?`
` If you could defeat my furniture, of {i:the Seven Stakes of Purgatory}, riiiiiiight?`
` Come, arise, Seven Stakes of Purgatory.`
` The six younger sisters of the worthless elder sister!"`
`""""""Kyahhahahahahahahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha!!""""""`
`With shrill laughing voices, the air split,`
` and gold sprayed everywhere as the remaining six of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory showed themselves...`
`All of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, only one of which Kanon had been able to defeat by sacrificing his left arm, were gathered...`
`By now, Kanon regretted his thoughtlessness in accepting the witch's challenge.`
`{n}...He had been foolish to assume that a game with a witch would be on an even footing......!`
`"............Laaame‐o.`
` Onee‐sama, why are you crawling on the floor?"`
`"Y‐...you people...............`
`gh......"`
`"See, this is why Onee‐sama's useless.`
` Even though she acts like she's so great as the oldest sister, that's just on the outside."`
`"Yeah, seriously!`
` Lucifer onee‐sama, your disgraceful behavior will damage others' opinions about all of us!`
` Know your shame!`
` You novice!"`
`"............Ku, .........gu......"`
`"Kanon‐ku~n, awesome awesome.`
` But don't get cocky, okay?`
` Lucifer onee‐sama just brags all the time, she's no big deal compared to the rest of us sisters."`
`"...That's why I'm always saying Lucifer‐nee shouldn't do anything.`
` It's alright if she just brags all the time.`
` Because we superior ones always have to clean up the fighting scenes."`
`"What are you gonna do, Onee‐sama?`
` We respect your pride,`
` so we were planning on letting you challenge him again in that beaten‐up body without getting in the way..."`
`"......But Kanon‐kun sure is strong, right?`
` Right now, no matter how much you struggle, there's no way you can win, right...?"`
`"......Y‐`
`.........you peopleee............"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` My, my, you sisters are always so lively.`
` Is now really the time for discord?"`
`"Being a 7‐person unit is what makes you the Seven Sisters of Purgatory.`
` Now play nice and execute the task I gave you.`
` Swiftly, alright?"`
`"Come on, Lucifer onee‐sama.`
` If you want to borrow the power of your little sisters...`
` Say it, okay?`
` We want to hear you ask us for help from your own mouth."`
`"Kh, ............you plan to mock me even more.........?!"`
`"‘I, the foolish—`
`weak—`
`ugly—`
`shaaameful!—`
`eldest sister Lucifer, beg my younger sisters to save me’.`
` ......C'mon, let's hear it.`
` If you let us hear that, we'll save you.`
` That's a deal, right?`
` Everyone?!"`
`"......You.........`
`...b‐`
`......bitcheees......"`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory taunted their elder sister, calling her worthless.`
` Verbally abusing her.`
`...Even Kanon, who had been fighting her for his life until a second ago, couldn't bear to look straight at it...`
`"A‐as i—`
`......as if I...`
`...could say...`
`...something like that......"`
`"Do it quickly.`
` Obviously we won't get anywhere with you alone.`
` Hurry up and slay Kanon as the Seven Sisters."`
`"Pu ku ku ku...`
` Oh, what could be wrong, Lucifer?`
` It is an order from Milady, you know?"`
`"............How cruel."`
`Lucifer ground her teeth over and over, hurled curses at her sisters, and then,`
` ...............as she trembled all over,`
` ......she answered her sisters' request...`
`"...I, ............I, the foolish,`
` ......weak,`
` .........ugly...`
` ...uuuu...!"`
`"Shaaaameful!!"`
`"Sh‐...shameful,`
` ......eldest sister Lucifer,`
` ......beg...`
` .........uuuuuuuughhuhu!!`
` Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...!!"`
`She was finally unable to endure saying those degrading words,`
` ...and the girl bearing the name of Pride broke down crying.`
`However, the six younger sisters kept giggling coldheartedly.`
`"Heyyyy!`
` Don't try to trick us by crying!`
` You haven't finished saying iiiit!"`
`"That should be enough.`
` Come, sisters, let us display our power."`
`"I won't be satisfied until I hear the whole thing, you know?!`
` C'mon, c'mon, Onee‐sama, keep going!"`
`"That's enough!`
` Come on, this shame has been brought upon all of us sisters!`
` We won't let them return alive!"`
`"Alright, how should we play with this pitiful furniture?`
` Any wonderful suggestiooons?"`
`"Meee, me!`
` Beelze thiiinks...the seven of us shouuuld...get along and split Kanon up between us!"`
`"Good plan.`
` ......That way all of the sisters can get along."`
`"Then I'll take the head!`
` All of you can have the limbs!!"`
`"No no, noooooooooooo!!`
` {i:I} get the heaaaad!!"`
`"You know there's no way there'll be any meaning to promises like that!`
` It's obviously gonna be first one there wins!"`
`"Kuhihihihi!!`
` Kanon‐kun, if you have a suggestion for how you'd like to be killed, just tell us, okay?`
` We Seven Sisters will kill you in an awwwwesome way!"`
`"...........................Damn......"`
`"......Aaarrrrrrgggh!!`
` You've shamed me so much!!`
` Even slicing you into eight pieces won't be enough!!`
` I'll slice you into a hundred pieces!!`
` Here we go, everyone!!"`
`""""""Yeees, Onee‐sama!`
` Kyahhahahahahahaha!!""""""`
`The seven of them burst at once.`
`{n}They had no desire to play or boast.`
`{n}This time, they would genuinely follow their master's order.`
`...Slay Kanon. Swiftly!`
`The Seven Sisters jumped around the room faster than the eye could see, deciding how they would kill Kanon.`
`They tortured Kanon with their cruel giggles, sometimes making a close pass at him.`
`...They kept scraping his arms, shoulders, and cheeks,`
` carving red lines into his body...`
`At that time, Shannon dashed up behind him, holding on to him so that she blocked the way to his body at least a little.`
`"{nobreak:{m:-5:—}—}Kh......!!"`
`"Ah......?!"`
`At the same time, a red cylinder wrapped around the two of them, like a beam of light sent from heaven.`
` That cylinder repelled the evil ones who tormented Kanon...`
`"Whaaaat!!`
` That's cheeatiiing!`
` This has nothing to do with youuu!"`
`"Oh, I know what this is.`
` She must want to play with us."`
`"Kyahha!`
` Then I'll take her!`
` Aaall mine!!"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` May we have Shannon as our prey...?"`
`"Hm?`
` Aah, I don't mind, do as you like.`
` It seems Kanon alone won't be enough to satisfy your gluttony."`
`"I am so very grateful.`
` Come on, I'll make you regret coming out uninvited!"`
`"I'll turn you to scraps of meat so shredded you can't even tell who's who,`
` mix you and mix you and mince you into hamburgers!"`
`"Idiot, breaking that barrier comes first!`
` Do your job before you start worrying about food!"`
`""""Yees, Onee‐sama!!""""`
`"Gu......uuu......!!"`
`As a horribly natural first action, the Seven Sisters began to destroy the barrier Shannon had created.`
`...Shannon's barrier certainly was extremely strong.`
`{n}It was enough power to impress even {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`...It was strong enough that frail furniture would turn to dust just by touching it,`
` and it was firm, like a tree with deep roots.`
`But no matter how big a tree gets, it will eventually surrender to a saw or a hatchet.`
`{n}For the Seven Sisters, "chopping down" Shannon's barrier, while it was a pain, was not impossible.`
`"Hnf......!!"`
`The sound, like beetles jumping around, grew even more fierce and filled the room.`
`They cut up and steadily eroded away that red barrier, as though with a hatchet, a saw, no, a chainsaw by now...`
`"............How foolish.`
` You must have known that your barrier can't fully protect you from these girls.`
` Why...?"`
`".........Because I can't just let it happen."`
`Shannon spoke back resolutely as she covered Kanon, who was already spent of all his energy and sprawled on the floor.`
`"If you hadn't barged in uninvited, I would have given you a sleeplike death.`
` Why have you deliberately exposed yourself to the Seven Sisters?"`
`"......All death is not equal, you know?`
` You realize an intense death tortures you even after you die?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"............Go ahead, do as you like.`
` Just like you do as you want, I have done as I wanted."`
`"........................`
` ......Hmmmm.`
` Somehow, you simply lack entertainment value recently, you know?`
` The most interesting part about love is during the time when it's uncertain whether or not you will achieve it."`
`"After achieving it, a woman is like salmon who has finished laying its eggs.`
` I have already tired of you."`
`"Thank you.`
` No words I could hear from a witch would make me happier."`
`"......Hehehehhihihahaha.`
` Then, at least in the end, show me a way of dying that will please me greatly."`
`"Seven Sisters, did you hear that?!`
` Show me the limits of your brutality in the way you kill Shannon!!"`
`"...............Shannon..."`
`"......My apologies.`
` In the end, I wasn't able to match up to your greatness, Genji‐sama."`
`".........You're an idiot, Nee‐san...`
` If you'd just left me be, ...then you might not have met this horrible..."`
`"No, it's alright.`
` ...I was able to receive the ring from George‐sama, and live as a woman.`
` I was able to protect you, and live as a sister.`
` With this, my life is settled with no regrets."`
`"......Nnnngggggaaaaaaaaahhhh, you're pissing me off.`
` That philosophic view is really irritating!!`
` This is why you're furniture you don't even smell like a humaaaaaan!!"`
`"Look at {i:me}, {i:I} am human!!`
` Don't spout off philosophical stuff like you're more complete than I am, you furnituuuuuuuuuuure!!"`
`"............How ugly.`
` Is that regret your true form?"`
`"It's not a regreeeeeet, this is called LIVING!!`
` You received a ring, so it's alright if you die, what?!`
` Aaaaah, I can't understand it, not a clue not a hope, goddamn astonished, goddamn shocked, no goddamn good at aa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aalll!!"`
`"......Milady, I might suggest you are acting somewhat undignified."`
`"Shut up, furniture!!`
` Shannooooonn, do you think I'll let you die easilyyyyyyyyyyy?!`
` Now's the time to bite your tooooooongue!!"`
`"............How pitiful.`
` If you can see yourself reflected in my eyes,`
` then shudder at your own ugliness."`
`"Don't worry,`
` I'll crush you mush you mash you up so you're even uglier, while you're still aliii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiive!!!"`
`At that time, .........Genji softly entered the red barrier.`
`{n}Maybe that barrier didn't block those without ill intent.`
`Then Genji...softly held Shannon from behind,`
` ......and covered her eyes with his right hand.`
`"............Genji‐sama..."`
`"You have done enough now...`
` .........Go to sleep before me."`
`"............Yes.`
` .........Thank you very much, Genji‐sama..."`
`".........Mhm."`
`After that, Genji softly pressed his left hand against the area around her collarbone...`
`......As he did, from the area where that left hand pressed,`
` ......a crimson stain gently spread out.`
`When Genji removed his hand,`
` .........bright‐red fresh blood oozed out of there.`
`For just the very first instant, it appeared to be shaped like a crimson rose...`
`And when he removed the right hand that covered Shannon's eyes,`
` .........there was a peaceful expression on her face, as though she was sleeping.`
`......And she fell softly,`
` ...silently down,`
` .........and slept.`
`Her soul had already been sent to a world where the malicious witch and her furniture could never reach her,`
` no matter how evilly they tortured her...`
`{f:5:Beatrice} and the Seven Sisters were shocked by this scene.`
`{n}...Only Ronove had a mysterious expression along with his smile.`
`Then Genji leaned over Kanon, who was crouching on the floor.`
`".........You did well.`
` You, too, should sleep now."`
`".................................`
` ............Yes.`
` Thank you very much, Genji‐sama."`
`Just as he had done with Shannon, after gently covering Kanon's eyes with his hand,`
` Genji gently covered the area around Kanon's collarbone with his other hand.`
`......And when that was removed with the lightness of a feather,`
` ...there was a crimson rose shape.`
`But that rose shape quickly turned into the stain of bright‐red blood pouring out...`
`"Wh‐`
`............what is...that......"`
`"......What a boring person.`
` ...The fun of a balloon of life is in poking it with a needle and making it forcefully explode."`
`"Spectacular, Genji.`
` ............You truly are furniture."`
`"......Thank you very much.`
` ...Well then, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, Ronove‐sama.`
` With this as my final task, allow me to rest."`
`"............Grr.`
` You took what I was playing with.`
` All of that thrashing and mashing I wanted to do to them,`
` I hope you're willing to take all that instead??"`
`{f:5:Beatrice} faced him with an unsatisfied expression,`
` but Ronove spoke quietly to Genji with a soothing smile.`
`"You have worked hard.`
` You are my greatest servant.`
` ......I shall bestow as a final gift to you a peaceful sleep worthy of all your labors until now."`
`"Wha?!`
` Wait, what are you...!"`
`When Ronove snapped his fingers,`
` ......as if Genji was a puppet that had crumpled from its strings being cut,`
` ...suddenly, and yet gently...`
`He fell, sprawled on the floor, into a sleep that witches couldn't call him back from...`
`That was as filled with kindness as the sleep he had given Shannon and Kanon...`
`"......What was that, Ronove?`
` ......What a boring anticlimax."`
`"Are you not a powerful Great Witch, Milady?`
` Something such as this is not enough to pay attention to.`
` ......It is not like you to allow the blood to rush to your head because of provocation from someone like Shannon."`
`"...........................`
` ...hmph."`
`What was there that {f:5:Beatrice} didn't like?`
`{n}...Was she still unable to remove the thorn of Shannon's words?`
`Ronove laughed lightly, as though lamenting the complexity of the human and the female heart, and ordered the Seven Sisters to go.`
`......After all, there were still two sacrifices left for the first twilight.`
`The Seven Sisters cavorted as they disappeared...`
`Gohda was doing the nighttime rounds.`
`There had never been anything on Rokkenjima outside the Ushiromiya family.`
`{n}So checking that the doors and windows were all closed had no real purpose.`
`However, ever since Natsuhi had scolded them saying that this was careless, the nighttime rounds had become part of the servants' daily routine.`
`......The reason that Natsuhi had ordered this was the occasional disturbances of the witch.`
`Everyone who visited this island knew about the legend of {f:5:Beatrice}, the witch of the forest.`
` This had become established as this island's characteristic ghost story.`
`Because of that, it was only natural that some people would occasionally say that, when they thought they were alone in the mansion,`
` ...they had heard strange sounds, or seen the shadow of a person.`
`However, when that had created a little too big of a disturbance and reached Natsuhi's ears,`
` she had made a fuss, thinking that some suspicious person might have been coming in and out.`
`Apparently, it was said that she had roused all of the servants and had them check throughout the mansion.`
`Because all of this uproar over the witch had happened before Gohda had come,`
` he had only heard about it from the more senior servants.`
`Ghost stories like that could be found in any workplace.`
` Even at the hotel Gohda had once worked at, and at the restaurant,`
` there was never a shortage of those types of story.`
`So when he heard that story on this island,`
` he smiled bitterly, thinking "ah, so they have that kind of thing here after all".`
`He smiled bitterly, but he thought when in Rome, do as the Romans do, and had not slighted that.`
`Gohda went along with it on the outside, but in his heart he thought it was a childish trick.`
` ......At first.`
`"............This certainly is eerie.`
` I see, I understand why the servants got in an uproar over this in the past."`
`He could understand that if someone, doing the rounds on an eerie night like this,`
` saw a lace curtain waving in the breeze from a window which hadn't been closed,`
` they might be tempted to believe they had seen a ghost.`
`"So there's a curse if you make fun of the witch of the portrait, huh.`
` ......Seems like there were servants who got hurt really bad and quit, too.`
` ...I'd hate to be injured.`
` I'm already this old.`
` Doubt I'll ever be blessed with a workplace this hospitable again...`
` Aaah.`
` Great witch of the portrait.`
` I'm really gonna work hard here, so please go easy on me."`
`Gohda prayed to the portrait, his hands together, as though he was at a Shinto shrine...`
`At that time, ...he thought he heard a sound.`
`The kitchen?`
` Was that the sound of something metal falling on the floor?`
`Surely a mouse or a cockroach hadn't come out, and knocked over some of the dishes...`
` No, no, how could that be.`
` It was routinely and thoroughly cleaned!`
`Gohda thought that in any case he had better check what that noise had been, and entered the kitchen.`
`He turned on the kitchen light.`
`{n}......When he did, he heard a strange sound.`
`Clankclankclankclankclankclank.`
`......To a cook like Gohda, that sound seemed like the lid on the pressure cooker or something was shaking.`
`Of course, it couldn't be in use when no one was in the kitchen.`
`{n}If someone {i:had} been using the gas, what a dangerous thing to do, to just walk away from it.`
`...Just in case, Gohda decided to inspect the area around the gas range...`
`"...............What is this...?"`
`When he did, in the corner by the gas range,`
` ...the pressure cooker really had been placed there, just as he had thought.`
`But the flame wasn't on.`
`{n}...And yet, the lid was clanking...`
`Was something fermenting and leaking gas?`
`{n}...How could that be?`
` ......Then was there a mouse or something inside?`
`{n}...How could there be, ridiculous...`
`In front of people, Gohda acted as though he had a bold personality fitting for his build,`
` ......but he actually had an unexpectedly timid side to him.`
`He was terrified to find out what might be inside, and he couldn't check it carelessly...`
`In his cowardice, ...he grabbed a nearby wooden pestle,`
` and with a {i:clunk!},`
` he tapped it a little strongly against the side of the pressure cooker.`
`When he did, the clanking sound suddenly stopped.`
`...He should have been relieved now that it had stopped,`
` ...but the fact that it had stopped when he had hit it was even more eerie, and made him even more suspicious about what was inside...`
`"............nn, ...*gulp*.`
` .........Strange phenomena do not exist in this world, no sirree.`
` Yes, there's no such thing as witches, or magic, things like that can't possibly exist.`
` All phenomena can be explained with science.`
` ......As though monsters and witches could exist...!"`
`He repeated that many times, trying to build up his own confidence.`
` ...It was quite comical how he looked completely different from what he was saying.`
`"Who would believe in a witch, who would believe in magic or curses...`
` ......Come on,`
` ......show me what you really are...!`
` Take that!"`
`......He removed the lid of the pressure cooker.`
`And lying exposed there...`
`was the sparkling clean silver bottom of the pot.`
`......There was absolutely nothing frightening like he had imagined.`
`"...............Whew.`
` ...Hahahaha, well, of course.`
` ...There's no way there could have been anything inside."`
`By now, Gohda realized that he had been a coward.`
`......So while he still had some doubts about what had caused the lid to make that sound,`
` ...he explained it away abstractly as some quirk of positioning or something, and decided not to worry about it too much.`
`Then he took the lid he had grabbed, ......and softly set it back down where it had been.`
`......It's alright, there won't be a sound.`
` ......Obviously.`
`{n}As if witches or magic could exist...!`
`Clank.`
` Clankclankclankclank.`
`"...............Huh...?"`
`Clank{0}clank{0}clank{0}clank{0}clank{0}clank{0}clank{0}clank.`
`CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK!`
`"Hii, ......HIIIiiiIIIIii!!"`
`All of the pots and utensils in the kitchen started clanking at once.`
`And it grew stronger still, until finally, it became so strong that the lid to one of the pots fell off...!`
`And, ......from inside that pot, .........a slender white arm slowly streeeetched out.`
`The lid fell off another pot, and another hand slowly streeeetched out,`
` and anotherrrr,`
` and anotherrrr...`
`"Hiiiiiiiii!!!`
` Witches aren't, witches can't be reeeeeal!!`
` I'll never believe iiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`When the number of arms grew to seven, a loud, shrill laughter split the air.`
`"What a letdown!`
` It's a reeeeal letdown that a person who can make such delicious food is such a lightweight!!"`
`"If you don't need him, I'll take him, he's all mine!!"`
`"Wait, I said nooooooooooo!!`
` I'm gonna take him!!"`
`"Huh?!`
` Wha, whaa?!?!`
` HYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!"`
`""""Kyahahahahahahaha!!!""""`
`Come on, let's search, there's only one more.`
`{n}That old hag!`
` Where is she?`
`{n}Not the mansion, maybe the guesthouse?`
`Kuhihihihi, you snooze you lose, right, you snooze you lose, right?!`
`Come on, search search, find her find her...!`
`Don't get noticed by the relatives in the dining hall?`
`Don't get noticed by the kids in the guesthouse?`
`Search in silence, kill in silence!`
`{n}After all, it's still just the first twilight!`
`She isn't in the guesthouse.`
`{n}But she wasn't in the mansion either?`
`Hey hey, I found her, I found her, she's in the rose garden.`
`{n}Why's she standing around there without an umbrella?`
`She's given herself up, all mine all mine all miiine!`
`{n}You slowpokes can just sit there and watch!`
`I told you, nooooooo, this one's miiiiiiiiiiiiine!!`
`Come on, if we take any longer we'll be scolded by {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama!`
` Let's take care of it all at once!`
`"......................................."`
`Come on, found her, surrounded her!`
` Come on, let's get along and do it all at once, okay?!`
` Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiie!!!`
`".........Eeeh...?`
` .........Huh?"`
`"Wh‐`
`......what is...`
`...this..."`
`"............Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` What naughty girls.`
` ...Could you be friends of that child...?"`
`"...What is with this............o‐old hag...?!"`
`"There's got to be some mistake!!`
` One more time!!"`
`"......Why can she defend against us?!"`
`"Move aside!`
` One more time!!!"`
`"............No matter how often you try, it's useless.`
` This person...is good."`
`"...............I am waiting for that child.`
` Would you mind calling for her?"`
`"D‐do you think we'd be apprenticed to you like that?!"`
`"There's no need."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...!"`
`"............It was sufficient for even myself to manifest.`
` ...I was sure that you would awaken."`
`"Ronove.`
` It has been a long time.`
` ......Yes, it truly has been a long time."`
`"This woman, she didn't use "sama" for his name......!"`
`"..................And...`
`it has been a long time for us also.`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"Sh‐she's not even using "sama" for {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama..."`
`"Enough.`
` Do you know who this person is?`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice} was originally this person's name.`
` I merely inherited that name from her.`
` ......This person is my master.`
` The Predecessor Lady {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"The Predecessor...`
`...Lady {f:5:Beatrice}......"`
`Gold butterflies appeared in ones and twos from the garden of roses and began to gather around Kumasawa...`
`And after becoming a golden radiance and enveloping her, they burst and disappeared—and Kumasawa's form was no longer there.`
`...Instead, there was another Golden Witch, .........the one who had, in the past, explained to {f:5:Beatrice} the path of an Endless Witch,`
` the only person {f:5:Beatrice} had called Master in her entire life.`
`Her hair was long, beautiful, and vividly youthful,`
` and her figure in that elegant dress was unrecognizable as an old lady...`
`No, this looked like a completely different person than Kumasawa.`
`".........Well, well, Master.`
` I never even dreamed the day would come that we would meet each other again."`
`"Yes, me too.`
` ...Certainly, I never even dreamed that my sleep would be disturbed."`
`"Such a troublesome time for you to awaken.`
` ......If you remained sleeping as usual, the first twilight could be finished without much trouble."`
`"...Or should I welcome you?`
` ............I was just a little bored."`
`"......Just as usual, it seems you are toying with sinless people in a vulgar game.`
` ......I believe I have taught you many times that the power of the Endless Witch must not be used to cause people trouble."`
`"Don't say that, Master.`
` Isn't boredom our natural enemy?`
` This is just a little spice to escape from that."`
`".........Tch.`
` The more the corrosion advances, the stronger my power becomes, and the easier it becomes to call my minions.`
` ...But who would have thought it would release the seal on you, Master, at the same time..."`
`"It was because I predicted that,`
` that I slept very close to you like this.`
` ......As I prayed in my sleep that I would not be woken again.`
` ...Being reunited with you like this is a very sad thing for me."`
`"..................You're as cunning as always, Master...`
` *cackle*..."`
`"Ronove.`
` Have the furniture children step back.`
` Furniture merely serves its master.`
` The master is responsible for all of her crimes."`
`".........Certainly.`
` Madam {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"I have already surrendered that name to this child.`
` ......Come now, step back.`
` Furniture girls.`
` ......For those who do not listen the first time, I say it a second.`
` However, I do not speak it a third..."`
`"......Step back, Seven Sisters of Purgatory.`
` If you get involved, you will be turned to dust..."`
`"B‐......back, everyone..."`
`Ronove and the Seven Sisters of Purgatory retreated.`
`After that, there was the {f:5:Beatrice} whose bold expression didn't falter,`
` and the master {f:5:Beatrice}, who had given up that name, and wore a composed smile...`
`"Well then.`
` ......Master.`
` What tea shall I prepare for our long awaited reunion?"`
`"Let's see.`
` This reunion was longer in coming than the visit of a comet.`
` I will accept your hospitality.`
` .........If there appear to be any issues, then my name and the title of Endless Witch,`
` ......I will have them returned, understand?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` So there's even a license renewal policy for the title of Endless Witch?"`
`"......As you say, Master.`
` See how splendid your disciple has become,`
` and see how far she has surpassed what you were long ago...!"`
`It looked like sparks exploded in the air between the two {f:5:Beatrice}s.`
`Just by glaring at each other, they purged all spirits from that space.`
`...As they watched, the Seven Sisters shivered.`
` ...Because if they had retreated just three steps less than they had, they would already have been turned to dust by now.`
`"So, come.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...Surrendering my name to you is the only regret I have in my life.`
` I will now correct that error with my own hands!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...`
` ...Tut tut tut.`
` ......That's wrong, Masterrr.`
` My only error...`
`was becoming your disciple to learn this trifling level of power, got thaaaat?"`
`"You call this magic?`
` You call this being an Endless Witch?`
` ......The power to notice, that's all it waaas!`
` And you made suuuch a big deal of it.`
` Your time is long past, Masteee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeer!!"`
`".........I,`
` ......I, I don't have a clue what's going on anymore......!`
` What in the world is happening right in front of my eyes...!"`
`"......Poor thing.`
` It seems my disciple is causing you trouble.`
` I apologize."`
`"Y‐...you... Who are you?`
` Why did Kumasawa baa‐chan turn into an attractive lady like this?!`
` I mean, who are you?!`
` I don't get it?!`
` What kind of special effects are these?!`
` My head feels like it's gonna explode!!"`
`"I am the witch master of that child.`
` My old name was {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` When she succeeded me, I gave her that name, so I do not have a name."`
`"You already said it, but your disciple's being a real pain to me!`
` Please, take responsibility and do something!`
` No, wait!!"`
`"I don't believe in stuff like this!!`
` As if witches and magic are real!!`
` I won't accept this messed‐up battle!`
` Damn it all to hell, what am I supposed to believe?!!"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` Just like you, hospitality with a very quick temper."`
`"...*cackle*cackle*.`
` I'd expect nothing less from you, Master.`
` It looks like this level of magic is so insignificant to you, you can't even be bothered to open your eyes...!"`
`"Looks like it'll be impossible unless I'm prepared to wreck the whole island, riiiiiight?`
` Come, arise, Shoulder War Towers!!"`
`In response to {f:5:Beatrice}'s summons, a terrific earth tremor split the rose garden.`
`And on either side of her shoulders, two massive War Towers sprouted and stabbed into the heavens.`
` They stretched 100 {c:86Ef9C:merute} tall, and each one had over 360 ports.`
`They were War Towers of the gods' army corps, which had not allowed the heroes of antiquity to invade their precincts, even as they banded together.`
`As {f:5:Beatrice} elegantly floated in the gap between the massive two‐headed towers, she looked down on her master, sneering with an absolute superiority.`
`With the two massive towers lined up behind her shoulders, the witch looked very small,`
` like a butterfly dancing between large trees.`
`"Hihhyahhyahhyaaaaaa!!`
` Don't think you can dodge it by turning into butterflies, alright?`
` The density of the twin towers' barrage wouldn't just make you a pinned bug collection, it'd make you a madly stabbed pincushion, get it...?"`
`The towers' more than 720 ports opened, and godly soldiers readied their multi‐shot ballistas.`
`"Does that conclude your turn?"`
`"Heh, {i:those} are your last words?!!`
` OPEN FIII{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}IIIRE!!!"`
`Ballista shots numbering easily over a thousand were all fired at once, drawing a beautiful geometric curtain of death.`
`The boorish sound performed by those bowstrings was probably even deeper than the sound of Death swinging his scythe.`
`"Come, arise, Fallen Tower.`
` Split the single language, and make known the sin."`
`The sky was stained an incandescent red, and from between the clouds, a blazing, massive tower fell upside down.`
`That massive falling tower and its rubble...`
`swallowed the thousands of ballista shots, so that not one of them could approach the body of the witch who had summoned it.`
`Yes, none can approach the mysteries of heaven.`
`{n}That was the truth of the Fallen Tower.`
`"As I would expect from you, Master!`
` If you do something, you always do it big!!`
` Kuhhuhu{0}hu{0}huhya{0}hyahya!!"`
`"My turn isn't over.`
` Come, arise, Sons of Ivaldi.`
` Bestow upon me a worthy spear!"`
`As the massive crimson tower that had fallen made a mighty gold‐colored explosion,`
` from inside those flames, a spear showed itself, of such massive proportions that you had to look up to see all of it, much like a tower.`
`...It was too large for even a giant's hand.`
`It was a divinely beautiful spear of the gods, so massive that it gave the illusion that the tower which had fallen had turned into a spear of the same size.`
` A spear of certain victory that no one could escape.`
`"It looks like your twin towers are useless.`
` How foolish that you blocked off your means of escape on both sides.`
` You can't defend against even a single spear!"`
`When she snapped her fingers in command,`
` the massive tower‐like spear shot at {f:5:Beatrice} like a lightning bolt.`
`As the Golden Witch danced in the gap between the towers like a butterfly,`
` it sliced straight through the air like a flash of lightning,`
` aiming right for the very middle of the absolute center of her heart, with the most ultimate and extreme precision.`
`"Hah!!`
` So, you use Gungnir in a place like this!!`
` You really are incredible, Masteeeerrrrr!!"`
`"Explode, useless towers!`
` Arise, Giant Soldier Battle Line.`
` Fully block that divine spear with your shields and chests!!"`
`The Shoulder War Towers exploded in gold.`
`{n}They became several billion gold butterflies.`
`Those butterflies took the shape of seven massive armored soldiers.`
`Each stretched a full 50 merute into the sky,`
` and they lined up in front of {f:5:Beatrice}, protecting their master and holding massive shields which towered like windmills.`
`Their massive size was evocative of a mountain range.`
` The witch hiding behind them was like a small moon hiding behind the mountains.`
`Once in the past, when the massive shields these giants held had been readied by the whole giants' regiment,`
` they had protected King Wilhelm's castle not only from arrows, but from the wind and the rain,`
` and when they had faced upwards and held their shields to the heavens, not a single raindrop had gotten through.`
`"Foolish.`
` How pitiful is the witch who has forgotten her respect for the divine.`
` Did you think that giants could defend against a spear of the gods?!"`
`"......Indeed.`
` No matter how much human metal you are armed with, you cannot block a spear of the gods.`
` A wonderful epaulette mate by Madam."`
`"No way?!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama!!"`
`"Of course I haven't forgotten, Master!`
` Come, arise, Hephaestus and his disciples.`
` Bestow upon me a worthy shieeeld!!"`
`A golden whirlwind arose at the feet of the Giant Soldiers.`
`{n}It was a group of countless butterflies.`
`...They attached themselves to the massive shields like gold leaf, sparkling like they were a gold mirror.`
`That was the absolute defensive wall that the King of the Gods gave to the goddess.`
`{n}The Aegis Shield.`
`When the holy spear, which left a dignified tail behind it like a comet, crashed into the mountain range of that gold shield,`
` there was a terrible thunderous roar.`
` It was the creaking of the pillars that held up the heavens.`
`The Divine Spear spun around and around, sent flying in the direction the sun sets.`
`"Impossible...`
` Sh‐she defended against the Divine Spear...!!"`
`"No, that is not correct.`
` The holy spear avoided the impact.`
` It is the law of the gods that an absolute spear and an absolute shield must not fight each other.`
` Although in the end, it means the same thing as defending against it."`
`"..................Churlish fighting appears to be the only area in which your skills have improved."`
`"Or rather, it seems that you are still as bad as ever at this kind of game, Master.`
` It's my turn to strike back.`
` I shall follow the code and counter a spear with a spear."`
`The Giant Soldier Battle Line, which had fully blocked the Divine Spear, released their holy gold shields.`
`The shields fell to the earth, making the ground shake.`
`And then another gold whirlwind arose,`
` and the seven gold shields changed their form into seven massive spears of lightning lying on the ground.`
`In unison, each of the giants lifted a leg high, and firmly stomped on the tips of the handles.`
`As the earth shook with a thunderous sound, the seven lightning spears spun beautifully and flew up above the Giant Soldiers' heads.`
`...They covered everywhere in a spray of gold as they began to fall before the giants.`
`Each of the giants squared off, and with the force of their whole body, they kicked and smashed them into pieces.`
`Those broken pieces numbered exactly 30 each, and became lightning spears of exactly the same size as the original,`
` which made 210 for all 7 of them; and all of those burst at once,`
` each splitting into 30 thorns, so that there were 6,300.`
`They became a thundercloud barrage, drawing out a beautiful geometric pattern,`
` and then each of those changed into three bolts of lightning, so that 18,900 thunderbolts shot at the Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`"It's oveeeeer!!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐samaaa!!"`
`"I would expect nothing less.`
` ......From Madam."`
`Certainly, a bundle of almost 20,000 thunderbolts should have reduced the master's body to dust.`
` But there was no impact.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} knew immediately that she had been fooled.`
`At that moment, from the direction the sun was supposed to set, she felt an impossible ray of sunlight.`
`A brilliant ray of light shone on her profile.`
`It was the figure of the master, holding aloft the spear of the gods that had supposedly been repelled a short while ago.`
`{n}...She bore a brilliant radiance like the sun on her back, and made it shine on the incarnation of darkness.`
`...{f:5:Beatrice}, watching from there,`
` was trapped like a mouse in a cage, cornered in a dead‐end formed by the Giant Soldier Battle Line.`
`By now, the Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice} had seized a position directly alongside the Giant Soldier Battle Line.`
`"Now we are done playing, {f:5:Beatrice}...!"`
`".........H‐have I...`
`exposed my flaaaaank......?!"`
`Her bold expression hadn't faltered once before now, but now it twisted for the first time.`
`And faster than {f:5:Beatrice} could click her tongue, the Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice} released the holy spear.`
`In mid‐air, it sprung up into the air once more, and changed its form once again.`
`"Come, arise, Dvergar brothers.`
` Bestow upon me the giant‐smashing Iron Hammer of Heaven!"`
`"Giant Soldiers, protect me!!!`
` What are you doing, you slowpokes!!!"`
`By now it was no longer a spear, but the whirlwind of a massive hammer that raised a sound like a windstorm as it flew through the air.`
`It was the legendary hammer that had shaken the King of the Frost Giants.`
`{n}So the Giant Soldiers couldn't escape from that fear.`
`So no matter how much their master ordered them, they couldn't block the path of that hammer.`
`"Back rank mate!`
` Rest in peace."`
`"...Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit.........!!!"`
`Before the whirlwind of this massive chunk of metal, {f:5:Beatrice} was nothing more than a mere speck.`
`The instant the whirlwind started to suck {f:5:Beatrice} in, {f:5:Beatrice}'s form turned into a massive War Tower.`
`The Iron Hammer smashed the War Tower, scattered tremendous amounts of rubble, but it did not reach she who had escaped behind it.`
`Furthermore, when the smoke started to settle, the War Tower had sucked in the massive Iron Hammer without crumbling, and blocked the way.`
`Even the giant‐smashing Iron Hammer couldn't break through the final tower protecting the witch.`
`However, this War Tower was in fact the witch's last trump card.`
`{n}It was a War Tower for dodging that could only save her from danger once.`
`But this tower was impregnable.`
` No weapon could break through it.`
`Just then, the moon disappeared.`
` As {f:5:Beatrice} hid in the shadows of the Giant Soldier Battle Line and the War Tower, she looked up at the sky.`
`When she did, inside the moon was the figure of a massive horse ridden by the god of war and death.`
`The Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice} rode the horse with him.`
`His cloak had blocked the moon and swallowed it in an eerie shadow.`
`{n}And the spear of the gods was in his hand once more...`
`It was, in other words, a godly knight who had jumped over the ramparts formed by the Giant Soldiers and the War Tower, attacking from the heavens.`
`"......*cackle*...`
` You got meee..."`
`"Smothered mate.`
` It was fun, {f:5:Beatrice}!"`
`"Uuuoooooo{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}oooo!!!"`
`The struggle to the death between the two witches with the same name...was resolved.`
`The spear that had been launched from the heavens pierced the ground.`
`The Giant Soldier Battle Line and the War Tower split up into countless gold butterflies, shrouding the area in a golden storm.`
`Then, the sound of thunder.`
` ......And the sound of the falling rain and wind.`
`Suddenly, that place was the empty rose garden once more.`
`{n}...The butler and the rest were watching the two witches confronting each other.`
`.........But only {f:5:Beatrice} was different.`
`She had been pierced straight through by the spear, from the base of her neck and her right shoulder, to her left buttock,`
` unable to even reach the ground with her feet,`
` ...horribly exposed like a pitiful pinned butterfly, tormented by the wind and rain...`
`".........B‐{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama..."`
`".....................`
` Truly...`
`she is a fearsome person."`
`"It is decided.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......Ku,`
` ......hihihihi,`
` ......ouch...h..."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} wore a bitter smile of false courage,`
` but a strand of blood dangled from her mouth, making her look even more pitiful.`
`"The title and power of the Endless Witch.`
` You will now return them to me along with the name {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...You are too immature to be called the Endless Witch."`
`"............Stop...`
` Forgive me, Master...`
` I was just fooling around, okay......?"`
`"I will take my name back from you.`
` I will return you to your original form.`
` Relinquish this power which is beyond you, and live a life suitable for yourself."`
`".........Come, try to remember.`
` What form did you have?"`
`The Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice} began to recite the words of power.`
`{n}When she did, small gold butterflies gathered around the skewered {f:5:Beatrice}, and began to swarm about her.`
`Like butterflies sucking the nectar out of flowers...`
`{n}...they began to suck the magical power out of {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`And it seemed that it caused her intense pain.`
`{n}A cry of agony escaped from {f:5:Beatrice}'s mouth.`
`She no longer had any power to resist it...`
`"Come, try closing your eyes.`
` Try to remember.`
` What form did you have?"`
`".........Come, {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` Repeat it with me.`
` Let us chant together.`
` Then it will be over in no time.`
` Let us end your pain as fast as possible."`
`"...Kuhihihi,`
` ......ha,`
` ...haha...`
` ......You're right...`
` How long has it been...`
`......since I chanted with you, Master......"`
`"Now, together.`
` .........Come, try to remember.`
` What form did you have?"`
`"......Come, try to remember.`
` What form did you have...?"`
`When the two of them began to recite the same chant,`
` more and more gold butterflies danced around, swarming around {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`".........It's alright, Milady.`
` You will lose the fact that you are my disciple,`
` but that will not change the fact that you are the lady I serve."`
`"...After that, I shall read a book for you again.`
` I shall bake you apple pies again.`
` Just like it was long ago.`
` ......Come, try to remember."`
`"......Hahahahahaha...`
` Yes, try to remember.`
` ...Are you finally starting to remember...?`
` ............Well, Master.`
` Did you remember...`
`...that thing behind yooou...?"`
`"...What is this...?`
` .................................This is..."`
`When the Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice} looked behind her,`
` ............there was a creepy hedgehog crouching there.`
`No.`
` ...It was...`
`...herself.`
`There was another Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice}, whose whole body was packed with ballista shots,`
` ......lying there like a pincushion doll...`
`"......Come, try to remember.`
` What form did you have?`
` ......No, I suppose that's wrong."`
`"......Come, try to remember.`
` How were you killed?`
` ......Kuhihihii, kuhya{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}hhaa{0}a{0}a{0}aaahh!!"`
`The Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice} was shocked.`
`...Instantly, her form began to grow faint...`
`"This......`
` ......When...did you............"`
`"In the beginning, I did not summon Shoulder Towers.`
` They were Quadruplet Towers.`
` Master, you nonchalantly stepped across the Seventh Rank Rook boundary of death created by the two hidden towers,`
` which were lurking in the distance on either side of you."`
`"......It was bad manners for me to say "check" so late.`
` Let me openly apologize.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The battle had been decided at the very beginning.`
` It had been over since the time the Predecessor had leaned forward, readying her holy spear to attack {f:5:Beatrice}, who had been wedged between her Shoulder Towers.`
`...The hidden towers lurking on either side had bathed her in a windstorm of ballista shots from 720 ports on both sides,`
` pinning and killing her.`
`However, {f:5:Beatrice} hadn't wanted it to be resolved with that.`
`{n}She had wanted to make her master take her next move, and had continued acting as though the game was still on.`
`She had immediately revived her with the Endless power,`
` ...and had made her continue the game as though nothing had happened...`
`Then the Predecessor slowly remembered that she had already been killed,`
` ......and began to completely erase her form.`
`When she did, the spear which had pierced {f:5:Beatrice} also erased itself.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} finally fell and landed on her feet.`
`{n}...There wasn't even a trace of a scar.`
`".........It was fun,`
` Master.`
` If you want to play again, I'll revive you any time.`
` And once we've had some fun, I'll make you remember that you were a corpse again."`
`"Okay?`
` I'm fully obeying what you taught me, you know...?`
` Didn't you say to always put a toy back in its box when you are done playing with it?`
` *cackle*cackle*, hahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"......Was it...an easy victory?"`
`"You fool, it was a difficult victory!!`
` ............If I hadn't tricked her with the Quadruplet Towers, I would have been the one to die!`
` ......As I would expect from my master.`
` .........But now I may feel proud."`
`"...Now, I have completely surpassed my master.`
` Ronove.`
` Make Master's remains a little better.`
` ......I haven't lost my respect for her that much."`
`"Certainly.`
` Tonight's first twilight became a little too riotous.`
` It will require some cleaning up.`
` It shall be handled immediately.`
` Goats, it is time to clean up."`
`When Ronove snapped his fingers, blazing, sparkling eyes began to blink open in the shadows and darkness,`
` becoming goat‐headed attendants, which appeared one after another, slowly out of the black.`
`One by one, they lined up behind Ronove's back, wordlessly standing at attention.`
`"What shall be done about the six bodies this time?`
` Another locked‐room format?"`
`"......I am not in a mood to think now.`
` I will leave it to you.`
` ...An extraordinary locked room to torment Battler, if you would."`
`"Certainly.`
` It shall be extraordinary."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*, hahhhahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!`
` Allllright, where is Battler?`
` Battleeeeer, did you watch my big momeeeeeeeeent??"`
`".........Damn iiiiiiiiit...`
` After being shown that screwed up magical storm, what can I deny?!"`
`"Do witches exist, I ask?!`
` After all those kabooms and kabangs,`
` after being shown all that tremendous fantasy, what can I deny now?!!`
` I don't get it anymore!`
` It was like that last time too, but how can I deny that awesome, wonderful magical battle?!"`
`"I knoo~w, rii~ght?!`
` After watching this, you can't talk your way out of it anymore, caaaan youuuuu???`
` Alright, Battler, let me hear some ridiculous reasoning, kuhhi{0}hhyah{0}hyahhya!`
` Uhhiehhiehhyaaahhh!!"`
`"Milady, your laugh is undignified."`
`"Oh, my apologies.`
` But I am not to blame."`
`"After all, when Battler tightly closes his eyes, grinds his teeth and shows me that ever‐so‐bitter expression,`
` it just automatically slips out of my mouth, you seeee...`
` Kuhhihihhyahhyahaah!!"`
`"Come, Battler‐sama.`
` Why don't you return to the table without losing heart?`
` Milady is expecting your counterattack, you see...?"`
`"Fuck you!!`
` How the hell can I make a counterargument?!"`
`"In the first place, this has all been fucked up since about the time that the tower sprouted up out of the earth!!`
` Should I say that, actually, underground on Rokkenjima, there's a secret laboratory for massive transforming combining robots or something,`
` and that by pushing a button, a strange tower sprouts up?!"`
`"Right, and then those huge giants must be robots,`
` or maybe an evil secret association's mecha‐monsters?!"`
`"It makes no goddamn sense!!`
` Don't talk to meeeeeeeeeee, uuo{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}oohhh!!!"`
`"C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon, don't cry, alright??`
` Kaboom, kabang, it's magic!!"`
`"If you want, I'll crush the moon and make comets fall like rain!`
` I can even bury the whole island in those bouncy‐chested babes you like so much, seeeeeeeeee??`
` Hihhihhihhihhi!!"`
`"Come come, look look look, my turn is over, seeeeeeeeee?!`
` Show me your response, counterattack!!`
` You can't, can yoooooouuu?`
` I'm a quadrillion percent sure that you can't!!`
` You're useless against this, riiiiiiiiiight?`
` You actually like this kind of fantasy, don't yooooouuu??"`
`"I know all about it, this kind of stuff's been going around everywhere lately hasn't it?!`
` In manga and light novels, in anime and movies!`
` Some teenage brat has a whole bunch of some strange special abilities, and there's all these kabooms and badooms with the fate of the world at risk!"`
`"You looove that too, don't you?!`
` I know, don't hide it, you love it, right, hiihyahhyahhyah!!`
` That thing that you love just displayed itself a little before your eyes, that's all, riiiiight?"`
`"Why do you believe it in manga and anime, but you won't believe in meeeeeeeeee??`
` Believe, believe, believe it!`
` You can't argue back, not after you've been shown something like this, riiiiiiiiiiiiight?"`
`"C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon, answer me,`
` you don't need to think, you can just obediently say "I'm sorry, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama"!"`
`"Come on come on try saying it, "I'm sorry, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama", try saying it, say it say it, don't be embarrassed,`
` kukikiki{0}kak{0}ka{0}ka{0}kah{0}hyah{0}hya{0}a{0}a{0}ah{0}ha{0}hha{0}hha{0}ha{0}hhha{0}hahhya{0}aahh!!"`
`There was no way to notice the coming of morning without opening a window and looking at the cloudy sky, which had become a tiny bit lighter.`
`It wasn't a refreshing morning.`
` All that could be heard was the sound of the rain, which had kept falling since last night, and the howl of the wind...`
`"......It's hard to imagine that it's morning.`
` This horrible weather reflects our hearts."`
`"Then I'd say it's pretty gentle, considering.`
` We should count ourselves lucky it's rain that's falling and not spears."`
`"Wahaha.`
` Whether it's rain or spears, bring it on, I say."`
`".........Is it already six o'clock?`
` Fuaaaaaa...`
` Isn't this enough?`
` Can't do much else until the mystery 19th person, {f:5:Beatrice}, takes action."`
`"That is correct.`
` ......However, I believe we have thought of almost every trick they could use against us."`
`"Yes.`
` As long as a traitor doesn't appear among us siblings, we should be able to deal with most situations."`
`"......Haven't we talked about this enough?`
` We ended up staying up all night.`
` ...I'm tired."`
`"You're right.`
` How about taking a little rest after eating breakfast?"`
`"...A good plan.`
` Staying up all night is trying at my age."`
`As they all stretched, they enjoyed this unrefreshing morning as best they could.`
`"Let's go wash our faces or something.`
` I probably look horrible."`
`"..................?`
` What is that horrible stench?"`
`As soon as they exited into the corridor, Kyrie made an openly disgusted expression.`
`"...What's the matter?"`
`"Hey, don't you smell something awful...?"`
`".........Hm.`
` ...What is this stench?`
` It's unbearable..."`
`Because of that fuss, everyone stuck their heads out into the corridor.`
`{n}...It was a faint stench, but after the complaints, they clearly noticed it.`
`Each of them went into the corridor, relying on their own sense of smell to tell them where this strange odor was coming from...`
`"What in the world could it be?`
` Let us have Genji deal with it.`
` I believe he should already have arrived in the servant room to begin the morning preparations."`
`"Mmhm, please.`
` It is difficult to imagine that Gohda, of all people,`
` could be making a breakfast that would cause this kind of stench..."`
`Rudolf's group searched for the source of the smell, and determined that it was coming from underground,`
` from the boiler room.`
`But the door was locked, and they couldn't check inside.`
`Meanwhile, Natsuhi's group were on their way to search for someone in the servant room, when they noticed something strange about the parlor.`
`"......What is this...?!"`
`"Wh‐what a horrible prank...`
` Who would do something like..."`
`Drawn on the door to the parlor, in a paint that reminded one of blood, there was a strange...`
`magic‐circle‐like thing.`
`"No one has come to the kitchen yet.`
` ......Wh‐what is...that?"`
`Eva's group, who had thought the smell had been coming from the kitchen,`
` had returned, having observed that no one was there and that preparations for breakfast had not yet begun.`
`......And they noticed the unusual state of the parlor.`
`"It's no good, the boiler room is locked.`
` Wouldn't it be bad if something's broken down in the boiler room?`
` Was there a servant anywhere around?"`
`".........!`
` Is that vulgar graffiti here too?`
` There was also one on the door to the boiler room."`
`"What's that?!`
` This creepy graffiti isn't just here, it's in other places as well?!`
` Haha, you don't think that this is the witch of the forest {f:5:Beatrice}'s declaration of war, right?"`
`Hideyoshi tried to make fun of it, but staring at this creepy magic circle while listening to the wind and rain really made it seem like it was a message from a witch.`
`...The dripping bright‐red paint made one think of blood, and it made things even more eerie.`
`Hideyoshi tried to open the door, but it was locked.`
`...As a general rule, the parlor was never locked.`
`{n}Someone had gone out of their way to lock it.`
`"......What does this mean...?`
` Did someone secretly leave this graffiti while we were talking in the dining hall?`
` On the doors to the parlor and the boiler room?"`
`"...I'm sure the servants are behind this.`
` We were together the whole time.`
` We all have alibis.`
` ......They probably did this prank on some strange orders from Father."`
`".........Considering the incident yesterday with Maria‐chan's letter,`
` it's more than possible to suspect that the servants are acting on Dad's orders and planning something.`
` ......Where the hell is everyone, anyway?`
` They can't be playing hide and seek.`
` Let's look for them."`
`"B‐...before that, I'm worried about the children.`
` They're alright, aren't they?`
` I'll go and check, and while I'm there, I'll see if there aren't any servants there."`
`"Then let's split up.`
` While you go to the guesthouse to see how the brats are doing, we'll check around inside the mansion.`
` .........I don't want to think about it,`
` but maybe these creepy magic circles aren't just where we've found them."`
`"......We might have become involved in a bizarre game of Father's.`
` ...I will go to him and ask about the situation.`
` ......Though I doubt he'll be good‐natured enough to listen to me."`
`The adults split up.`
`As a result, they confirmed that the four children were safe in the so‐called cousins' room, on the second floor of the guesthouse.`
`It appeared that they had stayed up late last night playing.`
`{n}All of them were snoring loudly, so Rosa decided not to wake them.`
`Furthermore, Nanjo, who had returned early the previous night to rest, was also alright.`
`{n}It seemed he believed in the phrase "early to bed, early to rise", and had awoken refreshed.`
`During that time, Kyrie and Hideyoshi searched for the servants.`
`{n}But they didn't find them.`
`...The servant room in the guesthouse was also empty.`
`"......The children are alright.`
` All of them stayed up too late last night."`
`"The servant room is empty.`
` ...I looked at the shift chart, and the mornin' shift was supposed to begin at six.`
` They should have started workin' by now..."`
`"The nap room was also empty.`
` There were signs that the futons had been used, but they weren't warm."`
`"Y'know what, I think Krauss nii‐san and the others might've hit on it, don't you?`
` ......This is probably a game planned on Father's orders.`
` I'd bet my bottom dollar, he left those creepy scribbles and hid himself somewhere,`
` tryin' to make us do somethin'."`
`"......Are you saying that he's trying to see who is fit to inherit his wealth and the family headship?`
` ...Isn't that a bit..."`
`"No...`
` ...It might not be strange if Father was behind something like that."`
`"After all, Father loves big tricks.`
` ......He might have had this plan brewing ever since that epitaph was hung in the hall."`
`"...In that case, I wonder whether he will make an announcement of the game or an explanation of it.`
` ......It also seems possible that another envelope with the crest might appear, like the one handed to Maria‐chan."`
`"............You're right.`
` Maybe Nii‐san and the rest have found that in the mansion."`
`"Doctor Nanjo.`
` Have you heard anythin'?"`
`"......M‐my apologies, I do not have any idea what is going on.`
` And yet, ......yes, I see,`
` I could easily imagine that Kinzo‐san is planning something big."`
`"...Why don't we go back to the mansion for now?`
` Maybe they found somethin' over there."`
`"If I will not be in the way, I will come too."`
`"I, I'll stay here.`
` ...The children are sleeping upstairs.`
` We don't know what's happening.`
` We can't leave them alone."`
`"......Yes, you're right.`
` I'll stay with Rosa‐san and watch over the place.`
` Would you tell that to my husband?"`
`Rosa and Kyrie remained in the guesthouse.`
`{n}Hideyoshi went with Nanjo, and returned again to the mansion.`
`Meanwhile, in the mansion...`
`Unbelievably, ...or maybe we should say that bad feelings have a tendency to be right...`
`Rudolf's prediction was right on.`
`...Because the same magic circle graffiti that had been drawn on the doors to the boiler room and the parlor had been found in multiple other places throughout the mansion.`
`"Aniki...!`
` How's Dad?"`
`"No, no good.`
` There was no response at all.`
` I did try putting my ear against the door, but I couldn't sense anyone."`
`"...I cannot find the servants anywhere.`
` ...Where in the world did they disappear off to..."`
`"This isn't funny.`
` Father and the servants are hiding, and there are strange magic circles all over the mansion.`
` ......What in the world is happening...?!"`
`There weren't only magic circles on the door to the boiler room and the door to the parlor.`
`{n}There were also two on the second floor,`
` and one on the third floor, for a total of five.`
`They were all the same magic circle, and all of the doors were locked, so they couldn't check inside.`
`"...Anyway, let's do something about the boiler room first.`
` It would be bad if some kind of breakdown caused a fire or an explosion.`
` ...So we need the key."`
`"I believe there was a key box in the servant room."`
`They fished through the key box in the servant room.`
`Because each servant individually carried their own master key around, those weren't kept here.`
`However, all of the individual room keys should have been here.`
`"............It's so packed with keys."`
`"...It isn't here.`
` I've looked and looked, but I can't find the key to the boiler room."`
`"Look, Aneki.`
` ......Only the keys to the rooms with those magic circles drawn on them...`
`are just neatly missing."`
`"......It's true.`
` ...How troublesome......"`
`"It's as though someone doesn't want us to go in the rooms with the magic circles.`
` ......No, they went to all the trouble of making them obvious using the magic circles, so perhaps they do want us to enter...?"`
`"I think it's the latter.`
` ...Breaking down the door is probably impossible, I mean, this isn't a movie.`
` Smashing a window might work."`
`Krauss had a little trouble deciding whether this was a situation that called for smashing a window.`
`At that time, Hideyoshi and Nanjo returned.`
`{n}There was nothing strange in the guesthouse, and the children were safe.`
`{n}They told the others that Rosa and Kyrie had stayed to watch over the place.`
`"Good morning.`
` ...I hear that something strange has happened."`
`"Good morning, Doctor Nanjo.`
` ...I apologize for waking you so early in the morning."`
`"What is it?`
` Didn't you find a letter or somethin'?`
` I was sure you would have found somethin' like that by now..."`
`"......You're right.`
` I also believe that this is a massive joke or game of Father's...`
` But if that was the case, there should be some letter telling us about that.`
` Like the letter that was given to Maria‐chan."`
`"What if the announcement of the game actually was Maria‐chan's letter?`
` The details of the game—‘try to solve the riddle of the epitaph’—have already been shown."`
`"Then, what could the five magic circles we found in the mansion mean?`
` ...And the missing servants."`
`"......Natsuhi nee‐san.`
` How many servants were there total today...?"`
`"Huh?`
` .........Genji, Gohda,`
` ......five of them, why?"`
`"......Five servants.`
` And five magic circles.`
` ......It may be a coincidence, but it worries me."`
`"...Nii‐san.`
` Let's break a window.`
` We should check and see what's inside."`
`"............We have no choice.`
` Do it neatly."`
`Krauss made his decision, and gave permission to smash a window.`
`And they decided that the first room they would break into would be the parlor on the first floor, where the windows would be easiest to reach.`
`They had hoped to peek in through the window,`
` but the curtains were drawn, so they couldn't see inside.`
`Rudolf wandered around the garden, trying to find something that would be good for smashing the glass.`
`Eventually, he found a rock bigger than a fist, and came back.`
`"You don't have to smash the whole thing.`
` Just open it enough so that you can reach the lock."`
`"Don't get your hopes up, alright?"`
`Rudolf raised the rock, and hit the glass with it several times.`
`Before long, he succeeded in skillfully opening a hole big enough that he could unlock it from the outside.`
`...Covering his hand with a handkerchief, he stuck his hand through that hole, and cautiously unlocked it.`
`"We should probably cover it with duct tape later.`
` The rain'll get blown in."`
`When he threw the window open, the wind and rain made the curtains dance around violently.`
` He swiped the curtain to the side.`
`...They could see the parlor they knew well.`
`They were a little relieved.`
` ......Because they had thought that maybe, the room would be filled with more bizarre magic circles,`
` or possibly the traces of some creepy ritual.`
`In any event, they didn't want to hang around out in the rain,`
` so the six of them—Krauss, Natsuhi, Eva, Hideyoshi, Rudolf, and Nanjo—entered the parlor as a group.`
`"......It seems...that nothing in particular is out of the ordinary..."`
`".........mmh—"`
`"Wh‐what has happened, Shannon...?!"`
`"Wait, wait, are you alright?!`
` What happened to you?!"`
`"Blood, blood!!`
` D‐D‐Doctor Nanjo, take a look at this!!"`
`"Hey, Shannon‐chan!`
` Are you okay?!`
` Answer me!"`
`"Y‐you mustn't shake her...`
` I will examine her condition now..."`
`She had been in the shadow of a sofa, so they hadn't noticed her until they entered the room.`
`Shannon was lying on the floor, her chest stained bright‐red with blood......`
`"He~~y,`
` Battleeer, where are yoooou?`
` Look, look, Shannon's corpse has turned up, see~~~?`
` I won't bully you anymore, so come out."`
`"......Hmmmm?`
` Oh, there you are.`
` What are you doing, holding your head in a place like that?"`
`".............................."`
`Battler had his head pressed to the table, and was clutching it with his hands...`
` His pitiful figure made it plainly clear that he didn't want to see anything, didn't want to hear anything...`
`Had he heard {f:5:Beatrice}'s sneering voice?`
`...Could he not hear, or was he pretending that he couldn't hear?`
` In any event, it was clear that he had closed up his heart like a shell...`
`"Pu ku ku ku...`
` ......I wonder if you have tormented him too much, Milady.`
` After showing him that much and demanding a counterargument,`
` I can understand why he wants to mope around."`
`"Hey, Battleerr.`
` If you can't argue back, resign, would you?`
` It's your turn.`
` If you don't make some move or pass,`
` or else give up, we won't get anywhere."`
`"..............................et."`
`"......Huh?`
` What's that?`
` I can't hear you?"`
`"I said BE QUIET!!`
` Aaaah, shut up shut uuuuuuuuuup!!`
` Witches? Magic?!`
` Can't you just do what you want, I don't believe, I don't believe any of it,`
` damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it!!"`
`"Don't talk to me, don't show me anything, go away, go away, go the hell away!!`
` Get your goddamned annoying face AWAY FROM MEEE{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}EEEEEE!!!"`
`"........................!!!"`
`{f:5:Beatrice} instinctively winced at Battler's sudden rage.`
`"......E‐even if you say that, um...`
` If you don't finish your turn, then my turn won't come.`
` I feel like saying, don't make me too bored—"`
`"You think I give a crap, be quiet, SHUT UP!!`
` I don't give a damn about your game,`
` I can't take this bullshiiiiit!!`
` If your turn won't come until mine is finished, then you can just wait for all stinking eternity, can't you!!"`
`"Aaaah, I don't care I don't care I don't get it!!`
` I won't accept witches or magic, I won't accept something that fucked up!!`
` Uuooooooooooohhh, I said DON'T TALK TO MEEEE{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}EEEEE!!!"`
`......I don't know what's what anymore.`
`{n}After being shown something that screwed up, how could I continue to resist...`
`I wandered aimlessly through the rose garden.`
`......It was raining and windy, but that didn't mean my body got wet.`
` ...There was just a feeling of isolation as I wandered amidst the wind and rain without an umbrella.`
`"..................Maybe I...`
`lost to her game a long time ago."`
`...Actually, I wonder whether we hadn't reached a clear resolution in the previous game.`
`After all, I had submitted to her for a time.`
`{n}So the world had been tinted with witches and magic.`
`......Right now, Rokkenjima is a different world, where witches stride around openly and fire off strange magic.`
`...It isn't a matter of accepting it or denying it.`
`Maybe I had mistakenly assumed that I was playing a game on an even footing with Beato.`
`I had already been defeated in the last game, ...and this may just be the signing ceremony of my surrender.`
`Just now, a mighty battle had unfolded in this rose garden.`
`{n}I had seen it with my own eyes.`
`I kicked the ground.`
` ......Obviously, the ground was hard.`
`{n}And a puddle splashed.`
`Several towers had split this ground, sprouting like high‐rise buildings.`
`......The more I kicked this ground,`
` .........the more it felt like that really couldn't be possible.`
`But, because of that, I couldn't explain it with anything other than magic anymore......`
`"......I get the locked rooms with the key shut up inside,`
` they're probably just an extension of what you always see in detective novels.`
` ......But, ......that stuff, though...`
` All that big flashy stuff......`
` Damn iiiiit........."`
`"...............It seems that my disciple has caused you much trouble."`
`"...Huh?`
` .........It's you..."`
`I was suddenly spoken to, so I turned around,`
` ...and in the rose garden arbor,`
` ......was the Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice}, who {f:5:Beatrice} had supposedly defeated a short while ago.`
`".........I was sure you'd died.`
` So, you were alive."`
`"No, I died.`
` ...Now, I am nothing more than a captured chess piece loitering outside the chessboard."`
`"You're Beato's master, right?`
` So, in other words, you're a witch too."`
`"......Yes, that is correct."`
`"Tch.`
` So, in other words,`
` ......that means witches really do exist?`
` And I'm not the one who can defeat her.`
` That'd be you, since you can use awesome magic, wouldn't it?`
` ...I'm just useless now.`
` There's nothing I can do anymore..."`
`"............Oh, my.`
` Have you submitted completely?"`
`"What do you mean, submit?!`
` How the crap should I explain that?!`
` Towers sprouting and falling!!`
` Huge giants holding shields and throwing spears!"`
`"Aaah, just remembering it makes me feel like I'm going insane, reasoning isn't worth a damn anymore, is it?!!`
` We've left the level of tricks and explanations with human culprits!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaahh, shit shit shit shit!!"`
`"Calm yourself.`
` ......I am nothing more than a piece on that child's game board.`
` After being removed from that board, I am no longer a being who can do anything."`
`"But you are that child's opponent.`
` As long as you do not give up by yourself, you will always have the power to strike back at that child."`
`"Shut up!`
` Weren't you also reciting strange spells and summoning towers and spears?!!"`
`"What do you mean, strike back?!`
` Are you saying you'll teach me magic too, telling me to fight her in one of those massive magic battles?!!"`
`"......If you wish,`
` I could teach you a bit about magic."`
`"Oh, just what I wanted!`
` Please, give me some awesome magic to smash her chest in one blow...!!`
` Hah, don't screw with me!"`
`"I hear that in Japanese magic, there is a ceremony to pray for rain.`
` Do you know of it?"`
`"Rain ceremony?`
` That thing where you throw stuff into the fire and offer a dance?`
` ......That's not magic.`
` The fire causes a thermal, and as a result, rain clouds gather.`
` I'm pretty sure that's an accepted scientific phenomenon."`
`"Oh?`
` ...I had believed that it was a form of eastern magic,`
` but it isn't magic?`
` I had believed that people offered sacred fire to the heavens, as well as a dance of respect,`
` so that your entreaty for rain would reach the hearts of the gods."`
`"Maybe people did that long ago.`
` But most occult things like that have a scientific explanation."`
`"Why do things burn?`
` Isn't that because phlogiston is contained in the material?"`
`"......No, things burn because of an oxidation reaction.`
` Lavoisier abolished the phlogiston theory."`
`"Why does heat transfer through objects?`
` Isn't that because caloric is contained in the material?"`
`"......I'm pretty sure that was abolished by Joule.`
` Heat is energy, not a substance."`
`"You have studied well.`
` Your knowledge is correct."`
`"...It's just some random facts."`
`"Phlogiston, caloric, and eventually ether and God's love.`
` ......All are powerless before a scientific explanation.`
` In the past, I was told that an apple falls from a tree...`
`thanks to God's love, so that humans would be given food."`
`"Even gravity was explained by God's love?`
` ...Well, that's probably a leftover from a period when religion rather than science was used to explain everything."`
`"That is correct.`
` In the past, humans called the limits of their knowledge...`
`...no, ignorance itself, "magic".`
` ...Just like the rain ceremony we were just talking about."`
`"Did the people of ancient times...`
`understand the science of fire giving rise to heat to cause a thermal which calls forth clouds?`
` Even without understanding, they at least knew of the result."`
`"......That probably happened a lot.`
` The wisdom of ancestors.`
` Even without understanding the reason, through long experience, they knew that they would obtain that result.`
` ...Phenomena whose principles they didn't understand were probably the same as magic to them."`
`Just like this person had just said, ancient people who didn't understand the principles had probably believed that,`
` through the rain ceremony, their wish had reached the heavens and made the rain fall.`
`To them, that was certainly magic.`
`{n}As long as they didn't understand thermals...`
`"If you press a light switch, the light turns on.`
` ......Children do not know the scientific principles behind why the lightbulb lights up;`
` they press the switch knowing only the result.`
` If they can obtain a result without knowing the principles, isn't that "magic" to them?"`
`"...............That's pretty interesting.`
` ...Well, logically, that's true.`
` ...For example, I don't have a clue why the Braun tubes in a TV show a picture."`
`"However, I think it's completely normal for things to be displayed on the TV.`
` Even if I don't understand the principles behind Braun tubes, I at least know that "if I push the switch I can watch TV"."`
`"...It's exactly the same as having a rain ceremony without understanding thermals.`
` ......In other words, if I don't know the principles, even TV is the same as "magic",`
` no, could you say it is magic?"`
`"Do you know how Braun tubes are constructed?`
` Have you ever taken one apart and looked inside?"`
`"......Nope.`
` I think I read about it in a book or something once, but it was complicated and I didn't have a clue.`
` I think that when electrons hit a fluorescent material, it creates luminescence or something like that..."`
`"That book was a fake.`
` Actually, there are small people called gremlins shut up inside the Braun tubes,`
` and they do their job with magic."`
`"Huh?!`
` That's stupid, there's no way...!"`
`"How can you deny it if you have never looked inside a Braun tube?"`
`"......I've never looked inside, but I can state with confidence that small people like that definitely don't exist!"`
`"Since there is no Braun tube here, that is impossible to prove."`
`"Y‐yeah, it is impossible to prove right this very moment,`
` ...but later I can take apart a TV somewhere and show you, and instantly win the argument!"`
`"So, in other words,`
` my "magic theory", that gremlins are shut up inside the Braun tubes and display the picture with magic,`
` is impossible to disprove until we can verify the contents of a Braun tube, correct?"`
`".........Hmm,`
` .........what the hell, one of those?`
` Are you trying to say it's a "Devil's Proof"?`
` That's your favorite trick, you witches."`
`"The "Devil's Proof" is sophistry exploiting the impossibility of proving a negative fact.`
` However, it is different from what I am talking about with Braun tubes.`
` That could be resolved just by taking apart a single television."`
`"......You're right.`
` It really isn't a "Devil's Proof"."`
`"The scientific theory you propose, and the magical theory I propose.`
` ...One of those is the truth.`
` And which one it is can be ascertained as soon as you look inside the Braun tube.`
` However, until the instant that happens, we cannot deny each other's theories."`
`"So, despite the fact that there is only one truth,`
` until the moment you look into the Braun tube, two conflicting truths can exist at the same time.`
` ......A bizarre space where two truths, of which only one is permitted to exist, may exist simultaneously."`
`Is the cat in the box alive or dead?`
`{n}If you open the box, you will know the answer.`
` You will know the truth.`
`However, until you open the box, you can claim that the cat is alive, and you can also claim it is dead.`
`Each of the two parties makes a claim that according to them is the "correct" truth,`
` and even though the two sides are conflicting, neither can win the argument as long as the box remains unopened.`
`In other words, two truths can exist at the same time.`
`Even though there can only be one cat in the box,`
` it is packed with a living cat and a dead cat, in a strange parallel world.`
`That is what Rokkenjima is now.`
`......This island is now a different world where a science theory and a magic theory exist at the same time.`
`...To a resident of the world of science such as yourself,`
` at a glance, it may feel as though this island has been sucked into a world of magic.`
`While that may be correct, it is not accurate.`
`Strictly speaking, it has moved from the world of science, to the midway point between that world and the world of magic.`
`So at a glance, it appears to you as though the world is tilted towards the magic side.`
`......But actually, this island is now in a perfectly impartial position with relation to the two opposing worlds.`
`"......I don't really get it...`
` Midway between reality and magic?`
` A perfectly impartial world?`
` How's that?`
` Hasn't everything been going really bad for me the whole time...?!"`
`"Then perhaps you could think of it this way.`
` This is a trial.`
` Think of it as a court where you and {f:5:Beatrice} are laying out opposing claims.`
` We could describe it as a Braun tube trial."`
`"That child claims that there are tiny people inside the Braun tubes.`
` And she explains about the lives of the tiny people, what they look like,`
` what type of magical power they have, on and on.`
` ......And you?"`
`"......Well, I study in a library, and argue back by explaining how Braun tubes are constructed, I guess."`
`"At that moment, both your claim and that child's claim exist in the court at the same time.`
` ......If you lend an ear to that child's claim,`
` you may hear it as though it were the truth. See it as though it were the truth.`
` {i:That is precisely what you were shown}."`
`"..........................."`
`"At this moment, on Rokkenjima, witches and magic certainly might exist as truth.`
` ...However, that world is an uncertain wavefunction, existing only until the moment that the cat's box is opened.`
` All states can be justified simultaneously.`
` However, there is one truth."`
`"That is collapsed by observation,`
` and countless truths are weeded out to become one truth.`
` It is like when, in court,`
` the judge makes his judgment.`
` The two truths from the prosecutor's and the defense's claims...`
`collapse by the judgment, and become one."`
`".........So to say it in your words,`
` ......this island right now is the world right before looking into the Braun tube, right...?`
` Therefore, neither the science theory nor the magic theory can be denied.`
` ...And since they cannot be denied—"`
`"Both can exist as truth.`
` That is why both witches and magic can exist.`
` ...However, at the same time, your opinion which denies them can also exist simultaneously as truth."`
`".........It is a world where two conflicting things can exist at the same time.`
` And, it is a world where the conflicting truths cannot disprove each other.`
` .........Is it starting to make sense to you...?"`
`"..................In other words...`
`...no matter how much awesome magic Beato shows me...`
`...that is only a claim from the "magic theory", and it doesn't disprove mine."`
`"So, it's like, "no matter what kind of magic Beato shows me,`
` in this world, that cannot become proof that magic exists"."`
`"That's right.`
` That child will probably even try to explain an apple falling from a tree with magic.`
` That child might shake her staff and pluck the apple with magic,`
` and {i:claim} that she dropped it to the earth."`
`"However, that would be nothing more than another one of her claims.`
` None of her claims can block your opportunity to make a claim.`
` ......In that sense, this world is quite "impartial" to both sides."`
`".........I...get it...`
` ......Still.`
` By that argument, even if I show a sound argument with my "science theory",`
` all it will do is collide head‐on with her "magic theory", and I can't win against her either.`
` Furthermore, there won't be any final judgment unless we peek into the Braun tube."`
`".........Where is the Braun tube in this world?`
` ...It means there's no reason for us to argue.`
` ......Wouldn't it be alright if we just got along and peeked into the Braun tube?"`
`"If there really is a tiny person in there, I suffer total defeat.`
` Otherwise, I win.`
` ......Why do we have to hold this debate without looking into the Braun tube?"`
`"That itself is the "game" which that child has challenged you to.`
` Perhaps, instead of a court, I should use chess as an example.`
` Victory and loss is not determined by a judge.`
` You who are fighting will decide it yourselves."`
`"......Can you win an argument with an opponent in a screwed‐up world where multiple truths can exist at the same time?"`
`"But do you not realize, in point of fact, you {i:were} beaten in an argument, and are sitting here right now submitting...?"`
`"...............Heh.`
` ...Heheheh."`
`"That is all the advice I can give you now.`
` If you wish, I can occasionally give you advice."`
`"......Sure.`
` Thanks, that really helps.`
` ......I'll avenge you."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, thank you.`
` I am looking forward to it."`
`"What's your name?"`
`"...{f:5:Beatrice} used to be my name, but now that I have surrendered it, I do not have a name."`
`".........So, I shall take a temporary name.`
` ......{f:5:Virgilius}.`
` ...No,`
` what about {f:5:Virgilia}?"`
`"{f:5:Virgilia}.`
` Valkyria?`
` Wasn't that the name of a legendary goddess?"`
`"No.`
` It means the one who is a guide to {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......I will guide you to that child who waits at the summit of Mount Purgatory.`
` It should be a fitting name for that kind of guide."`
`"To think that I'd accept help from a witch when I'm trying to deny witches.`
` ......I see.`
` If this is a contradictory world where different claims can exist at the same time, that also works.`
` ...Ihihi, it's almost funny."`
`"I am borrowing that child's words, but you truly are like a phoenix.`
` ......Your will to fight has already been revived."`
`"...Come, if your heart is prepared, return to that child,`
` ......return to the chessboard that child is sitting at.`
` ......I look forward to seeing how far you can fight my disciple."`
`"Yeah, you just watch.`
` ............I won't listen to her babbling anymore.`
` I'll coolly fight to the end.`
` I definitely won't get provoked by her anymore."`
`"Then let us return.`
` To the seat of the battle."`
`"...Oh, ......oooh, Battler...!`
` Where did you hide yourself?`
` *cackle*!`
` I thought the sore loser wouldn't show himself again, you see?"`
`"......Sorry to keep you waiting.`
` I've cooled my head a little."`
`"Aaand?`
` Did you think of a response to that pleasant, thrilling, refreshing, highly acclaimed, wonderful fantasy battle between Master and meeeeeeee?`
` Isn't that impossible to explain without fantasy?`
` Hihhyahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaah?!"`
`"...Milady.`
` You have only just promised to be kind and act refined, remember?"`
`"Ahhyahahahahaha, oops, my mistake.`
` I just get in such a good mood when I see Battler's face, you see?`
` C'mon c'mon c'mon, c'mon then Battler, that battle just now, how will you respond to it?`
` Hmmmmmm?"`
`".................................`
` ...Battle?`
` Did something happen?"`
`"......Whaat?"`
`"Where in this rose garden.`
` Where are all those spears and towers that you grew?`
` Where have they all fallen to?`
` ............They're not here, are they?`
` ......In other words, this is what we see inside the Braun tube."`
`"......Inside the Braun tube, you say??`
` *cackle*, what in the world are you talking about now...?"`
`"In this very moment,`
` there is nothing at all in the rose garden.`
` ...Sure, towers may have been sprouting with magic a short while ago.`
` But that's only until we learn what's inside the Braun tube.`
` ......It is your interpretation that it was a magical battle, and that's nothing more than a claim.`
` And the fact that there's nothing at all here right now is the proof of that."`
`"This is how I argue back about that witch's battle just now:`
` Right now, there isn't anything here, and that proves that nothing happened...!"`
`"..................`
` ......Hahaha, hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!`
` You know, obviously I can't make a huge mess right on the first twilight, and I do like that rose garden, you see?`
` To prevent any damage, I fought inside a barrier.`
` So it's only natural that it wouldn't have any influence on reality."`
`"......That is your "claim"?`
` Well, I guess that works."`
`"However!`
` My claim that, at this point in time, there is nothing in the rose garden,`
` and therefore there was no magic, has not been obstructed in any way!!"`
`"W‐wait, wait, can you deny my magic with that mess?!`
` It is impossible to prove that magic "does not exist"!`
` It's a "Devil's Proof"!!"`
`"The truth is this garden at this very moment!`
` The instant you look inside, the tiny people inside the Braun tube will vanish.`
` And there are no traces of magic here at all!`
` So that battle between you witches {i:did not take place}!!"`
`"Wh‐`
`......what the,`
` th‐that counter......?!`
` That power,`
` ...c‐could it be...?!"`
`"...Have you forgotten, Milady?`
` It is the Multiplanar World Collapsation Technique.`
` The power of a Finite Witch, which is the pair to the power of an Endless Witch.`
` Only an Endless Witch would be able to understand it, and it causes the strongest effect for an Endless Witch."`
`"Sch‐‘Schrödinger's cat box’?!`
` .........Th‐......that old hag of a witch...what an uncalled‐for hint!!"`
`"We've lost time.`
` With the five servants and Grandfather, there are six corpses!`
` Let me check the scene.`
` I've been trudging along wasting time.`
` From now on, I'll speed things up, okay?"`
`"Take a seat, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` It's finally the first twilight, isn't it? Let's start the real thing.`
` Show me what you've got!!!"`
`......The adults' motivations aside...`
`{n}At least for us kids,`
` these were supposed to be a fun couple of days where we cousins deepened our friendship.`
`However, when we woke up, there was an unbelievably cruel reality waiting for us...`
`"............hic, ......hic......!"`
`"................................."`
`George‐aniki and Jessica were crying over Shannon‐chan and Kanon‐kun's deaths.`
`......Right now, everyone who was alive was gathered in the lobby on the first floor of the guesthouse.`
` And there were 12 of us.`
`...Unbelievable, right?`
`{n}There were 18 up until yesterday.`
`{n}...And in one night, a third of that number had lost their lives...`
`My agitation had finally settled down, and, along with my lack of sleep from being woken up so early in the morning,`
` I was beginning to feel like this was just a little unreal.`
`......I want to think this is some kind of bad dream...`
` My cheap escapism kept telling me that was true, over and over.`
`Maria had gone back to sleep in the sofa Auntie Rosa was sitting in.`
`...Rather than her having nerves of steel, she probably genuinely hadn't had enough sleep.`
`The adults were grasping members of Grandfather's collection...`
`of short‐barrel rifles.`
`...Apparently a remnant from the period when he was obsessed by westerns, there were four identical guns altogether.`
`Those had been split up between the four siblings: Uncle Krauss, Auntie Eva, my dad, and Auntie Rosa.`
`Paper boxes filled with bullets lay on the table, and the siblings were silently loading their guns.`
`".........It's a little scary.`
` Even as I stand here touching this,`
` I get the feeling Dad's about to yell "Don't touch that!" and hit me."`
`"Then aren't you lucky.`
` ...No matter how much you touch it, you won't be hit again."`
`"............I can't believe it.`
` ...That Father...`
`.........would meet this kind of end..."`
`"I did think that when it came to Kinzo‐san, he would probably not die normally in his bed,`
` ......but even so, ......it is too horrible..."`
`"Hey.`
` I wonder if that really is Father...?`
` I'm suspecting that it might be a different person's corpse as a substitute to trick us..."`
`"......No, without a doubt, that is Father.`
` You saw his toes, right?`
` In general society, there aren't many humans with six toes on both feet."`
`"But, ............we can't say that there are none.`
` I've heard that polydactyly isn't a rare disease.`
` He was a man who liked big tricks, right?`
` ......He might have prepared a body from somewhere that had the same number of toes on both feet."`
`"Preposterous.`
` What would possess him to do something like that...?!"`
`"......I'd agree if it was a normal person.`
` ...But this is Father we're talkin' about.`
` You can't say for sure that what Kyrie‐san says is nonsense."`
`"............They say it's difficult to confirm the identity of a burnt corpse.`
` However, there should be various ways to examine him from his teeth and his bone structure.`
` If the police investigated, they'd be bound to know whose body it was in an instant."`
`"The problem is that before the police, we need a telephone engineer."`
`"......The boat probably won't come in this typhoon.`
` ...So, will it come tomorrow?"`
`"I expect that the boat will come again at nine o'clock tomorrow.`
` Then, I believe we will be able to contact the police."`
`"......Both us,`
` and the culprit...`
`have been imprisoned on this island, then, until the typhoon passes."`
`.........Just from our parents' conversation, you could probably figure out the general gist, but let's explain the situation anyway.`
`First, early that morning.`
`In various places throughout the mansion, a total of six corpses, of Grandfather and all the servants, had been found one after another.`
`First, Grandfather had been fed to the flames in the boiler room, and was completely burnt.`
`The servants were found dead, each locked in one of the various rooms throughout the mansion onto which magic circles had been drawn.`
`The cause of death for the servants was uncertain,`
` but according to Doctor Nanjo's diagnosis, there was a high likelihood that they had been stabbed by something like a spear,`
` ......or possibly shot by a gun.`
`That was why the adults had started arming themselves with the rifles.`
`And what made the situation even more chaotic was that the telephone lines were out of order.`
` It was unknown whether lightning had caused them to break down or whether the culprit had destroyed them.`
`In any case, contact with the outside was broken off, and we couldn't contact the police.`
`So until tomorrow morning, when the typhoon would pass and the boat would come,`
` we would have to protect ourselves.`
`After all, Rokkenjima was now isolated by the typhoon.`
` And just like how we were stuck on the island, so was the culprit.`
`It seemed that the adults had stayed up the whole night, spending the whole time holding the family conference in the mansion's dining hall.`
` And even so, this crime had occurred in the mansion.`
`......So right when the adults had been getting worked into a frenzy over money,`
` the murderer had been killing under the same roof...`
`Aunt Natsuhi said that they were strict on locking the doors and windows at night.`
`{n}And yet, some suspicious person had entered the mansion.`
`...The adults had decided that the inside of the mansion was too large to be safe,`
` so they had pulled out the guns and moved to the guesthouse, where we had been.`
`.........Which brings us to the present.`
`George‐aniki and us others begged to see Shannon‐chan's body,`
` but the adults refused point blank, saying that we must not until the police arrive.`
`That wasn't just because they had sealed all the rooms to preserve the scene.`
`...After all, the culprit who had killed six people had wandered about that mansion.`
`To the Ushiromiya family right now, the mansion which should have been their home...`
`was like a danger zone that an unknown murderer had entered...`
`It makes sense, I mean, the mansion is vast.`
` There are plenty of blind spots and dark places, and it's just too vast to guarantee absolute safety with this number of people.`
`In contrast, the guesthouse is a much smaller building than the mansion.`
`Two stories tall.`
` Number of rooms...about ten?`
`{n}......Apparently, it had originally been constructed to serve as a boarding house for when the island was to be turned into a resort.`
`So it's easy to grasp the entire structure, and easy to guarantee safety.`
`{n}That makes it a good place to hole up in.`
`......And.`
` There's an extremely high likelihood that this mass murder of six people is a "game".`
`Because the culprit had proclaimed that in a letter.`
`I heard that a Western‐style envelope with the family crest, just like the one Maria claimed to have received from {f:5:Beatrice} yesterday,`
` had been found in the boiler room where Grandfather's corpse had been discovered.`
`This was what the letter said:`
`{e:070:So that there will be no misunderstandings.`
`{n}The game I seek is whether or not you can solve the riddle of the epitaph,`
` not whether or not you can catch me.`
`{n}{n}If you do not solve the riddle of the epitaph, the pitiful sacrifices will further increase in number.`
`{n}It would be more wise to spend your time solving the epitaph than searching for me.`
`{n}{n}If no one can solve the riddle of the epitaph, no one will survive.}`
`{e:070:If a person appears with skill enough to solve the riddle of the epitaph, I will give them all the gold of the Golden Land,`
` the Ushiromiya family headship, and all of my power.`
`{n}{n}I was the one who succeeded the Ushiromiya family headship from Kinzo‐sama.`
`{n}And I look forward to seeing who will receive the headship from me.`
`{n}{n}{nobreak:{m:-3:—}—}{f:5:Beatrice} the Golden.}`
`...This riddle of the epitaph was...that thing.`
`That strange epitaph written in the same place as the portrait of the witch, displayed in the hall of the mansion.`
`Grandfather was the one who ordered that it be written,`
` and the person who solved it would, supposedly, be given the family headship or the hidden gold or something like that.`
`Ever since it was first displayed there several years ago, all the relatives, despite making fun of it in the open,`
` had been secretly been challenging that riddle in private.`
`However, up until today, no one had solved it.`
` We had once again been told to solve that unintelligible riddle, and this time, we had been threatened that if we didn't solve it, we would all be killed.`
`......If this wasn't a "game", what would you call it...`
`The bold opinion that we should search the premises for the culprit did come up once.`
`However, there was a good chance they were armed, and there wasn't necessarily only one of them.`
`And, ...while they might have been able to kill more than six people, they had {i:stopped at six}.`
`In the end, the opinion that we should avoid carelessly antagonizing the culprit,`
` and hole up in a safe place while we waited for the police to arrive, won out...`
`After the adults had carefully checked that the doors and windows in the guesthouse were locked, they set up camp in the lobby.`
`And as they fingered their guns to distract themselves from the tension,`
` their expressions showed that they were already fatigued from this long day, which had still barely begun...`
`There was nothing that I could do.`
`Now, all I could do was be taught how to use a gun,`
` to prepare for the off‐chance that...something would happen which {i:led to an excess of guns}......`
`......That's the way.`
` Just obediently stay there, {i:me and the rest of you}.`
`"...............Six people in the beginning again.`
` And this time it's Grandfather and all of the servants put together."`
`"Most likely,`
` that child has carefully studied your moves from the last game.`
` And she placed the highest priority upon taking the pieces which she guessed you were most likely to first suspect."`
`"......That makes sense.`
` ...Both last time, and the time before that,`
` the servants who know everything about the mansion and who walk around with master keys were always highest on the list of suspicious people."`
`"......A good example in the last game is Jessica's locked room.`
` If I had only accepted that a servant was the culprit, that wouldn't even have been a locked room."`
`"Therefore,`
` ......that child went straight for them.`
` She probably immediately went to block the way of escape that you would ultimately retreat into."`
`"Beato already proclaimed in red that there are no more than 18 people on this island.`
` ...So basically,`
` .........{i:she's saying "give it up"}.`
` ......Now I have to suspect one of the 18."`
`"......That child will probably come at you by stealing the pieces for the 18, and descending as a 19th person who shouldn't exist,`
` thereby making you accept that she is a witch."`
`"......That is because now that her intimidation strategy of trying to force you to submit by showing you magic has failed,`
` she can only make a frontal attack."`
`"......Perfect.`
` Bluffing won't work anymore."`
`"Be careful.`
` Deception is a witch's strongest point.`
` ...No matter what that child says or shows you,`
` it definitely won't threaten the truth that you believe in.`
` Don't forget that."`
`".........Sure.`
` I'll be damned if the same moves are going to work on me over and over.`
` .........Get out here, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Let's get started!!!"`
`"I am already seated at the match table.`
` My turn, too, is already complete."`
`"......Imagine that Madam would turn out to be our enemy.`
` How unfortunate, Milady.`
` ...Our moves will be read thoroughly."`
`"That is no problem.`
` Master's moves are all outdated classics.`
` There is nothing to fear."`
`"...What moves can you make beyond the classics I taught you?`
` I am looking forward to seeing, {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` Is that alright, Battleerr?`
` If a person who denies witches such as yourself accepts a witch as a strategist..."`
`"That stupid provocation is useless.`
` This person is my advisor, no, my second.`
` That doesn't change one bit that this is a fistfight between you and me."`
`"I understand.`
` ......You're so wobbly that you probably need training wheels on your bicycle.`
` Do as you like.`
` Come, begin!!`
` It is your turn!"`
`"Let's begin with the reconstruction of the crime scene.`
` ......{f:5:Virgilia}, if you please!"`
`"The first body discovered was Shannon's.`
` She was found in the parlor on the first floor of the mansion.`
` The door and windows were locked, and a locked room was established."`
`"......Clarification request for Beato.`
` Reconfirm the definition of a locked room."`
`"Mmhm.`
` The term "locked room" refers to a room where the inside and the outside of the room are completely isolated from all travel between them.`
` Of course, no form of intrusion or escape, nor even any interference is possible.`
` That is comprehensive, including a denial of hidden doors, as well as all margin for interference from the outside."`
`"......Henceforth, this definition will be referred to as:`
` "{f:5:Beatrice}'s locked‐room definition"!"`
`"Confirming specifics.`
` ......Define "margin for interference from the outside"."`
`"It refers to all types of direct interference from the outside, such as using a fishing line or a long, thin rod.`
` In other words, you are to conclude that there is not even any gap in the doors or windows by which to use such tricks."`
`"I wonder about that?`
` Even if there wasn't a gap, you should be able to interfere with radio waves, like with a remote control, right?"`
`"Very well.`
` I add to this definition that it is impossible for radio waves and related methods of remote control to interfere."`
`"There's also an extension telephone in the parlor.`
` A device linked with that wouldn't count as remote control, right?!"`
`"The phones are already out of order, damn you.`
` ...Ugh, this is a pain.`
` I'll include that too.`
` All direct and indirect methods of interfering from the outside of the room to the inside of the locked room are impossible."`
`"What about a voice or a knock?`
` Those should be able to interfere from the outside without entering the room, right?"`
`".........Even though it is a locked room, it probably isn't impossible for someone to knock or call out.`
` Whether the room allows for human communication with the outside or not, it does not go against the definition of a locked room."`
`"In other words, you can't define it so that even methods of communication are interrupted?"`
`"That is the case."`
`"Understood.`
` .........So, Shannon‐chan's parlor satisfies "{f:5:Beatrice}'s locked‐room definition"?"`
`"That is correct."`
`".........Locked‐room definition understood.`
` Continue, {f:5:Virgilia}."`
`"Yes."`
`".........Shannon's body was in possession of one master key.`
` The relatives who discovered her collected this."`
`"Repetition request for Beato.`
` How many master keys this time?"`
`"...Hmph. The same as last time.`
` {p:1:There are five, one for each servant}."`
`"Which means this still isn't a locked room.`
` There are still four master keys left.`
` It just means that after Shannon‐chan was murdered, one of the other four keys locked it."`
`"That is correct.`
` .........And, it wasn't only a master key that was found."`
`"Yes."`
`"......Alongside the body, there was a Western envelope with the family crest.`
` Instead of a letter, the key to the second‐floor guest room was inside it."`
`"......The key to the second‐floor guest room...`
` Am I fine to define that as the only key other than the master keys that can open the door to the second‐floor guest room?"`
`"Indeed. There is no problem.`
` And, unlike the master keys, there is only one."`
`"In other words, in order to unlock a specific room, in addition to the five master keys,`
` there is only one other key."`
`"......In other words, this is a message telling them to go to the second‐floor guest room next?`
` So the adults moved to the second‐floor guest room?"`
`"Yes."`
`"The door to the second‐floor guest room was also locked, and a magic circle was drawn on it.`
` ......The relatives unlocked it with the key they had found near Shannon's body."`
`"Inside the room, Kumasawa's body was discovered.`
` The room was a locked room.`
` That definition is based upon "{f:5:Beatrice}'s locked‐room definition"."`
`".........Kumasawa was in possession of one master key.`
` The relatives collected this."`
`"And like Shannon, there was a Western envelope discovered alongside her.`
` Inside was the key to the third‐floor servants' quarters.`
` The relatives moved to the third‐floor servants' quarters."`
`"And there was a magic circle on the door to the third‐floor servants' quarters, and that door was locked?"`
`"Yes."`
`"Inside the room, Gohda's body was discovered.`
` The room was a locked room.`
` Based on "{f:5:Beatrice}'s locked‐room definition"."`
`"Gohda was in possession of one master key.`
` The relatives collected this."`
`"And just as before, a Western envelope with a family seal was discovered.`
` Inside was the key to the second‐floor VIP room.`
` The relatives moved to the second‐floor VIP room."`
`".........What is all of this...?`
` What the hell are you planning...?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` It isn't something worth glaring at me over, is it?`
` It is a locked room, but there are still several master keys that can open it, correct?`
` And I have even been dutiful enough to present you with the keys particular to each room in addition to the master keys."`
`"......I don't like how this is going.`
` ......But I'm starting to see how things will turn out.`
` So it continues like this for all six people?"`
`"Yes, that is correct.`
` Inside the second‐floor VIP room, Genji's body was discovered."`
`"One master key was collected.`
` The key to the underground boiler room was discovered."`
`"They moved to the underground boiler room.`
` Inside the underground boiler room, Kinzo's body was discovered."`
`"The key to the chapel was discovered."`
`"They moved to the chapel."`
`"Inside the chapel, Kanon's body was discovered.`
` One master key was collected.`
` The key to the first‐floor parlor was discovered.`
` ......With this, our reconstruction of how all six bodies were discovered is complete."`
`"A supplement.`
` Along with the key to the chapel, a letter was enclosed in the Western envelope found near Kinzo's body.`
` The contents of the letter were as you saw.`
` It further urged the relatives to solve the epitaph's riddle."`
`".........In that case...`
` ...What's going on?`
` If the last place, where Kanon‐kun was, had the key to the very first room, the parlor, where Shannon‐chan was...`
` That makes six locked rooms, all tied together, right?"`
`"That is correct!`
` The six locked rooms are all tied together.`
` The keys to unlock each are all shut up inside the next room."`
`"In other words, the six locked rooms form one massive locked room,`
` and all of the master keys as well as the individual room keys are shut up inside it...!"`
`"`
`{p:1:Furthermore, all of the doors and windows in the six rooms are normal}.`
` {p:1:No device exists which can lock them without a key, such as an auto‐lock}.`
` *cackle*cackle*, what do you think, it's beautiful, isn't iiiiiiiiiiiit??? Uhhyahhyahhyaaahh!"`
`"As I said, Milady, that is not dignified."`
`When Ronove rebuked her, Beato stuck her tongue at him shamelessly.`
`"Uhihihi, sorry, sorry.`
` I just get in such a good mood playing with Battler."`
`"*cackle*, so, Battlerr?`
` What is your move going to be?`
` If you can't think of anything in particular, I can show you how I made the goats carry the bodies,`
` and sealed all of the rooms with magic, if you waaaaant?"`
`"Do what you want.`
` I'll listen respectfully to this "magic theory" that you assert.`
` However, I can assert my "human theory", which is completely different from your claim,`
` without any interference from your claim whatsoever."`
`"So, in other words!`
` There's no need for me to listen to your bullshit!!`
` Go wave your magic staff or whatever as much as you like and act out how you lock the door with your seven‐colored magic.`
` And before long, I'm sure there'll be people along to stand beside you, advertising their snake oil and all‐purpose kitchen knives!"`
`"{f:5:Virgilia}, reconstruct the crime scene!`
` I'll search for a weakness!!`
` Were they all definitely dead?`
` If one of them is just playing dead, this isn't a locked room at all!"`
`"Nanjo checked that all of them were dead.`
` However, due to the "Devil's Proof", it is impossible to deny the possibility of a wrong diagnosis.`
` ......In other words, she cannot make the likelihood that Nanjo overlooked the fact that they were alive equal to zero."`
`"Here it is, that "Devil's Proof".`
` But there exists a sword which can carve that up...!"`
`"Wh‐what are those people doing?`
` ......Looks like they're having a good time leaving me out of the discussion.`
` I am their opponent, right...?`
` They could pay attention to me at least a little..."`
`"By nature, communication with the opponent is not necessary in order to compete in chess."`
`"......You spoke in riddles when you communicated outside your moves, Milady.`
` ...Perhaps it has come to this because he does not want to be led astray."`
`"...............muu.`
` ......For some reason, I can't accept it."`
`"You are challenging him to a chess match, are you not, Milady?"`
`"That's true, but...`
`...muu!"`
`{f:5:Beatrice} puffed out her cheeks, as though saying "I don't know why, but I don't like it!"`
`"Because the police have not yet arrived at the scene, the human side's ability to prove things is limited.`
` For a strict confirmation of death, I recommend a repetition request."`
`"Alright, that's where I'll strike, repetition requested!!"`
`"‘The six victims are all dead’!!"`
`"......Milady, you have a repetition request waiting, you know?"`
`"Hey, enough lazing around!!`
` Do you decline the repetition?!`
` This is where our battle starts!!"`
`"Wha?!`
` Owowowowoow!!`
` *cackle*cackle*, sorry, sorry, that's fine, I'll respond."`
`"`
`{p:1:Kinzo, Genji, Shannon, Kanon, Gohda, and Kumasawa—these six are all dead}!"`
`"Why are you so out of it?`
` ...Alright.`
` So I've drawn one out of you.`
` That classic where they're pretending to be dead is the first to be denied."`
`"*cackle*!`
` I won't go easy on you anymore, come at me how you like.`
` I'll slice them slantwise one after another!"`
`"And again, repetition requested!`
` No one is hiding in any of the six rooms!`
` Show me that you can deny the existence of people we aren't aware of!"`
`"I'll respond."`
`"`
`{p:1:There is no one hiding in the six rooms}!"`
`"Alright.`
` Now I'm sure that it's only the six of them canned in there.`
` And they aren't pretending to be dead."`
`"......What will you do, what will you dooo?`
` There's already nothing a human could do.`
` Obediently kneel and observe as I control the locks at will with my wonderful magic, alriiiiiiight?"`
`"Quit babbling.`
` And another repetition request.`
` "The six deaths were instant"!"`
`"Instant death?`
` Hoh, what do you mean by that?"`
`"......It means there is a possibility that a single victim on the verge of death managed to escape into the room,`
` and after locking it from the inside to create a locked room, they passed away."`
`"...Hm.`
` A classic locked‐room murder.`
` In the case that the victim is dealt a fatal wound, and is doomed to die at some later time,`
` it is possible for the victim to hole up inside a room to escape the murderer,`
` and then die after locking it, in which case a locked room could be constructed unexpectedly."`
`"In order to deny that possibility,`
` you will need to proclaim that "the six died instantly" with the red truth."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Very well, very well, I'll slay you with my red treasured sword!"`
`"`
`{p:1:The six died instantly}!`
` By instant death, I mean that as soon as they were attacked, they became incapable of action."`
`"Well, death in its full meaning may have taken several seconds or even minutes.`
` But in any event, it was completely impossible for them to take any action of their own will.`
` In that sense, I can state that they died instantly!"`
`"...Everything up until now has just been checking for a classic locked room.`
` My showdown with you over the locked rooms starts now, alright...?`
` If the culprit isn't on the inside, they are on the outside.`
` So they somehow killed them from outside the rooms."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Have you lost your mind?`
` Isn't it true that "a locked room = murder is impossible from the outside"?!`
` Therefore, it's impossible for it to be anything other than a magical murder!"`
`"No, that's wrong.`
` The right thing to say is "a murder really happened = it isn't a locked room"!`
` No matter how much you speak in riddles, this definitely isn't a locked room!`
` It's a sham that only looks like a locked room!"`
`"However, Battler‐sama.`
` {p:1:Only the victims are inside the rooms,}`
` {p:1:and no other people exist inside the rooms}.`
` And by Milady's locked‐room definition,`
` remote murders from outside the room have been clearly denied, have they not?"`
`"Wait.`
` The definition of remote murders is vast, right?`
` Sure, there's stuff like pulling a fishing line from outside the room and strangling the victim inside the room,`
` but that's not all there is."`
`"For example......`
`a trap would make for an excellent remote murder!"`
`"A traap?`
` Hoh, what is that?!"`
`"Just as an example, let's say they were instructed to enter previously decided rooms,`
` and lock the doors from the inside to create a locked room themselves.`
` A trap is set up in those rooms that they don't know about,`
` and they are killed by that.`
` ......How's that?! Now there is no contradiction!"`
`"......There is no problem.`
` It corresponds to the existing state."`
`"...There is no problem on our side either.`
` It does not conflict with Milady's locked‐room definition."`
`"Kuhhahhahahahahahahahaha?!`
` What's with that stupid reasoning?!`
` Nothing suspicious was found in any of the rooms, you know?"`
`"What form did that trap have?!`
` Where was it hidden and how did it operate?!`
` Explain that for all six people, in the parlor, the guest room, the servants' quarters, the VIP room, the boiler room, and the chapel.`
` Well? You can't, can you?!?!"`
`"Decline refutation!!`
` There is no need for me to explain that!!`
` And even so, it doesn't damage my claim!!"`
`"Wh‐what did you saaaaaaaaayy...?!?!"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}, it is a "Devil's Proof".`
` The fact that he cannot explain the form of the trap...`
`does not in itself disprove that there was a trap!"`
`"............Well done.`
` While overbearing, a wonderful move."`
`"...Kh!!!`
` This guy is getting completely used to this......!!"`
`"Check.`
` It is possible to establish this locked‐room murder via a murder trap X that they couldn't find."`
`"......I‐I'll kill that check with the red truth!!"`
`"`
`{p:1:The six were not killed by traps}!"`
`"The definition of trap?!"`
`"Oh...`
`umm...`
`one of those!`
` Something that activates when a victim gets caught in it by their own actions."`
`"Aaah... That's not all!`
` Stuff that activates by remote control or by a timer,`
` ......everything like that is also included!"`
`"Pu ku ku...`
` All devices that can carry out a murder without the direct participation of the person who set it up.`
` I believe that definition may be appropriate."`
`"H‐how's that?!`
` I've struck back!!`
` As though I could let a human defeat this locked room!!"`
`"..................`
` ............You're also frantic, trying to win, huh."`
`"...Whaat...?!`
` What do you mean...?"`
`"......You're also frantically fighting to make me accept that you exist.`
` Until now, I thought that I was just being toyed around with one‐sidedly by you."`
`"...But that was actually wrong.`
` You're also frantically resisting my comeback, fighting to show that you exist...!`
` Now,`
` ...I finally really feel that's true."`
`This isn't torture inflicted on me about whether I'll submit or not.`
`"This is a fight between you and me on an even footing!!"`
`"......Alright, it's starting to get interesting, isn't it?`
` Six people died in locked rooms, and no one else was inside.`
` And there was no meddling from the outside, and also no traps.`
` If I was still how I used to be, I would probably think this had to be the work of magic."`
`"......And if you had acted out some strange magic right about now, I'd probably even have surrendered.`
` .........It's that favorite strategy of yours."`
`"...You completely intercept all of my moves, and in the moment that I've tried everything and fallen to my knees,`
` when my heart's defensive power is at its weakest, you show off some strange magic and take the game all at once!!"`
`".........She has always had a short temper.`
` She still has that bad habit of rushing things when victory is in sight."`
`"Pu ku ku.`
` Because Milady cannot stand putting things off."`
`"Heeey, shut up, shut up!!"`
`"It is your turn, Battler!`
` The "trap piece" that you advanced, I have cut down with red!`
` What will you send out next?`
` Show me what you've got!!"`
`"Right!!`
` Now that even traps have been defeated, at a glance, this looks like a perfect locked‐room murder.`
` ......And that's why this is where I'll flip over the chessboard!!"`
`"...Here it is, your special technique!`
` What exactly are you going to flip over, and how?!`
` Try showing meeeeeeeeeeee!!"`
`"Yeah, I'll show you!!`
` It's not about thinking how to kill six people inside locked rooms from the outside!"`
`"Yeah, that's no good, no good, no goddamn good at all!`
` That's right, it's not about how to kill from the outside.`
` It's about how they died inside the room and created a locked room!"`
`"......That's it, this is the answer!!`
` If you assume that one of the six victims was the culprit,`
` this locked room can be explained extremely easily!"`
`"Wh‐whaaaaaaat?!`
` No way!`
` I believe I clearly said in red that the six of them were dead......!!"`
`"Six people did die.`
` Five were victims who were killed.`
` If you assume that the other person committed suicide, you can destroy this locked room!!"`
`"......Certainly.`
` If the culprit locked themselves in the final locked room,`
` and threw away their own life, this locked‐room chain would be established."`
`"The culprit's suicide.`
` ...Normally, it is an unthinkable move,`
` but the argument that it doesn't exist because it is unthinkable,`
` doesn't exist.`
` ......And he has no responsibility to demonstrate a motive.`
` A truly powerful move, which can only be used in a chess match against a witch...!"`
`"......Well, you cannot say for certain that there is no motive.`
` ...For example, Kinzo had been pronounced as having only a short time left to live.`
` The motive of using his own death as a message, not being afraid to lose his short remaining life,`
` ...may not be impossible to attach."`
`".........Milady.`
` It is our turn."`
`"H‐...hmm!`
` To imagine that you would even trample on the dignity of the dead to create a culprit...!`
` What a heartless, cold‐blooded man...!"`
`"Setting up the dead as the culprit.`
` ...This move is worse than inhuman, and it's one you used to attack Kanon‐kun in the last game.`
` ......I'm taking a shot back at you with this move,`
` as a tribute to Kanon‐kun for that time, even though the games are different."`
`"Just now, I have freed that Kanon‐kun from his regrets!!"`
`"Ku......kuuuuuuu......!!"`
`"You have no duty to hold back here.`
` You should check whether suicide was not the cause of death for any of them.`
` I recommend requesting a repetition."`
`"Right!!`
` But suicide is a naive word that won't corner her!!`
` Beato, this is the end!!"`
`"Repetition requested!!`
` "The six deaths were all homicides"!!"`
`".....................That is painful."`
`"Uguu...!!`
` ........................kh...ooohh...!"`
`"Hmmmm?`
` What's wrong, six people were killed, right?!`
` I'm just checking the simplest premise we had at the very beginning, aren't I?`
` Can't you repeat it?!"`
`"I......I decline to repeat.`
` ...Th‐there's no reason in particular."`
`"Refusing to repeat this is the same as resigning, you know?!"`
`"Checkmate!!`
` One of the six was the culprit, and they carried out a suicide after constructing the locked room!`
` We're done!!"`
`"...W‐wait!`
` No, umm, ......I'll say it, I'll say it!`
` I'll use the red like you want!`
` {p:1:None of the six committed suicide}!"`
`"How's that?!`
` Are you satisfied...?!`
` *cackle*cackle*, kakkakakakaka!`
` I've struck back, I've struck back!!!"`
`"Heh,`
` ......what the hell, so you can say it...`
` ...But isn't that weird?`
` Why are you so panicked...?"`
`"......I‐i‐it's your imagination.`
` I am also frantic this time, you see?`
` I don't have much leeway.`
` Don't pay it any mind..."`
`"......The repetition you requested has been modified.`
` Do not be fooled."`
`"..................kuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu..."`
`"Pu ku ku ku...`
` It seems it was useless, Milady."`
`"Th‐that's right!`
` She didn't say "the six deaths were all homicides".`
` She changed it to "none of the six committed suicide"!`
` Which means that one or more of the people was not killed by someone else and didn't commit suicide."`
`".........Aaaaaaaahhh,`
` I've got it, I've got it!!`
` This is the truth!"`
`"After culprit X, who lurks among the six, murdered the other five, they constructed a locked room.`
` ......Then they planned to escape from or hide in that room by some method."`
`"However, {i:there was an accident}!!`
` The culprit died from an accident that even they hadn't expected, and constructed a locked room that even they hadn't desired!!`
` Now it's over, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` Checkmate!!!"`
`"D......damn iiiit!!`
` Did you think I would be cornered by something like that!!`
` I would never scream my resignation over something like that!!"`
`"I'll slice up that foolish checkmate with my red treasured sword over and over again!!`
` Among the six, there were n—"`
`"Mgmf?!`
` Fugagaga, wha are you ooing, fugafuga!"`
`"My apologies.`
` Our side requests some time to strategize.`
` Please allow us a brief postponement."`
`"......It is a just request.`
` I believe there should be no problem."`
`"Sure!! I'll allow that!`
` I've been given those a lot lately.`
` This time it's your turn to use it...!!"`
`"Thank you very much.`
` Come, Milady, ......this way.`
` And let us quietly count to one hundred inside our heads."`
`"Fugafugafuga!!`
` Hunoheh, huhnoheee!!`
` Fugaa!"`
`As Beato grew thoroughly panicked and agitated, Ronove had quickly covered her mouth with his hand, and suspended the game.`
`He then pulled Beato away in the name of a strategy conference...`
`"......Damn.`
` Curse that demon butler.`
` When Beato got all hot, that was an ideal chance to corner her..."`
`Beato normally behaves elegantly, but she actually has a really short temper and gets mad easily.`
`......Her normal intelligence falls silent when she starts getting agitated.`
`"Ronove is composed.`
` ...He probably gave that child some time to cool her head.`
` ......That child was stubbornly trying to remove your check,`
` and was going to easily let several large pieces go.`
` ...After all, the first twilight is only a skirmish.`
` ......That child mistook her timing."`
`"......So, what does it mean?`
` Did I create a checkmate, or didn't I?"`
`"That child was going to proclaim it in red.`
` It probably wouldn't have become checkmate yet.`
` ......But, I imagine,`
` that child will proclaim her resignation once she has cooled her head."`
`"...Surely not.`
` Even though she hates losing...?"`
`"Yes.`
` In a losing battle, it is essential to withdraw your troops as soon as possible to try to minimize your losses.`
` ......The difficult part is measuring whether it is a losing battle or not.`
` ...It seems that that child's butler calmly made that decision."`
`"......Oh well.`
` In other words, she got away with only a second to spare.`
` ......Looks like...`
`I won't be getting checkmate and delivering the final blow so easily."`
`"However, you should measure this as your victory.`
` They seem to have just barely prevented a large loss,`
` but without a doubt, you dealt considerable damage.`
` ......I am sure you were able to understand well the depths of that wound by watching the way she panicked."`
`"Seriously.`
` Ihihihi, it feels like she'd start crying if I bullied her any more than this."`
`As we talked, Ronove returned with Beato, who wore a meek expression.`
`...She didn't have the same bold smile as usual, but it looked like the blood wasn't rushing to her head anymore.`
`".........Hey.`
` It's your turn.`
` Did you decide your next move?"`
`"I resign.`
` ......For now, I will let you have your victory."`
`Beato told me that frankly.`
`{n}It seemed as though she had taken a far‐sighted view, as though saying "if you want to laugh, then laugh".`
`......It was a bit of a buzzkill, and I lost my desire to attack her further.`
`"Well, now that you've resigned, in the end,`
` all that means is that we're even, since my theory and yours can't deny each other.`
` I'll treat it more like a tie than a loss."`
`"......I don't need your disgusting compassion.`
` I say that this time, it is my loss.`
` ...When you find a dog drenched with rain, are you inclined to whack it with a stick or something?"`
`"Nope.`
` Unlike you."`
`".............................."`
`Even though she ridiculed me horribly when I showed signs of defeat, she was so pathetic when it was her turn.`
`I thought of her as a pretty unfair person, but I decided to act with dignity as a winner and accepted it.`
`......Beato had resigned.`
`{n}That was the only result of the first twilight.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} couldn't counter my move of "one of the six was the culprit,`
` and that person died in an accident".`
`...No, she probably could have countered it, but because of some strategic decision, she had given up.`
`I felt less like I had won, and more like she had escaped me one step from victory...`
`In chess against witches, it is possible to battle onward solely using pieces called X which don't need explanation.`
`Thanks to the "Devil's Proof", I can create as many strange fictions as I want, and use them to fight in the argument.`
`...But that's only within the context of chess with a witch.`
`{n}......In our human world, such an abstract story can't explain anything.`
`The first twilight today was a chain of six locked rooms.`
`{n}...It certainly may be possible for a human.`
`Beato hadn't been able to completely deny everything.`
`However, I don't have a clue who committed the crime,`
` why, and how they actually did it...`
`I shouldn't say this having won,`
` ......but I get the feeling that I would have felt less muddled...`
`if I had just been told right out by {f:5:Beatrice} that it was completely impossible for a human.`
`Although I hide behind these abstract pieces called X,`
`{n}............I couldn't deny that some kind of unthinkable,`
` creepy intention had definitely pervaded this mansion...`
`The true enemy of holding a fort probably isn't the fear of unseen enemies.`
` It's whether you can keep it going over a long period of time.`
`Maria had gotten bored and had started making a ruckus because she wanted to watch TV.`
` Since there was no TV in the lobby, she decided to return to the cousins' room upstairs.`
`The adults probably didn't want to leave Maria all on her own, among other reasons.`
` They told all the children to go to the cousins' room upstairs.`
`George, his heart wounded by the loss of his fiancée, had no willpower to resist that, and led the cousins upstairs.`
`At first, Nanjo had been reading a book in the lobby,`
` but when he noticed that the relatives looked like they wanted to talk about something shady,`
` he said "It seems I am in the way..." and returned to his room upstairs.`
`".........I'm starving.`
` And if I keep just sitting around, my drowsiness will be even worse."`
`"It's only natural.`
` Because we didn't sleep last night."`
`"...We will probably end up barricaded here for a full 24 hours.`
` It may be wiser to take naps in turn instead of over‐stressing ourselves."`
`"I agree.`
` My husband and I will be here, so anyone who finds this difficult should rest without overdoing it."`
`"They might be expecting that, you know?`
` They may not be able to defeat this many people, but if that number was reduced by a certain amount, they may plan to use that to their advantage."`
`"There are seven of us here.`
` Two of us could rest for three hours at a time.`
` ......It's a long time until tomorrow morning.`
` We still have some energy now, but tonight's going to be tough."`
`"Sure will be.`
` Anyone sleepy?`
` Don't overdo it, rest."`
`Hideyoshi looked around at everyone to see who wanted to sleep first, but no one volunteered.`
`...Everyone was just as tired, but no one was bold enough to be able to sleep now.`
` ......Their fear of the unknown culprit was just as strong as their sleepiness.`
`"......Nobody?`
` Well, don't overdo it, everyone."`
`"If we get tired, we can think about it then.`
` ......I certainly am tired, but I'm not in the mood now."`
`Eva spoke sharply, and then read once more over the second letter from {f:5:Beatrice}, which had been found in the boiler room.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} had sent them two letters, and had repeatedly told them to solve the riddle of the epitaph.`
`And she had even provoked them by saying she would give up the inheritance, both assets and headship, if it could be solved...`
`Eva took out a notebook and opened it to a page with the epitaph copied onto it.`
`"............Is that the epitaph?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......Although it's annoying to do as the culprit says,`
` after all, we do have time to waste.`
` I think it's the perfect way to stave off boredom."`
`"...Not a bad way to kill time.`
` Why don't we challenge it together as siblings?"`
`"......Can I borrow that?`
` I'll rewrite it just a little larger.`
` Natsuhi‐san, do you have a slightly larger piece of paper?"`
`"There should be paper in the servant room.`
` I will bring some."`
`Natsuhi immediately brought a B4 blank sheet of paper from the servant room.`
`Kyrie borrowed Eva's notebook, wrote out the epitaph on the paper, and laid it out on the table.`
`Straight away, everyone peered down at it.`
`{n}...A fence of people naturally formed.`
`"I've heard about it, but...`
`...really, this is a tough riddle.`
` I don't have a clue what it's talking about."`
`"At one point, I also did my best to challenge it, but I was just as clueless."`
`"If we did know, we wouldn't have come all the way out here with a plan to make money.`
` After all, it's ten tons of gold."`
`"............This is the first time I've read it seriously, but...`
`...roughly speaking, couldn't it be split into three parts?"`
`"...I've been thinking this since last night, but you really do seem to be a good thinker, Kyrie‐san.`
` It's possible that you could easily solve this riddle that we couldn't."`
`"Yeah.`
` Kyrie's sharp.`
` ......She might be able to tackle it in an interesting way if we don't give her any strange preconceptions."`
`".........Yes.`
` Kyrie‐san.`
` Will you let us hear your honest thoughts having read the epitaph?"`
`"I think it probably won't be very useful to all of you.`
` You all give me too much credit."`
`"No way, anything that comes to mind would be helpful.`
` Let us hear what you have to say.`
` ......Because your hints always help me when I'm worried."`
`"Oh, so they were helpful?`
` It's nice to finally hear about this now."`
`"Come ooon, don't I always thank you?"`
`"You two do get along well.`
` I'm jealous."`
`"And the rest of us would also love to accept your hints.`
` It's alright, we're just killing time anyway, so why not relax?"`
`Kyrie was bewildered by all this praise she was suddenly receiving.`
`...But they had plenty of time.`
` She realized that this was just a way to waste time, and she decided to accept that role...`
`"......I'm sure I'll say something off the mark, but...`
`well, I'll put forward my ideas."`
`"Mmhm.`
` ......What did you mean in the beginning, about how, roughly speaking, it could be divided into three parts?"`
`"Well...I just mean what I said.`
` I think that overall, the epitaph can be divided into three parts."`
`"First, there are the five lines up to and including "There the {loghint:kagi:key} to the {loghint:ougon:gold} sleeps".`
` Up until this point is the first part, which points to the location of the key."`
`"And then there's the part formed by the eleven lines up until the tenth twilight, which refer to the location of the {loghint:ougonkyou:Golden Land} itself."`
`"And the remaining six lines make up the part after the Golden Land has been reached."`
`"I see.`
` The key, the Golden Land,`
` and the Golden Land's {loghint:takara:treasure}; it can be divided into these three parts."`
`"Even we have been able to grasp that much.`
` The three sections that refer to the key, the door, and the treasure."`
`"...Nii‐san, don't butt in any more than you have to!`
` Let Kyrie‐san speak her ideas freely."`
`"Kyrie.`
` Please continue.`
` ......We recognize the same thing regarding what you said.`
` So then?"`
`"......I wonder what that thing in the beginning, the "{loghint:natsukashiki:beloved} {loghint:kokyou:home of old}", means.`
` Thinking about it normally, would it refer to Grandfather's home?"`
`"Since he explicitly mentioned that it's {loghint:natsukashiki:beloved}, I can imagine that it's a home he thought about very deeply.`
` ......Didn't Father come from Odawara?"`
`".........Odawara is definitely where he was born,`
` but I don't think this home Father loved was Odawara.`
` I believe all of us siblings are thinking of the same place."`
`"...Yes.`
` This probably isn't Odawara.`
` From what I've heard, he had a very fun time as a youth."`
`"Hahhaha.`
` ...Dad's greatest misfortune in his life was probably being made the Ushiromiya family head."`
`"......Probably.`
` Father really hadn't wanted to become the Ushiromiya family head."`
`"So where is it?`
` And is there a {loghint:kawa:river} where {loghint:ayu:sweetfish} swim?"`
`"......Maybe there was at the time.`
` I'm sure that there has been a lot of development there by now, so the sweetfish might have disappeared.`
` It would be extremely difficult to investigate whether there were sweetfish there during the time Grandfather was a boy."`
`"There's not just one river, either.`
` I believe we all investigated thoroughly in a geographical sense.`
` ......You even went to the actual place to investigate directly, didn't you, Eva?"`
`"That was only as a vacation.`
` ......But the townscape had changed completely from Father's time.`
` After all, there was a war in between.`
` It was impossible to even figure out where Father actually lived.`
` ...Probably, even if Father dragged himself to the actual location,`
` by now, even he wouldn't be able to determine where it was that he lived."`
`"They've had a remarkable revival over there, after all..."`
`"............Doesn't any place name come clearly to mind after hearing "{loghint:ayu no kawa:sweetfish river}"?"`
`"Not really.`
` I mean, they're sweetfish, right?`
` People say they live in rivers with {loghint:kirei:clean} {loghint:mizu:water}, so there are countless rivers we could guess at.`
` Any {loghint:ogawa:stream} that Dad innocently went {loghint:ayuzuri:sweetfish‐fishing} in was probably buried by the development later.`
` It would be different if we had a map from before the war, or a person who knew a lot about how the area was before the war, but..."`
`"......It probably isn't something like that."`
`"What do you mean...?"`
`".........Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old.`
` You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key.`
` ...After these two lines, there is a single blank line."`
`"...Something is being presented with just these two lines.`
` I would suppose the next three lines continue based upon that something."`
`"I wonder what it is that's being presented, then...?"`
`"......I don't know.`
` In any case, after just these two lines, it's not something vague like you don't know which river it is...`
`you're able to narrow it down and say specifically what "{loghint:kawa:river}"."`
`"......It may be that this isn't a "river" with water flowing down it.`
` ...The "sweetfish river" might be some kind of metaphor.`
` ......What kind of image does the word sweetfish have?"`
`".........Sweetfish are like {loghint:shake:salmon}.`
` They're {loghint:tansui‐gyo:freshwater fish}, but they go out into the {loghint:umi:ocean} right after they're born.`
` And when they get big, they return to the river to live there,`
` and then they {loghint:sanran:spawn} there and end their lives there."`
`"Well, they leave their home at one point, but the part about them getting big and returning there to lay {loghint:tamago:eggs},`
` that might have a family prosperity type of image."`
`"Huh.`
` They're freshwater fish, but they can live in the {loghint:kaisui:ocean}?`
` I didn't know that.`
` I thought they were {loghint:kawa‐zakana:river fish}, so they couldn't go out into the sea."`
`"And they are also called {ruby:kougyo:{p:0:香魚}} (aroma fish) because they have a pleasant smell.`
` I have never eaten one, but I have heard that they are very delicious when {loghint:shioyaki:grilled with salt}."`
`"Whoa, Natsuhi‐san!`
` You've never eaten salt‐grilled sweetfish?!`
` They're delicious!`
` I'll treat you sometime!"`
`"It is a food for commoners.`
` It isn't appropriate for your mouth."`
`"......This is just my wild idea,`
` ...but the image I get from a sweetfish river has made me suspect a {loghint:kakeizu:family tree} before.`
` The sweetfish go out into the ocean for a time, but they return to the river where they were born to spawn, right?`
` .........It makes me think about myself."`
`"......You're right.`
` I can confess now...`
`that I have sometimes suspected that it refers to you and Maria‐chan."`
`"I see.`
` ......As you travel down it, you will see a village.`
` The only "village" ({ruby:sato:{p:0:里}}) you'll find by going down the family tree is the one in Maria's name ({p:0:真里亞})."`
`"Right?!`
` ......But as you all know, Father has a dislike of Maria,`
` and he has almost never spoken with her."`
`"Besides which, Father once told me to give Maria a completely different name.`
` I just made it Maria on my own.`
` Father was very mad about that."`
`"......If you think about the history there,`
` I just really couldn't imagine that he'd reference Maria's name in his precious epitaph about who would inherit his wealth and the family headship."`
`"Have you ever let Maria‐chan read the epitaph?"`
`"Um, yes. Of course I have.`
` But she didn't seem to have a clue.`
` ......She didn't have a clue, and she kept going on about that same occult stuff, about how it was a {loghint:fukkatsu:resurrection} {loghint:gishiki:ceremony} for the witch."`
`"............A connection between Father and Maria.`
` ...Certainly, they do share that occult hobby, but they never interacted.`
` ...I can't imagine it refers to Maria either."`
`"......What interests me is the fact that he explicitly added the word "{loghint:natsukashiki:beloved}" at the beginning.`
` ......Like you all said just now,`
` if Father was reluctant about becoming the Ushiromiya family head,`
` would he describe it that way?`
` ...I don't think it is Odawara, which points back to the Ushiromiya {loghint:honke:main family}."`
`"......I believe that this word "beloved" here at the beginning...`
`definitely refers to a place full of very important memories to Father."`
`"...............Hmmmmmm.`
` ...Well, that's fine.`
` It'd be hard to pinpoint since we don't have a clue about a map from that time,`
` but anyway, there were probably several rivers with sweetfish swimming in them near Dad's home during his youth."`
`"That's if it's a river with water flowing down it, right?`
` And then?`
` Go on, Kyrie‐san."`
`"......I don't really understand the three lines starting with "As you travel down it, you will see a village".`
` ...These are probably coupled with the two lines about the sweetfish river."`
`"It's probably something that we would automatically understand if we knew what the sweetfish river really was.`
` ...As long as we don't understand that, it's probably useless to try and solve those three lines any further."`
`"So we're screwed unless we know what the "sweetfish river" really is...`
` And there's no guarantee it even means a literal river."`
`"...Seriously.`
` The heck does it mean by sweetfish?`
` Were they a {loghint:koubutsu:favorite dish} of Dad's?`
` Or is there some special meaning?`
` Is it pointless to read too deeply into it?"`
`"...If you don't have both a micro and a macro perspective, your field of vision grows narrow.`
` ......Think not too deeply, about a river with {loghint:sakana:fish} swimming in it, or some kind of {loghint:nagare:flow},`
` ...something you can {loghint:kudaru:go down} or {loghint:noboru:go up},`
` keep those kinds of abstract images in mind, and we may be able to come up with more out‐of‐the‐box ideas."`
`"And via the three lines that follow, the answer for the "sweetfish river" ends up at the "key to the Golden Land"..."`
`"If you think about it this way, I wonder if it was a mistake to split it into three parts.`
` There's actually four parts.`
` ......‘Go down the sweetfish river’,`
` "find the key to the Golden Land",`
` "journey to the Golden Land",`
` and "the treasure of the Golden Land"."`
`"Hmmm... ......Truly interesting.`
` While we have this opportunity,`
` would you mind continuing and telling us your opinion about the most central portion of the {loghint:hibun:epitaph},`
` up until the {loghint:dai‐juu no ban:tenth twilight} where we arrive at the Golden Land?"`
`"......That's the most symbolic, ...and also the most disturbing part."`
`"Since it keeps mentioning the word {loghint:ikenie:sacrifice},`
` I can't help but think it has something to do with Father's occult {loghint:gishiki:rituals}...`
` .........How do you see it, Kyrie‐san?"`
`Kyrie recrossed her arms several times,`
` peering into the paper with the epitaph copied onto it as though she was looking through it...`
`"...........................`
` .........This is...very difficult.`
` ...By starting with "You who laid {loghint:te:hand} upon the key",`
` it probably means that you won't be able to continue without understanding the key.`
` ...I'll have to give up, but I'll take a shot at it anyway."`
`"......Just like how the "sweetfish river" isn't necessarily a river with water flowing down it,`
` it is also doubtful whether this "key" is actually something shaped like a key."`
`"Right.`
` There's also the possibility that it's a code or a keyword.`
` ......After all, this key isn't something to be stuck into a keyhole.`
` It's something that selects the six people to be sacrifices for the first twilight."`
`"In that sense, we can state that this key isn't something to open the door to the Golden Land."`
`"......But what a disturbing key.`
` A key that can select six people to be sacrifices..."`
`"How would a key {loghint:erabu:select} anything?`
` ...Does it spin around like a roulette...?"`
`"This key points towards a certain specific group of {loghint:roku‐nin:six people}.`
` ......No, we should say it points to a certain specific group of {loghint:muttsu:six things}.`
` ......If this doesn't mean a literal command to offer sacrifices.`
` ...For example, it could be an anagram."`
`"An anagram?`
` Do you mean a word game...?"`
`"Yes.`
` Ever since Rosa started talking about the family tree and how "village" was a part of Maria‐chan's name,`
` this has constantly been going through my mind."`
`"......It seems as though Rudolf‐san, for example, has run with the words "beloved home of old",`
` and is assuming that it has to something to do with {loghint:chikei:geography} or {loghint:zahyou:coordinates}, but that might not be true.`
` This could be some kind of puzzle, ...or maybe playing with letters."`
`"......I'm sorry.`
` What do you mean by playing with letters?"`
`"Oh yeah, it's like "sucker merry barrellers".`
` What do you get when you take out the e's and r's?`
` Like that.`
` Well, you were raised well, Natsuhi‐san, so you probably haven't heard that one."`
`"Take out the e's and r's? Huh?`
` ???"`
`"Don't.`
` It is an undignified game, inappropriate for you."`
`Only Natsuhi didn't get it and had a blank look on her face.`
`It seemed that she had only guessed the answer had to be something undignified,`
` after hearing Rudolf and Eva's snickers.`
`"Ah, ...Natsuhi nee‐san, it's something like this.`
` There was something like it in Maria's book of puzzles, okay?`
` There's this thing called the Tanuki Notebook."`
`"There's a notebook written in some kind of code, with a lot of "ta"s mixed in,`
` and if you "{ruby:nuki:remove}" all of the "ta"s, then the true sentences pop up.`
` It's a game like that."`
`"Ah......oh, I see.`
` .........??"`
`Natsuhi finally realized the answer to the undignified riddle Rudolf had posed, and her face grew red as she hung her head in embarrassment.`
`"...............So maybe that "remove" part is actually represented by "{loghint:korosu:kill}"...?"`
`"Yes.`
` I was just thinking that too.`
` It's possible that the key to the Golden Land is a word with {loghint:roku‐moji:six characters}."`
`"In other words, ...the "ta" from the Tanuki Notebook...is actually six characters here...?`
` Hmmm, ...this is gettin' complicated..."`
`"Playing with letters, is it...`
` ......Hmmm.`
` In Japan, it really feels like a child's game, but it seems that it is a stylish form of humor among intellectuals in the English‐speaking world.`
` ...It is easy to imagine that Father showed interest in it."`
`"......But right here, I quickly lose my ability to understand it.`
` Up until this point, while it was filled with mystery, it was extremely sequential."`
`"‘Sweetfish river’, "go down it", "then find the key" is all extremely sequential.`
` And we can guess that we gain a six‐character key as a result,`
` ......but in that case, we now don't know {i:what} we kill the six characters from."`
`"That's a point.`
` What do we subtract the six characters from?`
` It doesn't tell us."`
`"...On the second twilight, it says "{loghint:nokosareshi mono wa:those who remain}".`
` ......Which means that, at the very least, that "something" has a finite number of characters.`
` You could read it like it's telling you to continue with the {loghint:nokotta:remaining} characters after the six characters are removed."`
`".........And yet, we don't know what this "something" is, even though it should have been shown to us at the beginning.`
` ...Were we wrong even to assume that this is playing with letters...?"`
`".....................hmmmmm..."`
`Everyone crossed their arms and fell into silence.`
`It felt like they were about to reach a novel understanding that they hadn't been able to before...but they stumbled just one step before it.`
`At that time, Hideyoshi's stomach rumbled heartily.`
`The silence up until then was broken by laughter.`
`"Sorry, sorry.`
` By spinnin' the gears in my head for a change, my stomach's gone completely empty.`
` Looks like skippin' breakfast really takes its toll on me...wahahahahaha."`
`"Natsuhi.`
` Is there nothing here?"`
`"There should at least be enough set aside for breakfast.`
` I will prepare it."`
`"I'm also starving.`
` I'll bet those brats above us are starving too.`
` ...But I doubt there's enough for 18 people here, and for three meals."`
`"You're right there.`
` It'll be a marathon to tomorrow.`
` It might be better if we took a trip back to the mansion and fished around for some canned food or something in the kitchen."`
`"There's nothing more than crackers and snacks, but if that is alright, I can prepare them.`
` But with this many people, there might not be any left for lunch..."`
`"That will be fine for now.`
` Sorry, but would you prepare it for us?"`
`It looked like the men had been taken over with an appetite that stopped all thought.`
`The atmosphere grew more peaceful, and the epitaph investigation meeting broke up for the time being.`
`But Eva kept staring at the paper the epitaph was written on like she was going to burn a hole through it...`
`"............A word game was nothing more than my theory.`
` There is a chance that it's mistaken.`
` Eva‐san, don't take it too seriously, okay...?"`
`".........Thank you.`
` This is something I've decided to do myself.`
` Would you mind leaving me alone?"`
`Eva spoke coldly.`
`...Kyrie didn't bother her any more, and went to help Natsuhi prepare breakfast.`
`"Nee‐san.`
` Shouldn't we also help prepare breakfast?"`
`"Then you go help.`
` I'm busy solving this!"`
`"S‐sorry...`
` Th‐then I'll go help..."`
`".........Come {i:on}.`
` Why are you like this?"`
`"......Huh?"`
`"The Ushiromiya family inheritance will be given to the person who solves this epitaph.`
` You seem to have given up from the beginning, as though it has nothing to do with you,`
` but if you could solve it, even you have the opportunity to inherit the family headship."`
`"......This is a chance to steal everything from Nii‐san.`
` Why aren't you seriously trying to solve it for that once‐in‐a‐lifetime chance?"`
`"...Um, .........umm, ......I......"`
`Rosa hung her head, troubled over how she should answer.`
`{n}...She regretted, for the first time in a while, carelessly speaking to her sister when she was in a bad mood.`
`"If you've noticed anything, say so.`
` Even though Kyrie‐san and I were seriously reasoning, you just kept nodding your head, didn't you?`
` Come on.`
` Isn't there anything you've noticed?`
` Come on!"`
`".........Uh,`
` .........umm,`
` .........`
` ......Isn't...this strange?"`
`"...Strange?`
` What is?"`
`"Umm, ......this word, {loghint:ougonkyou:Golden Land}.`
` The word Golden Land comes up several times."`
`"So what?`
` Do you get some keywords by splitting up the characters in "Golden Land"?"`
`"Um, umm, that's not it.`
` ......Look, isn't just the tenth twilight strange?"`
`"...............Huh?`
` ......ah."`
`"Even though they're all written the "Golden Land" ({ruby:ougonkyou:{p:0:黄金郷}}), for some reason, this one place has the "Home of the Gold" ({ruby:ougon no sato:{p:0:黄金の郷}}).`
` He explicitly mixed in the character {ruby:no:{p:0:の}}, changing the phrasing.`
` It vaguely bugged me that it's only said differently here..."`
`".........ah, umm, ...it's not like it means anything.`
` This is Father we're talking about.`
` It could just be a coincidental change in how he said the word."`
`".........................................."`
`".........Boring."`
`"Oh? What is boring...?"`
`".........Boring, boring."`
`"Well now.`
` I don't have the foggiest idea what this child is grumbling about."`
`"She is probably dissatisfied that you gave Battler‐sama various hints, Madam."`
`"......Noooope?`
` I'm not dissatisfied about that.`
` I'm actually {i:more} satisfied now that that worthless Battler has finally reached the level where he can go along with me."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` Was I a little too friendly with Battler‐kun?`
` Maybe it would be better if the old people went away and left everything to the young kids."`
`"Pu ku ku ku ku..."`
`When {f:5:Virgilia} and Ronove giggled and cackled,`
` {f:5:Beatrice}'s irritation meter finally reached its limit.`
`"Ahhhh, the both of you joining forces and laughing at me!`
` Ronove, hide yourself for a while!`
` Go away, go awaaaay!"`
`"Certainly.`
` Then, I will rest for a while.`
` Pukkukukuku..."`
`Ronove bowed his head, still laughing, and hid himself.`
`After that, all that remained was the figure of {f:5:Beatrice}, who was grumpy and irritated,`
` and {f:5:Virgilia}, who was coolly enjoying her tea.`
`"...............When you said "{p:1:There are no more than 18 people on this island}", you actually cornered yourself."`
`".........I thought so...`
` ............I thought it might have been a {i:little} too early, but...`
` ......I guess it really was......"`
`"If you had led him further astray beforehand, things might have been different,`
` but it really was a futile trump card.`
` You stirred him up instead."`
`In addition to his victory condition of denying the witch,`
` Battler had held onto a different victory condition, since he had wanted to explain things without suspecting any of the 18.`
`Hadn't he been at his weakest when he was being tossed about by these two opposing goals?`
`However, {f:5:Beatrice} had used the red carelessly, and had proclaimed that there were no more than 18 people.`
`...Because of that, Battler had been forced to suspect one of the 18,`
` .........and he had finally begun to build up the readiness that he needed to accept that.`
`Battler was stubborn,`
` but because of that, when he was struck where he was fragile, fissures would crack all over him, like breaking china.`
`That itself should have been his greatest weak point...`
`".........Kuuuuuu.`
` ......Maybe I got a bit too careless after my overwhelming victory last time......"`
`"Yes, you were too careless.`
` ...The last game was a difficult one for Battler‐kun,`
` but it seems...`
`this game will prove a difficult one {i:for you}."`
`"......A broken vase will definitely never return to its original form.`
` ...So it would be more constructive to think of the next move, rather than regretfully picking up the pieces."`
`".........But now that Battler has all the right ideas in his head, how should I plot against him...?"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` Your troubled face is an even better treat than Ronove's cookies."`
`"......Uu.`
` You and Battler and even Ronove keep treating me like a snack.`
` ...Even though I'm not sweet at allll."`
`With a shameful, childlike face that she would never have shown in front of Battler,`
` {f:5:Beatrice} rolled her head around on top of the table.`
`"............Masteeer.`
` .........At least a hiiint."`
`"Oh?`
` What kind of hint?"`
`"If you know a skillful move that will make Battler speechless, and make him want to accept me,`
` I won't ask you to say it outright, so, umm,`
` ...even if it's just a hint..."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, I can't.`
` I am acting as Battler‐kun's ally right now,`
` so I cannot teach you something that would give you an advantage."`
`"...You don't have to be so strict...`
` Your disciple's in troubllle..."`
`"I believe you harshly boasted that you had surpassed your master, correct?"`
`".........Uu...`
` Please act like the old person you are and give me just a bit of your cunning wisdom...`
` Pleease...`
` It's mean if you only help Battleeer..."`
`"My, my.`
` You're still a spoiled child."`
`"......But, it's true that I may have given Battler‐kun a few too many hints.`
` It did serve as a scolding to you,`
` but perhaps it was a little too much support for a fair game."`
`"You see, you see...?`
` Please, Masteeer, at least just a hint to help me on..."`
`"..................Just a hint.`
` Think about what it means by yourself, alright?"`
`"Yeah, yeah!`
` I'll think about it myself, so please!`
` Please, give me one that'll leave Battler down in the dumps, Masterrrr."`
`It was truly shameful how she behaved when Battler wasn't around, even though she acted utterly like a Great Witch in front of him.`
`{f:5:Virgilia} sighed, lamenting under her breath that Beato never seemed to grow up.`
`"Then just a hint.`
` ......Do you know of Aesop's fable, The North Wind and the Sun?"`
`"Of course.`
` It's a story about how the north wind and the sun challenge each other to steal the cloak of a traveler, right?"`
`"That's right.`
` The moral is that violent or impatient methods aren't always necessarily the best decisions."`
`"......You don't have to tell me that.`
` I have already reflected on the fact that I rushed too fast towards victory."`
`"...............`
` Think well about what this means.`
` And furthermore,`
` ......although it seems that Battler‐kun had a slight misunderstanding as well, you too seem to be under a misapprehension.`
` Do you understand the victory conditions of this game?"`
`"...What else is there, other than making Battler submit to me?"`
`".........See?`
` At that point, you are already mistaken."`
`"How am I mistaken?"`
`"Your victory isn't making Battler‐kun submit.`
` ......It is to get Battler‐kun to accept your existence, is it not?"`
`"......What's this?`
` You want me to butter up Battler, and ask him to "Accept me as a witch, pleease?"!`
` How foolish!`
` I will not sink so low!"`
`Grrrrrrrrrrr..., Beato growled, like a dog in a bad mood.`
`{f:5:Virgilia} shrugged her shoulders, snickering at her disciple, who was as short‐tempered as always...`
`"That is my hint.`
` Now you should think deeply.`
` .........In any event, your moves up until now will not work on Battler‐kun.`
` A significant tactical conversion will probably be required."`
`"...I know that even without you telling me.`
` ......I don't have a clue what you mean by the North Wind and the Sun,`
` but anyway, I understand that I will have to change my direction.`
` ......I'll showcase a clever scheme that will surprise even you, Master...!"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` I look forward to it.`
` I wonder how Battler‐kun will tackle that.`
` ......I will be wishing you good luck as well."`
`"After Battler, right?`
` Hmph..."`
`".........Are you going to give up and resign already?`
` If you're that tired, why not just go into a futon and sleep forever...?"`
`...As my consciousness grew vague and I pretended to fight my drowsiness, sinking deeper and deeper into the sofa,`
` "I" scolded "myself".`
`"......Don't you remember how much you dreamed about stealing the position of family head from Krauss...?"`
`"Even though I gave you that chance with my magic, you're already throwing it away...?"`
`You say that, but...`
` ............This riddle is really difficult.`
`Even a wire puzzle would be better.`
`...At least in that case, you're assured that it definitely is solvable.`
`But with this epitaph riddle, I don't know if I'm even assured that.`
`......I might just be fighting a useless battle.`
`...Still hazy, I looked at the notebook which I had been holding the whole time.`
`It was opened to the page with the epitaph, which I had stared at, almost burned a hole through, on so many hundreds of nights I had lost count.`
`......That...is truly a door.`
`On the other side...is the "Golden Land", that place which ever since I was a child I've wished to reach, I've spared no effort to reach,`
` ...and I've never been able to reach.`
`Here I am with both hands upon the door,`
` ...and even though the book, no, the door is open, I still cannot reach the other side?`
`"...That's right.`
` You already have your hands upon the door.`
` Come, open it with all of your strength.`
` And read the characters written on the door."`
`".........Open it...`
`with all my strength.`
` ...Read the characters...`
`written on the door..."`
`Strain your eyes.`
` ......See through to what lies further beyond the epitaph written in the notebook...`
`"...The "beloved home of old" definitely won't betray our expectations.`
` ......The only past that Father held dear was his years as a boy."`
`That's right......`
` Then what about the "sweetfish river"?`
`There are several rivers where they swim, and it's dubious whether there was one very near the place that Father lived.`
`...If we start wondering which river that's home to sweetfish is closest in a cartographical sense...`
`things will quickly get vague and we won't be able to pin it down...`
`"......Didn't you say it yourself?`
` You said it didn't have to be a river with water flowing down it.`
` ......If the word sweetfish is too complicated, why not forget it forever...?"`
`"Think of a river.`
` A river.`
` Linking it with a "family tree" wasn't a bad idea.`
` Try thinking about how to link a river with something else along those lines......"`
`......Not a river?`
` Even though the sweetfish can't swim in it if it isn't a river?`
`Oh, but maybe "sweetfish can swim in it" means it joins up with the ocean......`
`My husband did say that, despite being river fish, they go out into the ocean... ...............`
`.......................................`
` ...............With the ocean.`
`........................No,`
` ...but,`
` .........`
` ......Huh...?`
`"......Did you notice?`
` But that's just a faint memory.`
` There should be a book archive somewhere around here.`
` If you investigate, you can make sure."`
`......If that's the "sweetfish river".........`
` .........And if the key might be a six‐character word...`
`.....................Is the key really resting in that river?`
`I, I don't know, I don't know.`
`{n}...Anyway, I have to search in an atlas...`
`But, even if I know that, I don't know {i:from what} I should take the six characters...`
`"......You really don't know?`
` Think deeply.`
` .........We're too smart for our own good, so our thoughts are inflexible."`
`"Don't think of it like it's something as grandiose as "The Riddle of the Epitaph", but like it's a child's puzzle.`
` ......Men are always children, no matter how old they get.`
` Even if Father has advanced into old age,`
` that doesn't change the fact that he is essentially a child inside his heart."`
`".........Throw away your awe of Father.`
` ...Think of this like it's a worthless, infantile puzzle game, like the ones Maria suddenly brings up on the boat."`
`......Puzzles.`
` ......Worthless, infantile.`
`........................`
` .....................Huh, .........ah.`
`.........I'm sure that was, ...what was it, ......umm, umm......`
`...I'm sure, if my memory isn't wrong, ......that was probably, umm...`
`No, I don't have to rely on my vague memory.`
`{n}I should be able to figure that out immediately too by searching in the archive.`
`".........We've probably already realized the answer.`
` ...All that's left is to research whether that's correct or not."`
`"Come, Eva.`
` Let's go to the archive and make sure no one notices.`
` ......There, we should find a mountain of thick books that didn't fit in Father's study.`
` ...I'm sure that we'll find a book that answers our question.`
` .........Quickly.`
` This is our first and last chance in our life to have our dreams made true."`
`When Natsuhi tried to lay a blanket over her, Eva suddenly jumped up.`
`"...I'm sorry.`
` I seem to have woken you."`
`"......Eva.`
` If you're sleepy, don't overdo it.`
` You rest first."`
`"Th‐......thank you.`
` I'm just going to the lavatory for a bit to wash my face."`
`"You should take it easy and rest.`
` ...Your health'll take another bad turn, you know?"`
`"I said I'm fine, really!`
` I'll be right back."`
`Leaving only those words behind, I left the lobby at a brisk pace.`
`The lobby was partitioned off by a door, so as soon as I went into the corridor, they could no longer see me.`
`......The archive was next to the servant room.`
`Father always owned a vast book collection,`
` but after he started to become engrossed with his occult hobby, his library of those kinds of books grew even larger,`
` so that the normal books suitable for a normal study had been forced out as his study overflowed.`
`This archive was where those normal books were stored.`
`They were all stiff books for intellectuals, like complete volume sets of encyclopedias,`
` but that was very convenient for me now that I was investigating something.`
`I entered softly, ......and just in case, I checked the room with my gun readied, making sure that there were no suspicious people there.`
`Then I locked it from the inside.`
`I actually wasn't thinking that the murderer might be hiding somewhere.`
`...What scared me was my fear that one of the siblings might hear what I was investigating.`
`My heart had started jumping......`
`{n}...I had been half‐asleep until a short time ago, so I hadn't been able to realize how significant this thing I had realized was.`
`But as I started to become aware, ......my heart started feeling like it was about to explode.`
`".........I...wonder if any of the other siblings have realized this......"`
`I don't think Krauss and Rudolf will realize.`
`......But I don't know about Kyrie.`
`She has extraordinarily good intuition.`
`.........And I don't know about Rosa either.`
`"Rosa is as dim as the others.`
` She always has been, and ridiculously so."`
`Really...?`
` I think she was wise enough to make you think she was dim, so that she didn't earn herself unnecessary malice.`
`".........Here it is.`
` ...I wonder if we'll find it in this one."`
`I pulled the book out, and flipped through the pages......`
`"...............Oh.`
` .........This is...`
`......`
`a "sweetfish river"...?"`
`I see...`
`This is what the sweetfish river means.`
`......Don't dawdle around, research further.`
`"Y‐yes, I know...`
` As you travel down it, you will see a village ({ruby:sato:{p:0:里}})...`
` {ruby:sato:{p:0:里}} is an older word for {loghint:machi:town} or {loghint:mura:village}, right?`
` But it's a densely populated area... There's any number of those..."`
`Why have you stopped thinking?!`
`If you don't like it, why not quit forever...?`
`Why not just hand over the Ushiromiya headship to Kyrie forever?!`
`"I, ...I don't want to...`
` I will become the head.`
` ...This is my first and last chance to do that...`
` ......What is {i:village}?`
` What does it mean?!`
` Is there a village if you go down this "river"......?!`
` ............ah, .........`
`aaaaaaaahhh......!!"`
`......In {loghint:sono sato:that village}, look for the {loghint:kishi:shore} {loghint:futari:the two} {loghint:kuchi:speak} of.`
`......It's a "shore" ({ruby:kishi:{p:0:岸}}).`
` Understand?`
`"Uh, ...*gulp*...`
` I, I, I understand...!`
` Shore, ......shore.........!"`
`All those pieces that I hadn't been able to understand at all were...`
`...right before my eyes, starting to...`
`...snap,`
` snap into place, all by themselves......`
`I couldn't even remember to close my open mouth.`
`{n}...My throat grew completely dry...`
`Is it......really alright for this to be the answer?`
`{n}R‐really?`
` Really...?!`
`"...But this isn't six characters at all.`
` ......I'm absolutely sure that this is the answer, but this doesn't reach six characters at all...!"`
`Did you stop thinking again?`
` In that case, think of a way you could read it with six characters.`
`If you can't think of one, then research it.`
`......There has to be an answer.`
` You must not doubt that.`
`If you can't believe that, why don't you cry yourself to sleep, and then just give up and die forever...?`
`"............One,`
` two,`
` three,`
` four,`
` five,`
` six...`
` ......Oooh,`
` ...s‐`
`......`
`six characters...`
`"`
`"......I,`
` ......I found it.`
` ...This is...`
`......the Golden Land's...`
`k‐`
`......key.........!!"`
`Yes.`
` That is...the key to the Golden Land.`
` ......The key...to our childhood dreams.`
`......The only keyhole to stick that key in...is that place.`
`That...is definitely what offers the sacrifices.`
`You get it now...right...............?`
`"Uuu, ............uuuuUUUgghhHAAaaaaa...!!!"`
`".........This way?`
` ......That means go this way, right............?`
` They are......inviting me to go this way, after all........."`
`......!!!`
`My heart leapt.`
` ...Because there, ............gaping wide, ......was the opened mouth of eerie darkness.`
`"Wh‐.........what is this...`
` What is this......?!"`
`When I strained my eyes, peering into the darkness, I saw something that looked like a light switch.`
` ......In addition, there was a switch with open and close written on it.`
`I resolutely pushed the switch for the lights,`
` and rough lights almost like you'd find in a coal mine or something flickered on sporadically,`
` making a staircase that stretched underground come hazily into vision...`
`It was creepy how it now looked even more gloomy with the lights turned on.`
`Other than the light switch, there was also a switch with open and close written on it.`
`...I could probably open and close it with this, but if I was unlucky enough to find that the open part was broken,`
` I might be closed up in this creepy underground area for all eternity...`
`So for the time being, I didn't touch the open/close switch,`
` ......and as I readied my gun again, I slowly went down the stairs.`
`Because the ceiling was very high, it didn't feel cramped.`
`{n}On the contrary, it felt as though a cool breeze was blowing upwards, and I even sensed a spiritual presence from the eeriness of it...`
`With my gun at the ready, and carefully staring forwards, ......I continued descending the stairs......`
`The walls, the stairs, the lights, ...all of them were very old‐fashioned.`
`{n}...It may be beyond doubt that this had been made at the same time that the mansion had been constructed on this island.`
`There were cracks in the ceiling, and water clung to the walls, constantly dripping down.`
`That water fell into a gutter that had been set up alongside the stairs, then quickly and silently flowed into the underground darkness.`
` It was as though it was telling me to go faster...`
`The staircase turned back on itself a number of times.`
` It was hard to tell how far underground I'd gone, but I thought it to be much deeper than one floor.`
`And eventually, ............a rough, metal door showed itself.`
`And there, characters had been written in a dark red paint.`
`{n}...They had probably been written a long time ago.`
`— {p:1:On the tenth twilight, the journey ends, and you shall reach the Home of the Gold.}`
`My heart, which was already about to explode, jumped about even more as soon as I read those deep‐red characters...`
`There's no mistake...`
` This is the last stop.`
`{n}.........Father's......Golden Land...!!`
`I calmed my throbbing heart, somehow regained my composure, and readied the gun again.`
`...But since, in the end, I couldn't open the door with my gun held in both hands...`
`......I lowered the gun, carefully erased my breath, and opened the door......`
`"..................I‐......isn't this......inside the......?!"`
`My first impression when I saw the room...`
`...was to question whether it might have been connected to one of the rooms in the mansion.`
`Yes, this place had exactly the same atmosphere about it as the forbidden VIP room on the second floor.`
`But this was underground, so there were no windows.`
`{n}There was only the solemn light of a grand chandelier.`
`But the quality of the interior, dimly lit by the faint light,`
` was more than enough to take your breath away.`
`A bed with a canopy, and a rocking chair that looked like it would be very comfortable to sit in.`
` An extravagant sofa and carpet.`
`The room was like a dream every girl yearns for at least once...`
`And yet, since it was an underground hidden room with no windows,`
` it actually felt more like it could be the hidden house of a witch.`
`I had never swallowed the legend of {f:5:Beatrice}, witch of the forest.`
`However, ......if you were shown this room,`
` ......it certainly would become hard to doubt that she actually had existed,`
` and had lived in here.`
`".........Is someone...`
`..................there...?"`
`Although I was dumbfounded by this room, I cautiously,`
` ...no, timidly kept my gun raised, and searched the interior.`
`And......in the center of the room, I found it.`
`"...............Eee—..............."`
`My gasp came out strangely, as though a bunny was being choked.`
`...I mean, ......after finding something like this,`
` ...no one would have any words other than that stupid voice...`
`"It's here......`
` ......I‐......it's really here.........`
` ......Father's......gold......!!"`
`On the opposite side of the canopy bed, it was piled up in a massive heap...`
` A mountain, a mountain of gold ingots!!`
`Of course, they weren't piled up carelessly in a way that would damage the dignity of this room.`
`A beautiful scarlet satin weave was laid on the mountain of gold,`
` creating a beautiful three‐colored mix between the red, the gold, and the black of the deep darkness...`
`It was as though, when the witch slept on this bed,`
` the gold would be a respectful chamberlain waiting on her.`
`Nobly, refinedly, gracefully, beautifully.`
`{n}It was piled there with an imposing and yet ceremonious air...`
`I tried to grab a single gold ingot and was surprised at its weight.`
`{n}......It was probably about ten kilograms.`
`......Just this one ingot would easily be worth ten million without a doubt.`
`The Ushiromiya family crest, the One‐winged Eagle, was lightly imprinted on it.`
`It was hard to tell whether it had worn away, or whether the impression had been made carelessly in the first place,`
` but it was certainly the crest of the One‐winged Eagle.`
`Just how many ingots are piled up here?`
`Just by roughly multiplying both sides, and multiplying that by the height, it must surely come to over several hundred.`
`My mind's already blank... I can't calculate it properly.`
`{n}......Even a conservative count would put it easily above a billion yen.`
`"Well, of course... Of course it would be...`
` ...I mean, it's ten tons of gold...`
` At the current value, it's more than 20 billion yen of gold...`
` I, ...I found it, ......before anyone else, .........I found it!!`
` Ahaha, wahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha, ahah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`In front of the mountain of gold, I spread my arms and looked up at the ceiling.`
`{n}A laugh without a trace of dignity flowed out from my entire body.`
`I had no intention at all of laughing in such a weird way,`
` ...but I just, I just couldn't hold back the happy feeling that flowed throughout my entire body.`
`......That older brother of mine probably wouldn't accept his loss just because I had found this gold.`
`...But from now on, there would be no changing the fact that I had been the one to find the gold...!`
`To steal the headship of the family, I would still probably need some subtle tactics.`
`But after everything I've gone through until now, that's a completely trivial problem.`
`Even if I lose out on the inheritance of the Ushiromiya family and everything...`
`{n}...this 20 billion yen's worth of gold is now mine and mine alone!!`
`"Hahahaha, a‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!!`
` There was a time when I thought of money as such a worthless thing.`
` I thought, there are so many things in this world that you can't buy with money."`
`"...But now I understand that that's just a lie!`
` It was just an excuse that have‐nots make for themselves!!"`
`"With this mountain of gold before me, I've finally realized something so obvious...!!`
` I can give birth to all the happiness in this world by melting this gold!`
` With this money, my husband's company is fine now.`
` We will always be happy as a family.`
` And I can even leave a vast amount of money to George...!!"`
`"The rest of the relatives will eventually be ruined and disappear.`
` At that time, George will use this gold, and revive the Ushiromiya family's lost honor,`
` just like Father did...!!`
` There will be no room for anyone to argue then.`
` ......George is the true successor of the Ushiromiya family!!"`
`It happened!!!`
` My wish was granted!!`
`That dream I have wished for ever since I was born into this world as Ushiromiya Eva, has been granted completely in this very moment...!!`
`My husband and I will be happy for all eternity.`
` And I can also give my only son, George, eternal happiness!!`
`There's no way I'll waste it on foolish pleasures!!`
`{n}My older brother has chewed up the Ushiromiya family, but George and I will revive it!`
`And that means that we truly have succeeded the headship of the Ushiromiya family!!`
`"I succeeded...`
` I did it, ...honey......George...`
` ......I, ......your mother......finally succeeded...`
` ......After this, we won't be threatened by anyone...`
` Uuuhhu, uuuuUUuuuUUugghhuhuu!!"`
`That's right, after this, never again will we be smothered by sad nights.`
`Congratulations, me.`
`Congratulations, Ushiromiya Eva.`
`......Right here, right now, the sad half of our life has had its heart's desires granted.`
`"It's all thanks to you...`
` I was blessed with this chance because of your magic.`
` Because of that chance, I was able to make it here...!"`
`...Thank you.`
` But my magic couldn't have been granted if we both didn't believe in each other.`
`So it isn't just the power of my magic.`
`This is our victory.`
`So, congratulations,`
` "us".`
`"Thank you, me...`
` Thank you, Ushiromiya Eva...`
` ......I'm so glad I didn't give in before now.`
` I'm so glad I didn't drown in sorrow and forget to keep struggling..."`
`".........No, this is my magic.`
` Our magic!`
` Your magic was the real thing.`
` {f:5:Beatrice} the witch of the forest is nothing more than an illusion.`
` {i:You} are the real witch, who can use real magic.`
` ......That's right.`
` Right now, {i:you} are the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!"`
`Eva decided to leave that place for the time being.`
`{n}And when she climbed the stairs again, trying to leave this secret place...`
`......She saw a creepy, swaying human shadow blocking her path, and her dreamlike state was blown away.`
`".....................Who's there?!"`
`For an instant, ...she believed that the true master of this room, the real {f:5:Beatrice}, had appeared.`
`It seemed that the other person was also holding a gun.`
`{n}The two of them were pointing guns at each other.`
`And eventually, they each realized who the other was...`
`".........Rosa.........?"`
`"...Nee‐san...`
` .........What are you doing in a place like this...?"`
`"I could ask you the same.`
` What business do {i:you} have in a place such as this?"`
`"......I shouldn't have given you that hint, Nee‐san.`
` If I hadn't, I definitely would have been the first to reach this place.`
` .........Too bad."`
`It seemed that Rosa knew where this staircase went,`
` and what was waiting ahead of her.`
`"That's rich.`
` .........Coming from someone who arrived here after me."`
`".........I racked my brains too much over the sweetfish river.`
` The sweetfish part didn't really matter that much at all, did it?"`
`"That isn't true.`
` It was an excellent hint, if you ask me.`
` Well, of course, maybe there was no need for it to be sweetfish.`
` ...But when I heard that sweetfish are fish that go out into the sea, I was able to figure it out."`
`"......What is inside?"`
`"Why not see with your own eyes?`
` It definitely won't betray your expectations."`
`"........................`
` ......Don't be afraid, Nee‐san.`
` I never had any interest in who became the head.`
` I don't even care about the Ushiromiya family name.`
` ......Honestly, Krauss nii‐san always did throw his weight around, saying that he was going to be the head,`
` so I actually feel good about you stealing the position from him."`
`"............Are you serious?"`
`"Of course.`
` I am the outsider of the Ushiromiya siblings.`
` ......Even if Father had named me as the next head,`
` there's no way my brothers would accept that.`
` I try not to have such naive dreams."`
`"........................"`
`"Let me see too.`
` The proof of your victory, Nee‐san.`
` ......As long as I receive the proper portion that we agreed upon as siblings,`
` I plan to actively accept you as the true victor in this "game"."`
`"............If you shot me, then you would have this gold all to yourself, right?"`
`"It's the same for you.`
` If you shot me, this gold would all be yours."`
`"......................................."`
`For a tense while, the sisters pointed their guns at each other.`
`{n}Eventually, after they sized up the glint in the other's eyes, they lowered their guns.`
`...Eva removed her finger from the trigger, and held the gun upside‐down.`
`It was a position that she couldn't quickly shoot from.`
`{n}When she saw that, Rosa held hers the same way.`
`"......That's right.`
` That plan of shooting the other and having all the gold to ourselves is fascinating for both of us."`
`"...But if one of us suddenly disappeared on this island while it's isolated by the typhoon, there would be a huge uproar.`
` ......If we hid the corpse here, it probably wouldn't be found easily, but that isn't for certain."`
`".........No matter how many billion yen's worth of gold is on the line,`
` it isn't worth the risk of committing murder.`
` In the end, that would become a weakness for Krauss nii‐san and the others to squeeze all the money out of us with."`
`"I agree.`
` ......Considering that Nii‐san or Rudolf could have been the one to show up here,`
` ......it may have been a blessing in disguise that it was you.`
` ...I trust you the most of all the siblings."`
`"............Thank you.`
` I also trust you the most of the siblings, Nee‐san."`
`"...................................."`
`"............I want to see the gold too."`
`"Do you?`
` Now I also want to see it again.`
` Even though I saw it with my own eyes, it still doesn't feel real.`
` ...Unless I see it together with you and check once more that it actually exists,`
` it feels like the gold will turn to fog and disappear."`
`Eva started descending the staircase once more.`
`{n}......However, she didn't carelessly expose her back to Rosa.`
`Likewise, even though at a glance it looked like Rosa had lowered her guard, she definitely didn't show any signs of carelessness.`
`......And they reached that room of the witch once again.`
`{n}Rosa also gasped, made speechless by the vast amount of gold...`
`......Rosa and Eva walked absentmindedly through the rose garden.`
`They had left the guesthouse secretly, so they had to be careful when they returned as well.`
`They had to regain their sense of tension soon.`
`"......Congratulations, Nee‐san."`
`"Thank you."`
`"You decided it, didn't you?`
` Fifty percent goes to the bearer of the title of successor to the head.`
` ......It sure did work out well for you.`
` That doesn't refer to Krauss nii‐san anymore.`
` ...So your share is now fifty percent along with a quarter of the rest, for a total of 12.5 billion yen."`
`"Isn't that an incredible share?`
` ...I'm satisfied with 2.5 billion.`
` Rudolf nii‐san won't complain either.`
` Krauss nii‐san will probably be the only one to complain."`
`"......Yeah, you're right.`
` ...After all, Nii‐san is the practical manager of Rokkenjima.`
` And since the gold was on these premises,`
` even though I was the first to discover it, things might get complicated if I don't handle it skillfully."`
`"It won't get complicated.`
` We covered this and every other eventuality in excruciating detail in last night's discussion, didn't we?"`
`"............I wonder if it will really go that smoothly.`
` I've already completely gotten over my excitement.`
` How we regulate everything from here on is the real problem."`
`"...That is a problem for the new head of the Ushiromiya family.`
` You should enjoy that problem, Nee‐san.`
` It has nothing to do with me."`
`"Hmm, sharp words..."`
`"......I'll support you as the second person to find it.`
` So please at least give me the early payment we decided on.`
` I'd like 150 million yen by March."`
`"Yes, that's fine.`
` ......If you support me, I can graciously pay you that much.`
` I am not Nii‐san."`
`"Anyway, why don't we go and shock Nii‐san and the others?`
` Even if we cover up the actual location, I want to see Krauss nii‐san's shocked face as soon as I can."`
`"...............`
` ............Wait a second, Rosa.`
` Wait a while before telling everyone about it."`
`"..................Huh?`
` ...Why?"`
`"...You idiot, isn't it obvious?`
` ...This is that haughty Krauss nii‐san and that sly Rudolf we're talking about.`
` Even if we announce it eventually, it's still too early now."`
`"Unless we carefully investigate how we should move things along first,`
` it's possible that all of the gold we've finally found will be snatched away by Nii‐san."`
`Eva had thought she had just said something completely obvious.`
`...So when she saw Rosa's expression suddenly cloud over, she was a little surprised.`
`"......What are you unsatisfied about?`
` You know well what kind of people those two are."`
`"...............`
` Nee‐san, that's against the rules."`
`"What do you mean?"`
`"......Didn't we make a rule that whoever found the gold would announce it immediately?`
` If you hesitate, the foundation of the rules will be destroyed,`
` and that could lead to something worse in the future.`
` ...With Krauss nii‐san as crafty as he is,`
` that violation of the rules will complicate things later."`
`"Don't be stupid.`
` This is Nii‐san's island.`
` And that gold just now wasn't cash.`
` We're talking about the liquidation of a vast ten‐ton mountain, you know?"`
`"It will take a significant amount of time to carry it off and turn it into cash.`
` And that will only work in Nii‐san's favor, since he has practical control over this island.`
` Don't you even realize that?!"`
`".....................I don't like searching each other for weaknesses like that.`
` I just want to clearly lock in my 2.5 billion portion."`
`"Of course, if you were to give me 2.5 billion in cash right now,`
` whatever you did next would be up to you.`
` But until I have my share in my own pocket, I will follow the siblings' rules."`
`"You're so naive...`
` You don't understand Nii‐san's craftiness at all!"`
`......It wasn't that Rosa didn't understand the craftiness of her older siblings.`
`In that sense, Rosa more or less understood Eva's caution.`
`But in her heart,`
` she couldn't clear away her even greater suspicion that Eva wanted to keep all of the gold to herself.`
`......Because she knew that Eva was at least as crafty as her other siblings, if not more.`
`In other words, by quickly informing the siblings of the gold's discovery,`
` Rosa wanted to put a stop to any chance Eva had to keep the gold all to herself...`
`"..................`
` ......Rosa.`
` Sorry, but at least listen to me this once."`
`".........Are you saying that if I don't listen to what you say, you won't be able to prepare the 150 million?"`
`"........................`
` ...That isn't the way I wanted to say it.`
` ...But if you really need that money, it's more realistic to support me.`
` ......If you talk to Nii‐san and Rudolf, even that natural portion of yours might disappear.`
` You don't want that, do you?"`
`"........................"`
`For a while, a severe expression that she had never shown to her sister before rose to Rosa's face.`
`There wasn't even a trace of her restraint as a younger sister.`
` ......There was just the ruthlessness,`
` no, the seriousness of a single human arguing about a vast sum of wealth.`
`Eva made light of it, chuckling.`
`"......Dear me.`
` A frightful murder has just taken place, and the culprit still may be on this island...`
`how careless we must be to stand around here talking like this."`
`"I'm sure it's just the servants' farce.`
` No murder ever occurred on this island."`
`"......Oh?`
` So you really do think that?"`
`"It can be clearly explained by the manner of the six deaths.`
` The locked room involving those six definitely couldn't be created by a crime from the outside."`
`"......Doctor Nanjo said that they were all dead, but that was also a lie.`
` This is all a complicated act that Father plotted.`
` All of the servants are just pretending to be dead.`
` ...A murder never occurred in the first place.`
` There's no way that there's a murderer prowling around."`
`"...Huh...`
` I'm surprised that you would notice that.`
` You looked fairly frightened, so I hadn't thought that you realized that much."`
`"......I'm a person who can read between the lines in that kind of situation.`
` Thanks to you, I've been well trained."`
`That's right.`
` Before we realized it, the servants had "died", and the members of the Ushiromiya family had become the only ones on this island.`
`And after Nanjo had proclaimed the "deaths" of the servants,`
` and the relatives had begun to discuss the riddle of the epitaph, he had disappeared off upstairs as though he was in the way...`
`"Everything...`
`was an act to get us to challenge that epitaph.`
` ......And that's exactly why...`
`you need to proclaim that you are the victor, Nee‐san."`
`"There's no way that burnt corpse is really Father.`
` ......He prepared a corpse with the right number of toes from somewhere, and deliberately burned it in that horribly morbid way."`
`"......I'm sure he's hiding somewhere, watching to see how we'll behave.`
` ...I'm sure he already knows that you have reached the Golden Land, Nee‐san."`
`"......And that's why you should proclaim soon that you are the winner.`
` I'm sure Father will appear out of nowhere and proclaim that you are his successor while clapping his hands."`
`"........................"`
`"...Well, still.`
` ......I have to pester you for 150 million,`
` so I can't work against you in anything."`
`".........So you'll listen to what I say, and be quiet about this to Nii‐san and the rest...?"`
`"...................................."`
`"......Make your position clear.`
` ...Rosa."`
`"...............I want to tell them.`
` We just made that rule last night.`
` We shouldn't just throw that away."`
`"Of course, I will announce it in front of the siblings.`
` ...However, I want to make very sure of the situation first.`
` Carrying out ten tons of gold, converting it into money,`
` and distributing it fairly."`
`"......Until I can affirm my ability to carry those out without Nii‐san getting in the way, I want some time to think.`
` I only want to hold off my announcement until then.`
` .........I'm definitely not keeping it secret because I want it all for myself."`
`"..................`
` ...You'll definitely announce it to everyone sooner or later, right?"`
`"...Yes, of course.`
` Even I want to rub it in Nii‐san's face as soon as I can."`
`".........About how much time will you need to "think"?"`
`"I won't know that until I've thought about it."`
`"............Would one night be enough?"`
`"I can't promise you that it will take only one night...!"`
`"Out of respect for you as the successor to the head, I will support you for one night.`
` ......This year's family conference will end tomorrow morning, when the typhoon passes and a boat comes to get us.`
` ...That's right, when the seagulls cry.`
` ......I will remain silent until then."`
`"If you think that you need more time to think after that, ...let's talk about it again at that time, alright?`
` .........I will support your position...`
`{i:as much as possible}."`
`"......You......really are cunning, aren't you?`
` ...I'm surprised.`
` Were you always this strong‐willed?"`
`"......It's true that women become stronger when they have a child.`
` I realized that in myself when I had Maria."`
`"...............`
` Alright.`
` I thank you for your cooperation for the time being.`
` ...We can talk about tomorrow when it comes."`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` ......I believe that you will be a fair‐minded successor to the head, who wouldn't even think of taking all of the gold for herself."`
`"...Isn't that obvious!`
` ......I will split the gold evenly among the siblings as we agreed."`
`No way. {i:I} found this.`
`Because I, because we solved the riddle of the epitaph!`
`So this gold is all mine...!!`
`"I won't give it up to anyone!`
` I am the head of the Ushiromiya family!`
` I am, {i:I} am!!"`
`In a loud voice, the witch inside Eva claimed exclusive possession of everything.`
`{n}...Of course, that didn't come close to reaching Rosa's ears, and it probably didn't even reach Eva's, either.`
`"......Mm.`
` I shall acknowledge that.`
` You are the true head of the Ushiromiya family, chosen by the witch's epitaph.`
` Now, I shall acknowledge that upon my name."`
`"...Y‐`
` .........you are.........`
` That outfit...`
`you couldn't be...`
`......really...`
`{f:5:Beatrice}......?"`
`Maybe {f:5:Beatrice} was happy that Eva had called her by her own name.`
` She cackled pleasantly.`
`In concert with that laugh, gold butterflies rose up as though a storm of gold dust had broken out in the room,`
` and the room shone the color of gold...`
`"Indeed.`
` I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......*cackle*cackle*, there is nothing that should frighten you so.`
` I am praising your exploits.`
` ...Truly excellent.`
` Imagine that you would spectacularly solve that riddle of the epitaph...`
` It is worthy of my admiration...!"`
`"...You were the one who sent that letter?`
` So I'll succeed all of the gold and the Ushiromiya family inheritance, right...?`
` You wrote that in your letter.`
` And I overcame that challenge...!"`
`"Mm.`
` I shall acknowledge it.`
` Now, all of this piled‐up gold, and everything of the Ushiromiya family, is for you to do with as you please.`
` For as of this moment, you are already the Ushiromiya family head."`
`"R‐......really?`
` It's true, right?`
` Right?!"`
`"Do not become agitated.`
` I am openly praising you.`
` As proof, I shall grant you this."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} took a ring off of her own finger,`
` and held it out to Eva.`
`She fearfully accepted it,`
` ......and realized that it was a ring.`
`"......C‐`
`......could.........`
`this be............"`
`"Mmhm.`
` It is the proof of the Ushiromiya family headship, returned to me from Kinzo: the Golden Ring."`
`"From now on, it is yours.`
` You may put it on your finger and display it high before your siblings.`
` None should doubt that you have now succeeded the Ushiromiya family inheritance."`
`Eva stared closely at the ring.`
`...It certainly wasn't a fake.`
` ...Without a doubt, it was the real thing.`
`She, who had dreamed of receiving this ring someday,`
` and who had stared fixedly at it countless times, could say that for certain.`
`This ring...`
`had now designated her as its new owner,`
` ......and had been handed over to her......`
`And...`
`timidly...`
`she put it on the middle finger of her left hand...`
`In that instant, ......she felt a deep emotion welling up inside her that she had never felt before.`
`Her mind grew blank.`
` Both eyes opened wide.`
`{n}That ring...was on her own finger.`
`{n}Not in a dream, in reality............!`
`"That ring is surely also pleased.`
` Because it was able to come to you, who had dreamed of putting it on your finger for so long."`
`"......The ring...`
` ......Father's`
`......ring...............!"`
`"How many nights have you dreamed of putting that on your own finger as you have now done?`
` ......The strength of those feelings became your magic and made that reality.`
` Now, you are worthy of calling yourself a true witch."`
`"............Wh‐...who are you?`
` ...Are you really......{f:5:Beatrice}......"`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` I am the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}!`
` The Ushiromiya family alchemist!"`
`"Following my contract with Kinzo, I now pass everything on to you.`
` ...All of the gold I entrusted Kinzo with.`
` And all of the wealth he built up through that.`
` And the honor and inheritance of the Ushiromiya family.`
` And I will pass on my power, and the title of the Endless Witch."`
`"......A witch's...`
`...title......"`
`"I will pass on all of my magical power, and the titles of the Golden Witch and the Endless Witch.`
` ......Following my Predecessor, I will hand over my name, {f:5:Beatrice}, along with those titles.`
` ......You may now call yourself by that name!"`
`Eva gulped.`
` The chandelier light, which had seemed dim, now felt too bright.`
`"By my name, I shall now carry out the succession of the Golden Witch...!"`
`The instant that {f:5:Beatrice} made that proclamation, a golden brilliance buried everything,`
` ......and changed it into a majestic space that looked like a throne room.`
`In the throne room, there was a crowd of {f:5:Beatrice}'s minions and brethren, as well as countless gold butterflies,`
` celebrating this first succession ceremony in a thousand years.`
`And there was {f:5:Beatrice}, in the throne that only the Endless Witch was permitted to sit in, holding a golden staff,`
` reigning with a dazzling dignity.`
`Without being ordered by anyone, Eva automatically kneeled, hanging her head...`
`A goat attendant respectfully offered {f:5:Beatrice} a golden staff modeled after the One‐winged Eagle.`
`After {f:5:Beatrice} stood up and received that staff,`
` she lay the tip of it on Eva's shoulder and spoke.`
` It was a proclamation one thousand years in coming.`
`"Ushiromiya Eva.`
` You have spectacularly solved the riddle of the witch's epitaph, and reached this Golden Land.`
` ......I praise that accomplishment,`
` and hand over all of the Endless Magic as well as the titles of the Golden and Endless Witch."`
`"From this point on,`
` you may take my name, {f:5:Beatrice}...!`
` Come, raise your face.`
` Then stand and accept this staff...!"`
`"I, ......I am most grateful..."`
`Eva stood up dizzily and took the magic staff from {f:5:Beatrice}'s hand.`
` Her hand was trembling slightly.`
`As soon as she grasped that staff...`
`{n}......she was wrapped up in the brilliant sparkle of gold.`
`{n}As though gold butterflies were flowing out from inside of her.`
`In the instant she succeeded the Golden Witch, Eva felt something in the depths of her soul be reborn.`
`To describe it in a word, it was energy.`
`{n}Energy with a gold color.`
`It felt as though she had been half asleep ever since she was born,`
` ......and had now awoken for the first time in her life.`
`For the first time in her life, she felt her true eyes inside her eyes open.`
`".........Mm.`
` A fitting and beautiful outfit for the Golden Witch."`
`"Come, show yourself to all of these people.`
` Show them that you are now the new witch...!"`
`Eva, ......no, the new {f:5:Beatrice} turned around timidly.`
`When she did, the witch's minions, which filled the vast throne room,`
` honored her with a wild applause that sounded like the roaring of the sea......`
`"Come, everyone.`
` Replace all of the portraits of {f:5:Beatrice} with the new {f:5:Beatrice}!`
` Offer up words of celebration for the new {f:5:Beatrice}...!!"`
`"New {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Congratulations on the succession of the Golden Witch.`
` ...I hope that you will become able to stand on your own as a noble Golden Witch, and as the Endless Witch."`
`"Y‐.........yes, ...I will do my best..."`
`"I expect a composure fitting for the Endless Witch from you, unlike your naughty predecessor.`
` Hoh‐hohohohoho."`
`"Masteer, we're in the middle of a serious ceremony, so please, enough of thaaat..."`
`"Congratulations on the succession of the Golden Witch.`
` New {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"......I am called Ronove.`
` I am one of the 72 demons permitted to serve the Golden Witch.`
` From now on, I will always be at your service.`
` If you are ever inconvenienced in the slightest, please let me know at once."`
`"......Th‐......thank you......"`
`"Ronove is rude but reliable.`
` If you speak to this man of anything that confuses you in your new days as a witch, he should be able to help you."`
`".........And, predecessor {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama,`
` it is a shame that I was not permitted to serve you further, even though we have finally been reunited like this."`
`"......These last thousand years have been very entertaining for me.`
` I deeply thank you."`
`"Mm.`
` ......One thousand years with you wasn't boring.`
` ...Please, take care of the new witch."`
`"Yes.`
` If that is the final order of the predecessor {f:5:Beatrice},`
` ...I, Ronove,`
` shall certainly carry on your wish."`
`"Thank me, 'kay?`
` I signed as your reference for the succession of the witch, you know?`
` So basically, if I hadn't signed, you wouldn't have been able to become the witch.`
` So thank me a little, alright?!"`
`"This is the Witch of Certainty, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` The recommendation of a witch from the Senate was required for your succession as an Endless Witch.`
` Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} recommended you, and became your guardian."`
`"Th‐......thanks......"`
`"......Heyyy, Beatoo!`
` This kid isn't grateful enough!`
` I wanna stop recommending her!"`
`"Being a reference is not a thing to take lightly.`
` If you've signed, then you must take responsibility."`
`"Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} is also the Witch of Certainty.`
` ......The Witch of Certainty prefers to make fate firm, to create a fate of Certainty.`
` She took a great liking to your efforts up to today, and held them in the highest regard."`
`"Well, an unfortunate childhood, unrewarded effort...I can sympathize juuust a bit with those, that's all.`
` It's not like I felt sorry for you or anything, don't get so full of yourself!`
` Tsuun!"`
`"......From my point of view, your succession, well, it's more of a coincidence than a miracle.`
` You wouldn't have been worthy of my recommendation."`
`"*cackle*.`
` This is Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` She is a very hard‐to‐please person.`
` Still, you could say that just having her participate and celebrate is very fortunate."`
`".........I only came because this is a rare event, unseen in a thousand years.`
` And I heard that there would be some delicious alcohol."`
`"New {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` Please, allow us to greet you as well."`
`"Huh, ...ah, ...I'm pleased to meet you..."`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory formed a line side by side.`
`{n}The eldest sister, Lucifer, took a step forward and kneeled.`
`"These are furniture who serve me.`
` As a gift in celebration of your inheritance, I will send them to you."`
`"......After you succeed the Golden Witch, you will need to perform the ritual for your own resurrection.`
` The Seven Sisters of Purgatory perform an essential role in that ritual.`
` ......They're a bunch of miscreants, but they serve their purpose.`
` Have them do whatever you wish."`
`"We will always be by your side, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` Please order us to do anything you wish.`
` We will certainly show that we can accomplish our task...!"`
`Even after that, various nobles and minions visited and offered words of congratulation for the new witch.`
`As she responded to them confusedly,`
` she felt as though she was getting light‐headed due to lack of oxygen.`
`......She couldn't tell if this was something real or unreal.`
`But there was just one thing she could understand.`
` The feeling of achievement at being permitted to call herself the Golden Witch.`
`...That alone was a truth she could definitely understand...`
`"............What......is all this?`
` Of course, I'm not going to swallow this story, ...but what on Earth does it mean?!"`
`"Auntie Eva is the new {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` Are you saying she's become a witch?`
` ......What the hell...!!"`
`"I am also surprised.`
` Imagine that someone would be able to solve that riddle.`
` ......However, that is the rule.`
` I must follow it, and pass on the position of Golden Witch and my name."`
`"It is hardly something to be surprised about.`
` Milady wrote that rule in a letter and announced it at the beginning.`
` ......Eva‐sama was the first to be successful.`
` That is all there is to say."`
`"......{f:5:Virgilia}, are you there?!"`
`"Yes, here I am..."`
`"What does this farce mean?!`
` Even if this depiction of strange witches showing up one after another is some of her bullshit...!`
` ......Isn't this like Auntie Eva has become a witch?!"`
`"Calm yourself.`
` She has simply received the title of "Golden Witch", and might call herself that in the future.`
` ......This succession ceremony is, without doubt, nothing more than that performed according to that child's "interpretation".`
` Don't fall for the same move again."`
`"Th‐...that's right...`
` That whole grand ceremony was all phony.`
` But it's at least a fact that Auntie Eva solved the riddle of the epitaph.`
` ......And at the same time, that means that she inherited the Ushiromiya family headship."`
`"......And by obtaining ten tons of gold,`
` ......it means that Auntie Eva might as well call herself the "Golden Witch"...is that it...?`
` Damn, making things as complicated as ever...!!"`
`"...Dear me.`
` Is a boorish {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} unable to comprehend the grandeur of this ceremony?`
` ......Oh, well.`
` Being unable to read between the lines is what makes you {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` I pity you, but I do not blame you."`
`"Damn it...`
` Don't look at me like you feel sorry for me...`
` .........Still, for the time being, there's something I need to check."`
`"And that's regarding this younger version of Auntie Eva,`
` ...in other words, the definition of this new {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......What the heck {i:is} she?!"`
`"Even if I tell of it, you will just persist in your disbelief in magic and witches, will you not?`
` So there is nothing in particular for me to explain.`
` You may believe that things are as you think they are."`
`"......The way I think things are...?!`
` Then, then how should I interpret this...?!"`
`"For now, grasping it as a visualization of a different being inside Ushiromiya Eva may not be a hindrance, I believe."`
`"...Of course, you cannot blindly accept it, but it is probably appropriate for you to think that way now."`
`"............In, in other words, I should think of Auntie Eva and her as the same person?`
` ......Damn, ...this is starting to feel bad..."`
`"With that being the case, from now on, my name is not {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Because I have passed it on to Ushiromiya Eva."`
`"......Which means that I am nameless!`
` Battleerr, isn't there some name that is fitting for me?`
` I shall take your recommendation!`
` Isn't there a name that's refined, full of elegance, and make it a little cute if you can...!"`
`"...Just "Beato" is good enough for you.`
` There's probably enough of a difference between Beato and {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"Mh...muu.`
` Stay as Beato, is it...`
` It doesn't feel odd, but it's boring for some reason.`
` Muu."`
`"Pu ku ku ku ku...`
` They say the temperature of black tea and a woman's heart are difficult in any time period."`
`".........Battler‐kun.`
` In any case, handle what is to come with composure.`
` Compared to when this child was {f:5:Beatrice},`
` now that we can tell her apart from Ushiromiya Eva, the situation is advantageous to us."`
`"......And it's exactly because of that,`
` ...that I like it even less.`
` ......What is she thinking of?`
` That Beato........."`
`Over there, Auntie Eva,`
` who had the figure of her younger days and who now possessed the name {f:5:Beatrice}, had a long line forming of witches wishing to bless her.`
`It was like a witch's coronation.`
`Countless gold butterflies flapped their wings, directing this fantastical, gold‐sparkling space.`
` They were all praising her.`
`As I stared from the distance,`
` I looked at the {f:5:Beatrice} given new life, who had a slightly embarrassed smile on her face.`
`......Her expression, which had been hesitant at first,`
` seemed to be full of a happiness that she had finally become aware of.`
`In that expression, there wasn't a trace of the madness that had led her to that insane laugh before the gold.`
` There was only the innocence of relishing her joy.`
`Since I deny witches, I couldn't accept her as she showed that joyful expression at her witch succession ceremony...`
`......However, as I watched that innocent smile,`
` ...it made me feel like I wanted to celebrate her, just for now.`
`The moment when a strong effort is successful and rewarded is always beautiful.`
`Auntie Eva, who had always yearned to succeed the head, and had worked hard since she was young without being rewarded,`
` ......had spectacularly taken hold of the chance given to her by the riddle of the epitaph, ...and had finally gained that position.`
`How divine is the smile of a person whose childhood dreams have been granted?`
`I definitely won't accept witches.`
`{n}But, ......Battler put his hands together, making a small sound.`
`Clap. Clap.`
`......It didn't reach her ears, ...but it did celebrate her.`
`".........Congratulations, Auntie Eva."`
`You solved the riddle of the epitaph masterfully, and before anyone else.`
`{n}It's your victory without any complaints.`
`............I won't accept all that about the Golden Witch and so on, but I will accept you as the new head of the Ushiromiya family, and I will celebrate you honestly.`
`"...............Hmph."`
`As though lured by Battler's applause, Beato also clapped.`
`...It was a slightly odd scene.`
` Because Battler and Beato, who opposed each other, were standing next to one another, applauding for the same person.`
`"I'm not clapping for a witch.`
` ...I'm clapping for all of Auntie Eva's efforts up until now."`
`"I am too.`
` I am offering Eva my sincere congratulations in applause for the tremendous accomplishment of solving that epitaph."`
`".........Hmm.`
` ...I don't like the fact that I'm clapping with you.`
` ...But, well, I won't worry about it for now.`
` ...I guess it doesn't hurt to clap with you every once in a while."`
`"Mmhm.`
` It isn't bad once in a while.`
` ......Still, it is fun to applaud.`
` Even though it was Eva who achieved it and not me, for some reason, I'm starting to feel happy too."`
`"That's because celebrating someone means the same thing as empathizing with their joy, and sharing in it."`
`"I see.`
` Then, I must even be sharing this irrational happy feeling with you.`
` ......Since we are a pair of enemies trying to make each other submit, it is an odd experience."`
`"Well, ......just for now, let's have a truce and clap, alright?"`
`Beato laughed impishly, playing around and applauding even louder,`
` as though eagerly trying not to lose to Battler as she clapped.`
`Battler went along with her, and clapped even louder.`
`And when he did, as though he had ended some kind of ceremony, everyone present put their hands together in loud applause, and highly praised the newly born {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`It was just as though Battler's and Beato's applause had been the final thing needed for her succession......`
`Rosa returned to the lobby.`
`It was still her time to rest,`
` but her expression made it look as though she couldn't sleep deeply with all this tension.`
`"......You have to force yourself to lie down.`
` It'll get tough for you later on at this rate."`
`"Thanks for caring.`
` I just can't sleep.`
` ......I went and took a shower at least, so that will be enough.`
` The next person can rest."`
`"What about you two, Kyrie‐san? Rudolf‐san?"`
`"......What will we do, Rudolf‐san?`
` Will we rest?"`
`"You can rest if you want.`
` I'll stay awake.`
` That's the only manly thing I can do right now."`
`"Then I'll stay awake.`
` Staying awake with my husband is the only womanly thing I can do right now."`
`"......*giggle*.`
` You two truly are close."`
`"As are you two.`
` *giggle*."`
`"It seems that Eva and Hideyoshi‐san are out cold.`
` It appears as though, unlike Rosa, they can't fight against their age."`
`As though in response to those words, the door to the hall clunked open.`
`Eva and Hideyoshi returned from the guest room.`
`"That's none of your business.`
` ...Oh, Rosa, are you still alright without sleeping?"`
`"What about you, Nee‐san.`
` Why not take it easy and rest?"`
`"............I just can't get to sleep.`
` After taking a shower, my drowsiness faded away.`
` Rudolf, Kyrie‐san, you can rest if you want."`
`"Yeah, thanks.`
` For now the sentiment alone is enough.`
` Why don't you go first, Aniki?"`
`"How kind of you.`
` But I cannot rest first.`
` That is the most I can do as the oldest brother."`
`"Do not worry, the two of us will be awake until the very end."`
`"......*giggle*.`
` .........More importantly, Eva nee‐san,`
` are you alright?`
` You look a little pale."`
`"......Come to think of it, you're right.`
` ......Hmmm?`
` You're feelin' a bit hot, you know?"`
`Hideyoshi put his hand up against Eva's forehead.`
`{n}...It seemed that Eva wasn't feeling her best.`
`"Told you so.`
` ...That's what happens when you break your daily cycle at your age.`
` ......Is it a cold?"`
`"...Natsuhi.`
` Could you call Doctor Nanjo down?"`
`"Y‐yes."`
`"...I'm fine, you don't have to make such a big deal out of it.`
` I have some medicine, so I'll be fine.`
` ......I tend to get a fever when I'm tired.`
` Don't worry."`
`"......Nee‐san, take it easy, okay?"`
`".........Thank you.`
` ...When my siblings gather without me around, I get the feeling everyone is talking behind my back.`
` ...It's a persecution complex from long ago.`
` Sorry, okay?"`
`"...............I won't say anything.`
` I would never say something bad about you when you're away."`
`"......................................."`
`"......What is it?`
` Nee‐san, you've been acting strange for a while, you know?`
` Shouldn't you get a little rest now?"`
`"............You're right.`
` I started thinking about {i:raising money by March} and it made my headache even worse."`
`"That isn't good.`
` Rest.`
` ...I'll restrain myself so that your headache doesn't get worse.`
` I've had a bad headache myself for a while now."`
`".........Thank you.`
` ......Well then, I'll count on what you've said and rest for a while."`
`"What's up, Eva?`
` Why so bent out of shape all of a sudden?`
` ......Sorry 'bout this... Please let us rest a bit longer.`
` Sorry... Sorry..."`
`After putting his hands together as though praying and apologizing several times,`
` Hideyoshi went after Eva, and left the lobby.`
`"............I don't like this atmosphere.`
` Everything's so strained."`
`"That's no surprise.`
` ......There was a murder early this morning.`
` And since then, we've been eating canned food and holding guns.`
` ...It's natural that we would start to build up stress."`
`"I wonder if the kids up there have also built up stress.`
` ......I'm worried about Maria.`
` She tends to get irritable in times like this."`
`Just then, they heard the sound of wild footsteps from upstairs.`
` The guesthouse wasn't a cheap building, so if they had been any normal footsteps, there was no way they would have heard them.`
`It was like the sound of someone stamping their feet in frustration.`
`And not a moment later, in addition to the apparent sound of feet running out into the upstairs corridor,`
` they could hear Maria calling "uu‐uu‐uu" over and over again, sounding displeased.`
`Rosa grabbed her head, ruffled up her hair, and voicelessly moaned in anguish...`
`The adults conscientiously turned their backs to her, pretending not to notice.`
`The noisy clamor came downstairs and flew into the lobby.`
`It was Maria, who was sobbing; the other children, who had come down with her; and Nanjo.`
`...In other words, everyone on the second floor had come downstairs because of Maria's tantrum.`
`Rosa couldn't hide her dizziness at the scale of the annoyance her daughter was bringing to everyone...`
`"S‐sorry, Auntie Rosa...`
` We tried to calm her, but she just wouldn't listen..."`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"...What is it, Maria?`
` Could you be a little more quiet?`
` Everyone's looking."`
`"It's that rose of hers from the rose garden...`
` She suddenly started saying that she was worried about it."`
`"......I think she's half asleep.`
` She suddenly woke up, and started going on about how worried she was for that rose.`
` .........Maria‐chan, calm down.`
` That was just a dream..."`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` That was {f:5:Beatrice}'s and my rooose!!`
` So if I don't take care of it, {f:5:Beatrice} will get mad at meee!!`
` It might be broken again!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"......Haah...!`
` ...Listen, I'm {i:telling} you to quiet down a bit, {i:alright}?!?!"`
`The children were taken aback by the sudden rise in the tone of Rosa's voice.`
`But Maria's crying just grew louder, and her tantrum just grew fiercer.`
`"R‐...Rosa‐san.`
` You mustn't scold a child so bluntly without attending to what they say...`
` ...In times like this, it is good to give them some warm milk or something."`
`"......Is there any here?"`
`"The milk we served in place of breakfast earlier was the last..."`
`"Doesn't anyone have a sedative to use on kids...?`
` You know, those silver pill things?"`
`"Of course I do!!`
` Yes, I'll search for them now and make her take them!!"`
`Without hiding her displeasure, Rosa grabbed her handbag that she had placed on the sofa and fished around for the medicine.`
` ......It seemed that she had brought some child‐use sedatives for Maria's tantrums.`
`She found it and tipped the bottle into her palm, but it seemed to be empty.`
`{n}Irritated, Rosa shook the bottle several times, but that didn't change the fact that nothing was in there.`
`...All the while, Maria's crying was growing more and more intense...`
`Meanwhile, Eva was lying in bed, covered by the bedding.`
`Hideyoshi returned from the washroom, folding a handkerchief soaked in water.`
`"......My, this is one nasty fever...`
` ......I'm sure it's the poisonous air at this family conference that got you...`
` ......For now, you can forget all about the other relatives.`
` ...Alright?"`
`As Hideyoshi spoke to her kindly, he set the soaked handkerchief gently on Eva's burning forehead.`
`Eva rested her own hand on top of his.`
`".........Your hand...`
`feels wonderfully cool."`
`"If my hand feels wonderful, your fever must be pretty bad.`
` No worries, the medicine will start workin' soon.`
` Plus, my hand is a magic hand.`
` If I just put my hand up against your forehead like this, see,`
` any fever will melt right away."`
`"You're right.`
` ......Your hand always makes my fevers fade..."`
`"Yep.`
` No need for a doctor when you've got my hand.`
` Don't worry and close your eyes.`
` ......The fever will fade right away thanks to my magic..."`
`"Yes, I know...`
` ......I can feel your magic."`
`Hideyoshi was about to say "they call that the placebo effect", but he stopped.`
`......If Eva said that she could feel magic from his hand, then that was alright for now...`
`"............I wonder if magic really exists."`
`"Yeah.`
` Sure does.`
` Only those who believe can tell, though.`
` ...There's actually a lot of magic like that out there in the world."`
`"...If magic is real, ......then I wonder if witches are real too."`
`"Oh?`
` You mean that witch of the forest, {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` She probably does exist for those who believe.`
` Just like God.`
` Won't show himself except in front of those who strongly believe."`
`"...............You know,`
` ...long ago, I was able to use magic too."`
`"Oh?`
` That so?`
` Then you've been a witch once too."`
`"......You know, whenever I had a dream that I wanted to come true no matter what,`
` if I wished strongly and tried hard, it came true every time.`
` ......With my magic, my grades were always the best, and I even became the student council president, and got into the university I wanted by my own ability.`
` ......Everything I wished for was granted."`
`"That's right.`
` Your magic was always a thing to be reckoned with...`
` You're definitely a witch.`
` ...And you work harder than anyone.`
` ......I know aaall about it."`
`"...............You know,`
` ever since I was a kid, the whole time, there's been another me inside myself, who always supported me.`
` ...And that other self was a witch."`
`".........I didn't believe in {f:5:Beatrice}, the witch of the forest.`
` I always believed that if a witch of Rokkenjima did exist, it was the witch inside my heart.`
` .........I am so grateful to that witch inside myself.`
` ...I'm always so grateful......that she let me meet up with you..."`
`"............You're always too timid when you get sick.`
` ...Don't say anythin' for now.`
` ......I'll stay like this the whole time, until your fever has gone down, okay?"`
`"......Yeah.`
` ......No matter what,`
` ......don't take your hand away.`
` .........Somehow, I...`
`...feel like I'm becoming something that isn't myself,`
` ......and it's been scaring me for a while now.`
` ...I get the feeling that the witch inside of me...`
`...was provoked by {f:5:Beatrice}, and is growing stronger and stronger.`
` ...Somehow, it feels like she's going to swallow me up."`
`"It's alright.`
` As long as I'm with you, there's not a thiiing to be afraid of!`
` Remember the time we went to that dangerous country and the whole bus was robbed?`
` I repelled 'em!"`
`"...Honey, you just handed over your gold watch and begged them to go away.`
` ......It was pretty lame, ...but it was cool..."`
`"............This hand...`
` ...Please don't move it away, no matter what...`
` ......Not even if I fall asleep.`
` ......And even if something creepy sneaks inside,`
` ...protect me..."`
`"Yep, leave it to me.`
` ......So stop worryin' now and get some sleep.`
` The medicine and my magic will start workin' real soon..."`
`Eva finally calmed her heart and closed her eyes.`
`......Just then, there was the sound of a door being opened violently from the direction of the lobby.`
`It seemed that Maria was having a tantrum, and screams of "uu‐uu" could be heard,`
` along with Rosa's rebuking yells.`
`...That was probably very annoying to listen to.`
`{n}Or maybe it was taking a toll on her headache.`
`{n}Eva moaned as though in pain, and buried herself in the covers.`
`It was easy to guess what was happening.`
` Maria had probably had a tantrum for some reason, gone down to the lobby,`
` and when Rosa had scolded her for it, they had started arguing.`
`...And then, the looks of the rest of the family had been too much to bear, so Rosa had taken Maria out into the corridor.`
`......Hideyoshi had no desire to interfere with Rosa and Maria's problems.`
` ...But just for now, since Eva's condition was so bad, he wanted them to take their ruckus somewhere else.`
`"...Wait just a second.`
` I'll go ask them to keep it down."`
`".........C‐come back quickly..."`
`"Don't worry, I won't leave this room."`
`Hideyoshi removed the chain, opened the door, and stuck his face out into the corridor.`
` He immediately met Rosa's gaze.`
`"...Everythin' alright, Rosa‐san?"`
`"I'm sorry, did all this noise wake you up...?"`
`"Uu‐uu!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`"...Maria‐chan, sorry.`
` Auntie Eva isn't feelin' well, and she's tryin' to sleep.`
` Could you quiet down a smidgen...?"`
`Maria's tone didn't change after being asked by Hideyoshi.`
`She kept whining and repeating "My rose, my rose".`
`Rosa slapped Maria's cheek, lifted her up while covering her mouth,`
` and carried her off towards the entrance, trying to at least put some distance between her and Hideyoshi's room.`
`...They would still probably be clamorous for a while yet, but he had at least warned her.`
`{n}Hoping that Rosa would show her capabilities as a mother, Hideyoshi closed the door.`
`".........Is Maria‐chan crying again?"`
`"Looks like it.`
` ...It's tough for Rosa‐san too.`
` ......When you think about that, our George is almost too good to be true.`
` We should be grateful."`
`"...............You're right.`
` .........nn,`
` ......hand."`
`"Oh, sorry, sorry.`
` ......Here you go, it's the magic hand."`
`He put his hand on Eva's forehead again.`
`......Maybe there really was magical power in that hand.`
`A truly peaceful look rose to Eva's face, and bit by bit, she began to drift off into the land of sleep.`
`As he had promised, Hideyoshi kept his hand on her forehead......`
`By the entrance, with her hand still against Maria's mouth, Rosa was at a loss at what to do next.`
`She had been unable to withstand everyone's gaze in the lobby,`
` and had yelled at the children to go upstairs, before dashing out of the lobby.`
`And when she went out into the corridor, Hideyoshi had told her that she was being too noisy.`
`Where should I go now?`
` ......Where should I take this child who's having a tantrum?`
`She felt as though she was about to cry in frustration...`
`As Maria kept struggling in an attempt to scream, Rosa put her mouth up to Maria's ear,`
` and tried to persuade Maria in as calm a voice as she could manage.`
`".........Maria, you really want to see the rose that much...?"`
`Maria nodded her head several times, moaning "uu‐uu".`
`"...Why do you want to see the rose that much?`
` I'll listen to you, so will you tell me quietly?`
` I'll hit you if you scream."`
`"............My rose...`
` {f:5:Beatrice} revived it.`
` ......It might have broken again...`
` ...I'm worried about that...`
` Can't sleep until I make sure..."`
`It seemed that she was still making a fuss about that marked rose from yesterday.`
`Rosa felt her headache throbbing again,`
` but she was at least a little relieved that Maria had now stopped her screaming.`
`"Anyway, everyone is having a hard time right now.`
` So don't bother Mama and everyone else.`
` ......You can worry about that rose all you want tomorrow, when it stops raining.`
` So just listen to me for now...!"`
`"No.`
` ...No no no no.`
` My {f:5:Beatrice}'s rose...`
` ...Uuuu..., uu‐uu.`
` WaaaaaaAAaaaahh!!"`
`Rosa reflexively covered Maria's mouth.`
` She had spoken a little too harshly, and had gotten her agitated again...`
`Rosa realized that it was partly her own fault and clicked her tongue in self‐hatred.`
`But Maria thought that was directed at her, and her crying grew even fiercer...`
`"...I'm begging you, be quiet...`
` What can I do to make you stop crying?`
` What should I do to make you listen to what your Mama says?"`
`"........."`
`Abruptly.`
` Maria stopped crying unnaturally fast.`
`{n}......Then she turned around, and muttered.`
`"............`
`If I can see my rose, I'll be quiet until tomorrow."`
`"Really?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ...If we go to the rose garden and see my rose, I'll behave."`
`".................."`
`"I mean it, Mama."`
`"...................................."`
`If it would keep Maria quiet for the time being,`
` Rosa thought that even going out into this wind and rain would be a small price to pay.`
`She did think it might be a bit reckless.`
`{n}............But in the end, no murder or anything of the sort had actually occurred.`
`All of that clamor since this morning had been a farce set up by Kinzo.`
`If you carefully thought about that chain of locked rooms, it communicated more clearly than anything that it was all an act by the victims themselves...`
`"......Will you really listen if you get to see the rose?"`
`"Yeah.`
` I mean it, Mama.`
` ......Kihihi."`
`"................................."`
`"Ouch."`
`Rosa didn't overlook that creepy laugh, and lightly hit Maria with her fist.`
`{n}And she shrugged, as though giving up.`
`"......Fine.`
` You have one look and be satisfied.`
` Understand?"`
`"Yes, Mama.`
` I promise.`
` ......Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi."`
`Once again, Rosa tested the weight of her gun.`
`......It's alright.`
` It's only a farce.`
`{n}There was never a murderer on this island in the first place...`
`"Damn it, wait, Auntie Rosa...!!`
` Are Auntie Rosa and Maria......the sacrifices for the second twilight?!`
` Damn it damn it damn it, someone, notice them, tell them to stop!!`
` What are those guys in the living room and us kids doing?!!"`
`"Hmm.`
` They are being considerate of Rosa's pitiful relationship with her daughter, and are forcibly changing the subject.`
` The group you are in went upstairs, and are talking about something else while watching TV."`
`"Goddammit!!`
` Someone, notice them!`
` Who's the closest, is it Uncle Hideyoshi?!`
` Please, notice that those two are leaving through the front door, aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaahhh!!"`
`"It won't reach, it won't reach, *cackle*!`
` Don't disturb their precious time together.`
` Fuhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!"`
`Hideyoshi kept talking kindly, his hand on Eva's forehead.`
`He didn't notice that Rosa and Maria were going outside through the front door at all.`
`In that case, there was no way that the others in the lobby, which was even further away, would notice either.`
` And the cousins' room upstairs was even worse...!`
`"Why are you so panicked?`
` On the first twilight, didn't you defeat me with that bold move, saying that the culprit died in an accident on the first twilight?"`
`"...Doesn't that mean that there is no longer a culprit on this island...?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*, what is there to be so worried about...?"`
`"Shut up, I can see right through you!!`
` Someone stop them, those two'll be killed!!`
` Someone, stop theee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeem, aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaahhh!!"`
`......There was no way that Battler's voiceless scream would reach Rosa or Maria.`
`The two of them could be seen in the rose garden.`
`The rain was still awful, but fortunately, the wind had died down a little.`
`......No, maybe that wasn't fortunate.`
` Because if the wind {i:had} been a little fiercer, Rosa would surely have hesitated to go outside...`
`"......Uu, uu, uu...`
` ............Here it is...!"`
`Maria found her own rose with the gold lace and stared at it lovingly.`
`Rosa had accepted with the promise that Maria would only have one look at it,`
` but she didn't want Maria to complain that it hadn't been enough later on,`
` so she decided to go along with her until she was satisfied.`
`......She believed that there wasn't a culprit,`
` but if by any chance she was mistaken, they were now in an extremely dangerous position.`
`Rosa realized that faintly herself.`
`If things got bad, she would throw away her umbrella and ready her gun.`
`{n}...Keeping the innocently rejoicing Maria in the corner of her eye, Rosa gazed warily in all directions.`
`....................................?`
`{n}......Were her eyes just tired?`
`Even though no one should have been there, she thought she saw something glitter in the dark rose garden with all its wind and rain.`
`...Gold‐colored......?`
`{n}It had to be her imagination.`
`Because, to Rosa, it seemed as though gold butterflies were dancing through the rose bushes...`
`"......Are you alright, Eva...?`
` ...Just take it easy...and should I call Doctor Nanjo after all...?!"`
`"I...... ......I'm alright...`
` ......Don't take your hand away......`
` ...I'm begging you, ......don't take your hand away......"`
`Eva was breathing wildly.`
` Beads of sweat were appearing on her forehead.`
`It certainly was true that she had stayed up all night last night, and that things had been rough since early this morning.`
`{n}It wasn't odd that her body wasn't keeping up.`
`......Even though he understood that,`
` Hideyoshi suspected that Eva's sudden fever was the sign of some serious illness.`
`Several times, Hideyoshi suggested to call Doctor Nanjo, but Eva resisted firmly,`
` ...pleading with him and saying that it was even more important that he didn't take his hand away...`
`"I understand...`
` But you've gotta have Doctor Nanjo look at you by lunchtime.`
` If you can promise me that, I'll stay here the whole time, grippin' your hand.`
` Tightly, like this."`
`"......Thank you...`
` ......I'm fine...`
` The magic of your hand......will definitely make this fever subside......"`
`Even as she said that, Eva's harsh breathing didn't improve in the slightest.`
`"......Haah,`
` ......haah,`
` ......haahh...`
` ......Don't let go,`
` ...don't let go......`
`haah,`
` ......haahh,`
` ............aaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaaahhhh!!"`
`"Wh‐............who's there...?!"`
`She saw an umbrella moving from beyond the rose bush.`
`Rosa threw away her umbrella and wildly lifted her gun...`
`When she did, the figure beyond the bush......showed itself.`
`".........Uu?`
` ......Auntie Eva............`
` .........?"`
`"...You scared me.`
` So it was you, Nee‐san?`
` ............Do you have some business?`
` ...Do you want to continue our earlier discussion?"`
`"..............................`
` ...Yes, that's right.`
` Our discussion about Father's gold."`
`"......Please, restrain yourself in front of Maria.`
` I've been keeping my promise, okay?`
` I won't get in the way of your scheming."`
`"...............Scheming?`
` What's that?"`
`".........Whatever you're thinking, that's up to you.`
` I have no desire to get in the way.`
` So please, not in front of Maria.`
` As long as I get my share, that will be enough."`
`"Your share?`
` Heheheheh, ahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha."`
`Eva started laughing in a creepy voice...`
`{n}Rosa was startled, but Maria stared blankly.`
`.........Then Maria said just one thing.`
`".........Uu......?`
` ............Wait,`
` ............who are you...?"`
`"Hahahahahaha, ahhahhahahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!`
` Your shaaare?!`
` Who would give that to you...?!`
` All of that is mine!`
` It all belongs to me, the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}...!!!"`
`"UaaaAAAAAAAAaaaAaaaaaa—!!"`
`"Eva! Are you alright, Eva?!`
` Eva!`
` Eva!!"`
`"Hold on...!!`
` Don't let go!!`
` So that I don't get taken away by someone who isn't me...!!`
` Keep holding on to my hand...`
` Don't let gooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooooo...!!!"`
`"When did you ever work hard?!`
` You never worked hard for anything!`
` You were always hiding in our shadows!`
` You always ran about from shadow to shadow without fighting,`
` and yet, you really think yourself qualified to ask me for the Ushiromiya family gold...?!"`
`"All of that is mine!`
` It's all mine and mine alone, as the head of the Ushiromiya family and the new Golden Witch, successor to the name of {f:5:Beatrice}!!"`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...............It's {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` Mama, {f:5:Beatrice}!"`
`Frolicking around, Maria jumped at her mother in ecstasy.`
`{n}...Rosa treated Maria coldheartedly and raised her gun high.`
`"......Y‐......you're Nee‐san, right......?`
` ......You are Nee‐san, right......?"`
`"Wrong.`
` ...I am no longer the one who was your sister."`
`"Then who are you?!!`
` Are you going to say that you're {f:5:Beatrice}?!`
` That's impossible!`
` You died 19 years ago!!!"`
`"Yes, you were definitely dead, after all, I clearly saw that your head was smashed.`
` I can remember your insides flowing out like it was yesterday!`
` How could you be alive and right here noooooooooow?!?!"`
`"The concept of death does not exist for a Golden Witch.`
` The names of the Golden Witch and {f:5:Beatrice} will be handed down for all eternity."`
`"Maybe the {f:5:Beatrice} you knew met with death, but that name is mine now...!`
` Therefore it is endless!`
` The concept of death does not exist for {f:5:Beatrice}!!"`
`"......How pitiful, Nee‐san...!"`
`.........That gold has caused you to lose the distinction between fantasy and reality......`
`"I said I'm not your sister anymore.`
` ......Well then, as the new {f:5:Beatrice}, I have been tasked with my own resurrection ritual.`
` .........Ronove!`
` What should I do?!"`
`"That is up to you.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, you already have the power to make whatever you think reality.`
` You should grow used to it if you use it a little."`
`"......You worthless former sister.`
` You should consider it an honor to have been selected as my first sacrifice as a witch.`
` On the second twilight, I'll tear apart the two who are close, with my own hands...!!"`
`The first thing the new {f:5:Beatrice} wished,`
` ......no, the first magic she tried to use, was to surpass the limitations given to humans.`
`...In particular, gravity.`
`She wanted to become fully aware of her transformation into a witch by being released from those shackles.`
`As the witch and Rosa stayed as they were...`
`......The ground retreated all by itself, into the distance below them.`
`{n}By now, their feet were no longer attached to the ground.`
`Rosa finally realized that the ground hadn't retreated into the distance below her,`
` but that she and the witch had been sucked up into the rainy sky.`
`"............huh...?`
` ...............Eeeek...?!"`
`"Wh‐.........whoooooooooaaaa...... Awesome......!"`
`To humans, shackled by gravity, there is nothing more unnerving than not having their feet on solid earth.`
`......However, to {f:5:Beatrice}, who had learned the joy of being released from gravity as a new witch,`
` it was enough to cause her whole body to shake with delight.`
`"......Hey, Rosa.`
` Do you remember, long ago, when we were small, when we used to talk about what it'd be like to become witches and fly around the sky?`
` ......It's come true, you know?`
` I became a real witch and granted it for you."`
`"S‐............Stop it, .........wake me from this dream......"`
`"You said it.`
` You said that you flew through the sky in your dream.`
` And you also said that you hadn't wanted to wake up.`
` You were even mad at me for waking you, right?"`
`"......Don't worry.`
` You won't wake up this time, alright?`
` Heheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheheh!!"`
`Come, dance with me in the vast, rainy sky.`
`Didn't we wish together to fly like seagulls in the sky,`
` and escape the cramped and boring island of Rokkenjima...?`
`Now, I'll make that dream a reality for you.`
`That is why I want to share this joy with you, and no one else...!`
`"Ahhahaha ahhahahahaha!!`
` Isn't this so fun, Rosa, isn't this so fun?!!`
`"`
`"Take a look, below you!`
` Look at how small our mansion is.`
` I wonder how much time we spent in a place that small.`
` ...Now I'm especially shocked at how cramped and tiny it is."`
`"So feel.`
` Enjoy.`
` Rejoice...!`
` That power we yearned for, the power to move through the sky at will!`
` Come on, let's dance, Rosa!`
` Through the rain, through the wind!`
` Let's fly around like we're dancing!`
` The lightning will shine on us and bless us!!`
` Ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`The witch and Rosa were like leaves fluttering around in a whirlwind.`
`{n}As the rain pounded upon every part of their bodies, as the lightning occasionally shone upon them, they shook with the joy of being released from the ground.`
`...However, it was only that way for the witch.`
`{n}Rosa was holding onto her head, voicelessly screaming over and over.`
`"Stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiitt!!`
` Please no mooo{-}o{-}o{-}ooore, let me dooo{-}o{-}o{-}ooown!!"`
`"......You're right, it's more fitting for {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s to crawl on the ground.`
` Then why not go back there?"`
`A slightly displeased expression rose to the witch's face when she realized that her own joy was not being shared.`
` And she decided to listen to her former sister's request.`
`"............?!`
` .........aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaAAA{0}A{0}A{0}AAHHHHH!!"`
`The whirlwind that had been making Rosa dance around grew weaker, then stopped.`
`In other words, Rosa was once again bound by the restrictions of gravity, as a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
`......Following the laws that were originally correct, Rosa began to descend towards the ground upside‐down.`
` No, she began to fall.`
`"Oops...`
` That's right, if I don't take her down the right way, this is what happens!"`
`The witch hadn't intended to send Rosa plummeting.`
`{n}But she still wasn't used to using magic.`
`After plummeting about 100 meters into a rose bush,`
` as a very, very natural result, Rosa died instantly.`
`But the witch hadn't intended to kill her.`
`{n}So she willed for Rosa not to die.`
`When she did, gold butterflies coiled about Rosa's body, reviving that life just as the witch had wished.`
`Rosa's body, which had laid out a radial carpet of fresh blood, rapidly returned to normal.`
`The broken and crushed bones returned to normal.`
`The torn and smashed flesh returned to normal.`
`......How easy it is to break things in this world, and how difficult it is to fix them...`
`Anyone can take a life.`
`But no {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} can revive a lost life!`
` By surpassing the irreversible, one proves that they have surpassed {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.`
`......This surely gave her a much, much greater realization that she was a witch than flying through the sky had.`
`".........Awesome...`
` I can even revive......an ended life......!"`
`"Of course.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, you are already an Endless Witch."`
`"......To live and to die.`
` To bring to life and to kill, all of it repeated endlessly.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, as the Endless Witch, you are the queen who controls that cycle of life and death."`
`"Ahaha, aha.`
` One time, I dropped a goldfish bowl.`
` The fragile and beautiful bowl broke, and I couldn't put it back together again.`
` That cute pop‐eyed goldfish would never swim for me again after it landed on the floor."`
`".........No matter how much I cried, the servants shook their heads, saying that broken things and dead things could never be revived."`
`"...That's when I learned, you know?`
` You mustn't break things, you mustn't kill people.`
` After all, you can't fix them!!"`
`"So...if you {i:could} fix them...`
`...then you wouldn't get in trouble for breaking them, right...?`
` Haha, ahahahaha, .........awesome...`
` Awesome, awesome, awesome...!!`
` Ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaah{0}hahah{0}hahhah{0}hahhaha!!"`
`For a while, the witch became intoxicated with how terrible and wonderful the power she had succeeded was.`
`Her laugh was pure, innocent, and also cruel.`
`".........Uuuuuunnghh, ......au......"`
`Even though Rosa had been revived, she let out a cry of anguish at the pain from her fall.`
` The witch landed in front of her and held out her hand.`
`"Hahahahahahaha, sorry about that, Rosa.`
` I didn't think flying in the sky would be so much fun.`
` Sorry, I'm really sorry."`
`"And I didn't know that {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s could die so easily.`
` But I've brought you back to life, so you're fine now.`
` So get up, okay?`
` Play with me some more, okay?`
` *giggle*giggle*, ehehehaaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`What were those dreams you told me about when you were a kid...?`
` Go ahead and tell me about all of them without holding back.`
`As I am now, I can make anything come true, no matter how absurd...!`
`I can let you drown in a ocean of jelly!`
`{n}I can swallow you up in a mountain of cake!`
`{n}I can even make you grow butterfly wings and let you fly around the garden!`
`I'll do them one after another, let's start with the ocean of jelly, okay...?!`
`"S‐stop,`
` ...............urgg!!"`
`Rosa was once again thrown high into the rainy sky.`
` However, the sky wasn't filled with raindrops, but with drops of orange juice.`
`When she looked down, Rosa had to doubt her eyes.`
` The rose garden had disappeared, and the ground spread out beneath her was like a pastel‐colored jigsaw puzzle.`
`......It was from the dream she had talked about when she was young, an ocean of jelly.`
`The black part was coffee jelly.`
` The red was strawberry,`
` the yellow was pineapple,`
` the green was melon.`
`What was the white part, apple, perhaps...?`
`.........Did Rosa even have the time to think something like that?`
`Rosa fell towards that multi‐colored ocean.`
`......And sank deep into a grape‐flavored purple sea.`
`It really was an ocean of jelly.`
` It had no bottom.`
`As Rosa sank, she was shocked to see a school of transparent fish swimming through the grape jelly ocean.`
`They were probably made of grape skin.`
`Then she sank on and on, deeper and deeper, as deep as the Mariana Trench,`
` ......compressed tight by the water pressure of the jelly ocean,`
` as her ribs crushed and crunched, as her spine snapped and cracked.`
`...In the end, she had become a small, frail meatball.`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahaha!`
` What a truly wonderful experience, to drown to death in an ocean of jelly...!!`
` It's a dream no one else can imitate!!`
` I granted it for you, ahhyahyahyahya!!"`
`The instant I snapped my fingers, the meatball that had been Rosa was launched up into the sky.`
`And after being enveloped in a golden brilliance, she returned to her original form.`
`It was as simple and easy as returning dried seaweed to its original form, and anyone could do it.`
` If they were a witch!`
`That vacant look on Rosa's face...`
`had to be because of the joy from having that dream she had given up on as a child made into reality.`
` Definitely. Probably.`
`Next is the mountain of cake.`
`{n}In an instant, the sky was covered, and became patterned black and white like a chessboard.`
`That almost transparent white part was her favorite gelatin cheesecake.`
`{n}The elegant black part was a slightly bitter gâteau au chocolat.`
`They were a ceiling, they were a mountain, ......and those several billion cakes were thrown down towards Rosa.`
`If you piled those cakes up, they would surely be taller than Everest.`
`So they probably weighed...`
`......I'm not too sure, but it was probably heavier than all the cakes across Japan put together.`
`It fell down like a ceiling and swallowed Rosa up,`
` ......so as a very, very natural result, Rosa was crushed to death.`
`In less than a second,`
` her bones broke throughout her body and her insides were all smashed and forced out,`
` spladdasplutslop.`
`And yet still an even greater number of cakes piled up on top,`
` ...and Rosa ended up as a layer of jam wedged between the cakes.`
`She became as thin as a single hair, and was probably smashed out into the area of a tennis court.`
`That world swallowed up by cake was once again absorbed by a golden flash.`
`Then, as though it had all been a dream, Rosa was revived once again.`
`......Of course, it definitely wasn't a dream.`
`{n}She had been revived after dying.`
`By that point, death, which most {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s only have to experience once after they are born,`
` had already been experienced repeatedly by Rosa.`
`In other words, she had gone through that which {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s cannot, the precious experience of dying more than once.`
`"Ahhahahahahahahaha, kyahha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!`
` Isn't this fun, Rosa, isn't this fun?!`
` Next is the butterflies, look...!!"`
`"P‐please, have mercy...... .........aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"No waaay!`
` Let's play more, let's play more...!!`
` Kyahihihiha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`Laughing innocently, she pointed her gold staff at Rosa as she begged for mercy.`
`When she did, Rosa glittered gold and rapidly began to shrink.`
`She shrank down to the size of a real butterfly.`
` Then, gold wings sprouted from her back...and she joined her fellow gold butterflies.`
`However, while a human body could withstand this wind, it was a different matter for a butterfly's body.`
`The gold butterfly Rosa was invited to dance by each gale of wind, and she spun in circles around the rose garden.`
`"No, ...nooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooOO{-}O{-}OOoo{-}o{-}ooOO{-}OOooo!!`
` .........ah—"`
`A gentle bed caught her as she tired from dancing.`
`It was a soft, knit hammock in the shadows beneath the roof of the arbor.`
`...The owner of that hammock lumbered into view, welcoming its rare guest who had wandered in on this stormy night...`
`That owner, which should have been small enough to crush in the palm of your hand,`
` now looked as big as the top of a canopy bed to Rosa.`
`"Giiyaaaaaaaaaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaaa!!!"`
`"Kyahhahaha{0}kya{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!`
` What a klutz, you got caught in a spider's web!`
` Ahhahaha, ahhahahahahaha!!"`
`"This time, it's a dance with a spider.`
` That takes me back, remember the times we'd find a spider's web and play around by throwing pebbles at it?`
` I've heard that spiders don't chew their prey,`
` but insert their venom, and when the insides melt into a sticky soup, they suck it out."`
`"......Hey, Rosa, remember?`
` Remember how we'd throw butterflies into the spider's web on purpose, and play around by seeing how the spider would attack?"`
`"Kyahhahahahahahaha,`
` you don't remember, do you? This happened before you got into grade school...!!`
` You'll be able to see it up close this time, you know!`
` Very close.`
` Kyahihi{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}kyaaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`

`"Interesting interesting, interesting interesting!`
` You feel like laughing too, right, Battleeeeeeer?!"`
`"Stop this bullshit!!!`
` Just STOOOOOOP!!!`
` What's so fun, you're insane, you're insane!!`
` What's so fun about doing something like this?!?!"`
`"Doesn't she look like she's having so much fun?`
` I don't blame her, magic {i:is} fun!!`
` I remember, when I first became able to use magic, I played around so much!`
` ...Yeess, I understand, I understand, I understand that play from the bottom of my heart!"`
`"......I expect I won't be able to share this joy and passion with you, Battler, aah, what a shame, what a shame!!`
` If you accepted me, I'd teach you magic anytime you wanted, you know?!`

`"I want to teach you about it, that joy, that passion!`
` I definitely would like to see the world of magic you would give birth to, just once!`

`"You're starting to enjoy yourself, right?`
` You've started wanting to use magic, right?!`

` Just for you, I'll teach everything!`
` About the joy of flying together in the sky, about the joy of diving together through the sea!"`
`"I will teach you the excitement that you feel,`
` in the instant you surpass the bounds of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s and see how wide your world stretches!`
` Wouldn't that be fun,`
` wahhyahhyaha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`There was no malice in Beato's expression.`
`...It was hard to believe, but she was genuinely enjoying this cruel show.`
`And she thought she was sharing her appreciation with Battler.`
`{n}......Battler was aghast at that vastly...`
`hopelessly different measure of value.`
`"This is unbelievable... There's definitely something screwed up with you!!`
` Stop it already, goddammiiiiiiiiit!!`
` {f:5:Virgilia}, make her stop this insane farce!!`
` What do I have to do?!!"`
`".........We exist outside the board.`
` We cannot touch the board itself."`
`{f:5:Virgilia} shook her head apologetically.`
`{n}...She was one who had already been "killed".`
`{n}Did that mean she couldn't interfere in any way...?`
`As Beato continued to enjoy it in a crazed sort of way, Battler lifted her up by the collar and yelled at her.`
`"Stop it stop it stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!!`
` That's {i:enough}, you goddamn witch!!`
` Are you trying to tell me that's Auntie Eva?!"`
`"That's impossible!!`
` While the Auntie Eva I know may be a bit mean at times,`
` it's completely impossible that she's the kind of person that would do something this cruel!!"`
`"This is all part of your deception!!`
` Don't toy with Auntie Rosa!!`
` Don't toy with Auntie Eva!!`
` Stop this farce RIGHT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!"`
`"But I already said that it's not me playing with Rosa anymore.`
` I told you, that's the new {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"Is it really so cruel that you have to squeal like that?`
` You're also pretty fond of stuff like this, aren't you?!`
` You actually have just a bit of interest in magic and—`
`...ouch.`
` Wh‐what was that—"`
`For the first time, Battler slapped Beato across the cheek.`
`...Beato didn't know why something like that would be done to her, and a stunned expression rose to her face.`
`Battler found that expression even more unforgivable, and he roared.`
`"HUUUUUUH?!`
` You call this {i:interesting}?!`
` What the shit is wrong with your head?!!`
` Go kill yourself!`
` Slice the top of your head off and try looking inside, you'll definitely find that the insides have been completely removed!!!"`
`"Make her stop it right now, make her stop this disgusting farce!!`
` I'll never forgive you!!`
` How dare you do something so cruel!!`
` I've sometimes thought that you're a bit of a funny person, but I'll never make that mistake again!"`
`"You're just a monster who's nothing but cruel!!!`
` Don't show yourself in front of me!!`
` Never again!!`
` I won't accept you, I won't talk with you, I don't even want to look at your face!!"`
`"That get through to you?!!`
` Don't show yourself in front of me!!`
` Just—FUCK—OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOFF!!!"`
`The instant Battler screamed, the power that resisted the witch became a red wall which repelled Beato, knocking her back onto her butt.`
`"......Owowowow...`
` ...What are you talking about, isn't it an interesting show...?"`
`She spoke as though making an excuse, but the person those words were directed at, Battler, was no longer there.`
` His figure had suddenly disappeared into the darkness...`
`...But Beato pouted her lips, and continued trying to explain herself.`
`"......I‐it's not like I completely don't see where you're coming from,`
` ...but this is nothing more than an innocent prank, right...?`
` No matter how she kills, that person will be brought back to life in the end, right?`
` ...Aren't {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s creatures that are fine with anything as long as it ends well......?!"`
`"R‐right, Master?`
` It's not something to get so angry about...!"`
`She was hoping for approval, but {f:5:Virgilia} simply faced her with an indifferent expression.`
`{n}...To Beato, at that moment, even an exasperated face would probably have seemed better.`
`"............I have nothing in particular to say.`
` If you think it is fun, you can keep watching as long as you want.`
` ...Call me when it's over.`
` I will erase my form until then."`
`Following Battler's lead, {f:5:Virgilia} hid herself in the darkness...`
`Left sitting there on her own, Beato didn't have a clue what was going on, and felt like she had been made out to be the bad guy.`
`"..............................`
` ......What's so wronnng?`
` It's an interesting show, isn't it...?!`
` I‐it might be a little vulgar, ......but it's fairly interesting, isn't it...?!!`
` Right, Ronove...?!`
` It's nothing to get so mad about, right...?!"`
`"Pu ku ku ku.`
` ......Something interesting for you, Milady, is not necessarily interesting for Battler‐sama."`
`"Does he really...hate me that much?"`
`"......Well, certainly, we are playing against each other, so it is true we are enemies,`
` ...but is our relationship really so bad that we can't laugh together at entertainment...?!`
` .........Since I applauded together with Battler, I thought I could at least laugh together with him...`
` ......Does he really reject me so much that we can't even do that...?"`
`"...He doesn't have to accept that I'm a witch.`
` Because the point of the game is to compete over that.`
` But still, saying he won't look at my face, that he won't talk to me,`
` ......surely ignoring me is going too far...`
` Am I really hated that muuuuuch......!"`
`"The moves you have made thus far are certainly worthy of hatred, Milady.`
` Even a demon such as myself can slightly understand Battler‐sama's feelings.`
` ......I wonder if you cannot understand that because you are especially thickheaded, Milady?`
` Pukkukukukuku."`
`"Sh‐shut up shut up shut up shut up!!`
` Why don't you disappear too?!!"`
`"Yes, certainly.`
` ......Then, if you would excuse me."`
`Even Ronove hid himself in the darkness, and Beato was left alone.`
`The only one in the rainy rose garden.`
`No one will play with a lonely witch.`
`Because no one would play with her, she was a lonely witch.`
`".....................`
` ......What's going on?`
` ...Why won't anyone play with me...?`
` .........Am I really that weird, that cruel...?`
` ............Someone, answer meeeeeeeeee!!"`
`"Kyahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha, isn't this fun, Rosa, isn't this fun!`
` Hey, how should we play next?`
` Of course, I'll play with Maria too, okay?"`
`"Let's all have a friendly walk together!`
` Let's swim in a pot of boiling chocolate, let's have a picnic in a cake‐rising oven!`
` Ahahaha, akya{0}kya{0}kya{0}kya{0}kyakya!!"`
`".........H‐hey, new {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`Behind the witch who was continuing her spree of tragedy, Beato showed herself.`
`...Her expression was very rare for her.`
` It was kind of restrained, somehow unreliable, miserable.`
`"Oh, it's the predecessor {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` Were you watching?"`
`"The power of magic is truly wonderful!`
` Until now, I had never thought it would be so fun to be reborn as a witch.`
` It's like playtime that never ends...!`
` Come on, let's play together, Predecessor‐sama...!!"`
`"But first, wait for a second, okay?!`
` The two of them were cooked to death in the oven, so I have to revive them again!"`
`"They're like bread rising because of yeast!`
` Like cookies expanding in an oven!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"L‐Listen to what I'm saying..."`
`"......Umm, well.`
` Isn't that enough for the sacrifices of the second twilight?`
` ...Of course, it isn't specified how you kill them, but,`
` umm,`
` ......maybe you shouldn't toy with them any more than that..."`
`"What are you saying, Predecessor‐sama?`
` I heard from Ronove a short while ago.`
` That your magic was much, much more wonderful, cruel, and self‐indulgent!"`
`"A Halloween party where candies poured out of six people's stomachs, how truly wonderful!`
` As for me, maybe I'll act out Alice's tea party...!`
` I'll invite everyone to a tea party to celebrate a happy unbirthday, and entertain them one by one with my magic!"`
`"I wonder if I can do it as wonderfully as you?`
` I wonder if I can be cruel in my own pop, cute style?!"`
`"Now that I think about it, all fairy tales are cruel, aren't they?`
` Now that I'm a witch inside one of those fairy tales, I finally understand.`
` Kyahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}kukyahya{0}fuhyaha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"...............I, I am, umm,`
` ...slightly of the opinion that, in the past,`
` ...I, too, might have gone a little too far.`
` ......Well, I think that as the Golden Witch, it's a good idea to have a little elegance..."`
`"..................???`
` I don't understand what you're saying, Predecessor‐sama."`
`"But there's one thing I do understand.`
` No matter how hard I try now, I'm no match for how cruel you are.`
` I've gotta try much, much harder.`
` I've gotta become more cruel, and become an excellent Golden Witch...!"`
`"L‐like I said, you've already done enough here...!`
` A‐anyway, this is my order, as your predecessor.`
` That's enough for the second twilight.`
` I'll show you how it's done.`
` Stand back and watch..."`
`"Yes, Predecessor‐sama.`
` I can't wait to see what brutal, cruel, and disgusting method of killing you'll use."`
`The new witch pinched the sides of her skirt and gave a graceful bow,`
` stepping back as an expectant gaze rose to her face.`
`......She was expecting an even more cruel magic that surpassed even herself.`
`"............Well, speaking of that...`
` You're only half a witch if you can only kill with methods like that.`
` ...I shall show you an elegant way to kill, worthy of the Golden Witch..."`
`When Beato waved her pipe, seven colors of smoke poured out, reviving Rosa and Maria.`
`......Compared to how the new {f:5:Beatrice} had done it a short while ago, it was slightly gentler.`
` ...It was probably gentler than how Beato had done it herself up until now.`
`Rosa's consciousness had already grown dim from the pain of so many repeated deaths.`
`...But even so, she pleaded that her daughter be spared...`
`"......Please......have mercy......`
` ...Even......if it's just Maria......have mercy......"`
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, Mama, Mamaaaaaa!!"`
`".........Sorry.`
` My disciple just, umm, ...acted without restraint for a bit.`
` ...Umm,`
` .........forgive me."`
`"B‐{f:5:Beatriceeeeeeeeeeeee}!!`
` Waaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaahh, waaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaahh!!"`
`When Maria realized it was the real {f:5:Beatrice}, she jumped onto her.`
`"...You promised, right, Beato?!`
` You promised that you would take me to the Golden Land, right?!`
` There I can be friends with Mama, and everyone will laugh together...!`
` You promised that you would take us there, right?!"`
`".........A‐`
`...about that.`
` ...I can no longer...`
`keep that promise.`
` .........Because someone appeared who could solve the riddle,`
` ......I am no longer the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......So, I'm sorry.`
` ...I can no longer keep my promise with you......"`
`"Why...?`
` Why...?`
` Beato, you promised..."`
`"......I'm sorry.`
` ...I'm truly sorry...`
` .........So at least, in apology for not being able to keep my promise..."`
`............I'll give you a truly quiet sleep,`
`{n}which will never be disrupted again...`
`Beato embraced Maria with a loving expression...`
`Then, .........softly, a red bruise appeared on Maria's neck.`
`{n}It was a very gentle bruise.`
`...It grew redder and redder, ...and when it distinctly formed itself into the shape of a hand...`
`......Maria's neck tilted suddenly.`
`{n}...Peacefully, as though she had fallen asleep.`
`"M‐Maria......`
` ...MariaaaAAaaaAAAAAaa!!"`
`"......Sorry.`
` ......I won't apologize that you were the sacrifices for the second twilight.`
` That is simply your fate."`
`"However, I must apologize for the vulgar way in which you were offered as sacrifices...`
` ......This is your final sleep.`
` ...Never again will it be disturbed..."`
`Beato softly, gently lifted her finger, as though touching the empty air in front of her nose.`
`...When she did, a light breeze lifted up, making Rosa's body dance lightly like a feather.`
`Then, Rosa's body floated lightly,`
` ......and there was the garden fence, with its spear‐shaped prongs.`
`The spear of the fence pierced Rosa's medulla oblongata.`
`......Benevolently, without toying with her, in a single blow.`
`{n}Rosa's life was snuffed out.`
`Compared to the earlier innocent yet cruel events, her end was surprisingly tame.`
`...It just looked like a doll shaped like Rosa was leaning against the fence.`
`...But, she had passed away.`
`".........W‐...well, that's pretty much how you do it."`
`Beato acted proud, but the new witch wore a blank expression, almost as though this was an anticlimax.`
` And she was forthright with that opinion.`
`"It's kinda plain...`
` ......Very different from the person Ronove told me about."`
`"...Well, um, ...you must use magic with dignity, you see...?`
` If it's too, umm, ...undignified, that isn't very elegant..."`
`".............................................`
` ......But you can do wonderful things endlessly with this magic.`
` ......How boring."`
`"Now now! No complaining...!`
` The path of a Golden Witch cannot be completed in a day.`
` You are still incomplete until you finish the tenth twilight...`
` For now, stay quiet and follow my instructions.`
` ...Alright......?!"`
`"......................................."`
`"Wh‐what happened to your answer?`
` Your answer...!"`
`"...........................`
` ...............Fiiine."`
`"...Better, much better.`
` ......Well, there is still much to do for the resurrection ritual.`
` You still have to kill five people...`
` You should do it without toying with them too much, with beauty and dignity,`
` ...and with at least a little decorum, alright...?"`
`"What Ronove told you about how I did it, ......that was a bad example.`
` You mustn't use that as a model.`
` Engrave that into your heart."`
`"............Yes, Predecessor‐sama."`
`"A good answer.`
` ......Ronove, the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, arise...!"`
`"......Yes, Milady.`
` Ronove, right here."`
`"Lucifer the Proud, right here."`
`"...Up until this point, umm, I've done things a little flashy, but,`
` ......umm,`
` ......well, the dignity of the Golden Witch is also important,`
` so, what I'm trying to say is—"`
`As Ronove chuckled at Beato's uncharacteristically flustered speech,`
` he summed it up for her.`
`"Certainly.`
` From now on, we will be careful to perform in a graceful manner, suitable for the name of the Golden Witch.`
` ......Even the Seven Sisters of Purgatory will reform their previous bad behavior,`
` and we shall espouse to perform our task in the quickest possible manner.`
` ......Would that be acceptable? Milady?"`
`"M‐mm.`
` That's it, more or less.`
` Everyone, take it to heart!`
` Alright...?!"`
`"Yes.`
` Certainly."`
`"That is all I wish to say.`
` ......You may leave now."`
`"Certainly.`
` If you would excuse me."`
`"Excuse us."`
`".........................................."`
`"Well, ...that's all I want to say.`
` So, take care as you continue, alright?`
` Go with dignity, and, ...umm, decorum, befitting the Golden Witch, alright?`
` ......You should do your best.`
` I will be watching over you."`
`Acting unsure until the very end, Beato communicated only that to her,`
` became a group of gold butterflies, and vanished into thin air.`
` It may be fitting to say that she disappeared in a hurry because she was having trouble maintaining the conversation.`
`After that, all that remained was Maria's outstretched body, pounded by the rain,`
` and Rosa's body, propped up by the fence and gazing up at the sky.`
`......And the figure of the witch.`
`".....................Show some decorum............you say."`
`Her expression looked just a little bored.`
`There was a popping sound.`
`{n}...That was probably her clicking her tongue.`
`".................................`
` ...........................What a boring person."`
`Leaving that last sentence behind, she, too, vanished into thin air......`
`"..............................zzzzz..."`
`"..................Whew.`
` ...Looks like she's finally calmed down..."`
`Hideyoshi wiped his own forehead.`
` ...For a time, Eva had seemed to be having a very painful nightmare, but it appeared that she had finally fallen asleep.`
`As promised, he still gripped Eva's hand.`
` ...He thought it would probably be alright to let go about now, but he faithfully continued to hold her hand.`
`Every once in a while, his hand would get tired, and he would switch between his right and his left,`
` but even so, as promised, he never let go of her hand...`
`At that time, there was a heavy knock.`
` Eva had finally managed to fall asleep, so Hideyoshi grimaced for just an instant.`
`"......Aneki, Hideyoshi‐san, sorry.`
` Is Rosa there...?"`
`It was Rudolf's voice.`
` ...What could it be?`
`Hideyoshi headed for the door, hiding his footsteps so that he wouldn't wake Eva.`
`......It was definitely Rudolf's voice, but just in case, he opened the door without removing the chain.`
`"What is it?`
` Somethin' happen to Rosa?"`
`"We can't find Rosa or Maria‐chan.`
` I thought they might be with you."`
`"...I heard her scoldin' Maria‐chan in the corridor.`
` They got quiet after that, so I thought they went back to the lobby......didn't they...?"`
`"............That idiot..."`
`Rudolf clicked his tongue.`
`Other people could be seen in the corridor.`
` It had been some time since Rosa went out into the corridor, and she had still not returned, so they had begun to worry.`
`Near the front door, Natsuhi pointed at the removed chain.`
`"......The chain isn't set.`
` They must have gone outside to see the rose after all."`
`"Going out and leaving the door unlocked, that is simply too careless.`
` What a troublesome person."`
`"...More importantly for now, I'm worried about Rosa‐san and Maria‐chan themselves."`
`"Right.`
` ......Hey, brats.`
` Where was this rose of Maria‐chan's?!"`
`"I'm pretty sure...it was in the flower bed right in the middle of the rose garden..."`
`"If those two are there, we should be able to tell quickly if we go."`
`"......Dad, I think we should bring them back as soon as we can..."`
`"Of course.`
` We'll bring them both back and spank them on the butt.`
` I'll dash out there and come back.`
` Lock the door as soon as I go out."`
`"...Dad, I'll go with you."`
`"Don't be an idiot.`
` You're a brat, and what brats do is they watch the house with Mommy."`
`"............What is it...?`
` Did something happen......?"`
`"Sorry, did I wake you up...?`
` ...Seems like Rosa‐san took Maria‐chan outside.`
` ...How reckless of her."`
`"Rosa and Maria‐chan went...`
`...outside...?`
` Into the rose garden......?!"`
`"That's right.`
` ...Oh, I guess you must've heard.`
` Maria‐chan was causin' a ruckus 'cause she wanted to see her rose."`
`"......Th‐......they mustn't,`
` ......they mustn't go to the rose garden...!`
` Tell Rosa to stop...!"`
`"Th‐there's no tellin' her to stop now, it looks like they left a while ago.`
` ......Seriously, how reckless of them."`
`".........That's not it...`
` ...Not the rose garden...`
` ...There's a witch there...`
`......and she's waiting for a sacrifice...!`
` Rosa, you mustn't go...`
`......ooooooooooohhh..."`
`...Eva curled herself up again, holding her head.`
`{n}......Her complexion looked very bad.`
`"What is it?`
` Did the fever make you dream somethin' bad?"`
`"............It was a dream,`
` ......yes...`
` ............In the rose garden, the witch, doing that to Rosa and Maria......`
` .........That's right.`
` ...It's a dream,`
` ......yes..."`
`"Calm down.`
` I'm also in this room.`
` The chain is set, too.`
` The shutter's closed on the window, and there's even a gun.`
` This room is just like a fort.`
` There's not a thiiing to be afraid of."`
`Hideyoshi beat his chest, trying to calm her, but Eva's insecure expression didn't change.`
`...Under the covers, Eva kept praying...`
`that the grotesque nightmare she had just had was only a dream...`
`"In the center of the rose garden, Rudolf confirmed the bodies of Rosa and Maria.`
` After that, he returned to the guesthouse, called for help, and carried both of them into the guesthouse."`
`"If we can trust Nanjo's examination, the cause of Rosa's death was a stab to the medulla oblongata with the pointed gate of the fence.`
` It is thought that Maria's death was due to strangling with bare hands.`
` However, due to the "Devil's Proof", we cannot discount a misdiagnosis."`
`"......I will say it in red.`
` {p:1:Rosa and Maria died}.`
` {p:1:The causes of death were as Nanjo diagnosed}.`
` ......She wasn't eaten by a spider, nor was she crushed by a mountain of cake.`
` Don't worry."`
`"............So you argue that even though you toyed with their death so much, it's all okay because the corpse is clean...`
` I definitely won't forgive you.`
` ...All of that brutal treatment you gave Auntie Rosa,`
` I'll never forget it, and I'll never forgive you for it..."`
`"...L‐like I said, that wasn't me......`
` ...I think I gave them a much more peaceful death than the way she treated them..."`
`"Shut the hell up.`
` I don't want to listen to you.`
` .........I've been told that there are no more than 18 people on this island, and now that eight people are already dead,`
` the suspects are narrowed down to ten.`
` One of them probably killed those two."`
`"...Or it could also be an accidental death.`
` Like Maria was having a tantrum,`
` and when Auntie Rosa tried to stop her crying, she misjudged how much power she was using and accidentally killed her.`
` Then, in her consternation, she slipped and fell, landed on the fence, and unluckily, died."`
`"......How's that?`
` That way there's no need for a witch or magic."`
`"......Well, that's not true.`
` Actually, Rosa and Maria—"`
`"Shut up.`
` Didn't I say that I didn't want to listen to you?`
` You're an eyesore, so get lost.`
` You monster."`
`Battler said that without rage, ...but with a horribly cold voice.`
`...Beato had also felt something out of place since the beginning.`
`{n}In a fight, both of them could go at each other without restraint.`
`However, he wouldn't even step into the ring.`
`{n}She could feel that coldness.`
`Beato wasn't pleased about that.`
`{n}...She thought about flaring up, but she held back.`
`Maybe even though she was innocent and childish,`
` she had enough sense to realize that she shouldn't fight.`
`"........................`
` ..................Is that so?`
` Then I will hide myself.`
` ...Ronove, continue for me."`
`"Certainly.`
` ...Will that be satisfactory, Battler‐sama?"`
`".........There are no problems with that proposal.`
` If Battler‐kun says that he doesn't want to see Beato's face, I believe that will be an acceptable alternative."`
`"Do what you like.`
` ...I couldn't care less what you do as long as I don't have to look at that monster's face."`
`"......Hey, wait a second.`
` ...You keep saying "monster monster", but isn't that a mean way to speak of me?"`
`"......Why do you instinctively hate me so much, Battler?`
` None of that was me, it was all the work of my disciple..."`
`".........It's not like I'm only mad about what happened just now.`
` It's from the very beginning."`
`"Come on, Battleer.`
` Don't misunderstand, alright...?`
` Aren't we just a pair of players confronting each other through a game?`
` ...We look for moves to make things painful for each other, but—"`
`"Don't get the wrong idea.`
` I don't hate you because you're my rival in this strange game about whether I accept you as a witch or not.`
` ......I just cannot in any way forgive how senselessly cruel you are."`
`"That's because a serial murder is part of the game...`
` It's probably impossible to avoid a little cruelty..."`
`"I'm not just talking about what just happened.`
` The last time, and the time before that too.`
` ......Tearing everyone's stomach and stuffing it with sweets, plowing their face.`
` What was the point of all that?"`
`"..................That's...`
`well—"`
`"All this stuff about locked‐room murders and tricks and alibis,`
` I'm willing to give you a pass on all that.`
` You want to claim that these are murders done by magic,`
` so I'll grudgingly accept that those complicated crimes have to occur."`
`"......But what exactly are all those grotesque murders supposed to mean?"`
`"............Well, umm,`
` ...............nothing much..."`
`"That's right.`
` They don't mean anything.`
` You're just fooling around by mangling the corpses for fun.`
` That has nothing to do with whether you're a witch, or whether it could or couldn't be done with magic."`
`"You're just exploring the depths of cruelty for fun.`
` I don't hate you because you're a witch, or anything like that.`
` There's just some things I cannot forgive as a human."`
`".........Wh‐`
`......what do you mean, as a human...?"`
`"For example,`
` ......the six people of the first twilight for this game.`
` ...Well, other than Grandfather being burned black,`
` the other five corpses were killed in a normal way, without any unnecessary shaming of the dead."`
`"...It wasn't clear whether the weapon was a spear or a gun, but anyways, as far as killing goes, that was permissibly better.`
` It was much better than the insanity and cruelty of the first twilight last time, or the time before that."`
`"And this time, there were six locked rooms tied together to make a locked‐room chain.`
` ......That was sort of interesting.`
` When we were going back and forth with each other on that, to be perfectly honest, I thought it was just a little fun."`
`"...You were frantic to make me accept your existence, and I was frantic trying to deny it.`
` ......We were both frantically doing all we could."`
`"This may sound weird, but I even felt a faint sense of sportsmanship between the two of us.`
` ...We exist in conflict,`
` but I faintly thought that we {i:might} not be {i:completely} unable to understand each other's existence."`
`".........But just now, that feeling was blown away without a trace."`
`"Th‐that's where you're misunderstanding...!`
` That wasn't me—"`
`"That's not it.`
` That's not what I'm talking about!`
` ......You watched Auntie Rosa being killed horribly over and over,`
` and you sneered at it like it was an interesting show."`
`.........When I saw that, I was deeply disappointed.`
`When I realized that your decision to kill them in a slightly better way this time had been nothing more than a little whim,`
` ...and that nothing had changed in your cruel character, I was deeply disappointed.`
`And that's not all, you were even genuinely enjoying a brutal death.`
`You weren't just acting as cruel as you could to bully me.`
`...You truly, genuinely enjoy cruelty.`
`Your character lets you enjoy it.`
`You saw Auntie Rosa being brutally killed over and over, and said, isn't this fun?`
`That wasn't sarcasm, you enjoyed it from the bottom of your heart,`
` wanted to share that feeling with me, and said, isn't this fun?`
`......In that instant, I despaired, and I realized the truth.`
`"The problem isn't whether you're a witch or not.`
` ......That cruelty of yours is unforgivable to me.`
` And I can't understand it!`
` I can't forgive it, either!`
` Still, I'll continue this game of whether to accept or deny witches.`
` I won't step down and accept my own defeat."`
`"However, your pointless cruelty is absolutely not needed for that game.`
` So I've decided that I won't accept you as my opponent.`
` Ronove is a hundred times better.`
` He doesn't have the same cruel hobby you do.`
` Even if he does, he doesn't have the awful taste to show it off in front of me."`
`"......That's right, you have awful taste.`
` You're heartless and cruel, so you can't understand.`
` That's unpleasant in an opponent.`
` So I don't want to see your face again."`
`After Battler had finished his rant, Beato was shocked into silence for a long time.`
`Maybe she couldn't understand what she was being told,`
` or maybe this was a sign that she was doing all she could in an effort to understand.`
`For a while, she kept switching between angry expressions, frustrated expressions, bold expressions,`
` ......as though she didn't even know herself what attitude she should take.`
`In the end, she made her face into a candid expression, as though she had come to her senses,`
` and shrugged her shoulders as though she was tired.`
`"........................`
` .........In that case, do as you like.`
` From now on, I will continue this game through Ronove.`
` ......You have no complaints as long as I don't show myself, right?"`
`"......For the time being.`
` But I definitely won't forgive your countless cruel actions up until now.`
` So I definitely won't accept you.`
` For that reason as well, I won't back down from this fight you've picked.`
` And I definitely won't lose.`
` ...That's all there is to it."`
`"...............Beato.`
` No matter how many more excuses you give, his impression of you will not waver.`
` ...I have something to talk about later.`
` Until then, stay back."`
`".....................M‐...mm...`
` ...Alright.`
` ...Then I'll hide myself until I'm called..."`
`Looking lonely, Beato turned her back to them, and hid herself.`
`...Battler watched, a slightly displeased expression on his face.`
`He thought his argument had been valid, but for some reason, his mood didn't clear up.`
`"......She's...`
`an idiot."`
`".........That's true.`
` An idiot, and honest."`
`"That idiot watched with me as Auntie Rosa was horribly killed,`
` and turned around with a huge smile on her face."`
`"......She really believed that she could laugh with me at that cruel show.`
` ...She really believed that I could sympathize with that emotion..."`
`"Looking at that innocent smile, I felt just horrible.`
` ......It would have been much better if she'd said it with her normal bullying face...`
` ...Damn it..."`
`"Milady has never had the experience of having a friend.`
` ......In addition, she has probably never had something spoken to her that strongly."`
`"Both Madam and I are her attendants.`
` No matter what we say, it will not reach her ears.`
` For Milady, this is also—"`
`"To hell with that.`
` I don't remember ever becoming her friend."`
`"......That is true.`
` My apologies."`
`".....................`
` ......There is one thing I would like to thank you for.`
` ...Thank you for not backing down from that child's game."`
`She spoke words of gratitude, but for some reason, Battler made a displeased face.`
`Then, as though finding revulsion in his own bad mood, he chuckled.`
`"Now that I've even got witches and demons thanking me, I'm screwed.`
` ......Let's resume the game.`
` Of course, I don't intend to go easy on you."`
`"I wouldn't have it any other way.`
` Unlike Milady, I do not get agitated."`
`"......I've already made my move.`
` If we suppose that Auntie Rosa is the culprit and died in an accident, I can deny the witch.`
` ......I don't want to suspect Auntie Rosa, but for now I'll deliberately assume that it was her, just to beat the hell out of Beato."`
`"I will deny it with red.`
` {p:1:Rosa's and Maria's deaths were homicides}."`
`"Alright.`
` ...Why don't we start from there.`
` ...............Damn, I'm just not getting fired up."`
`Since Rosa and Maria had been killed, it had become clear that the murderer was still hiding somewhere,`
` trying to add even more murders to this chain.`
`As he shed tears, Rudolf scolded Rosa's body over and over for being reckless,`
` but Rosa would never respond to that again.`
`They decided to place the two bodies in one of the guest rooms, and to seal it until the police arrived...`
`The second murder, ...no, the murder of the second twilight, had delivered a heavy blow to everyone.`
`Because it had blown away the optimism that some of them had held—`
`the thought that "actually, a crime didn't occur, and it was all a game or a farce by Kinzo and the servants".`
`Trying to distract themselves from the sadness of losing the people they loved,`
` George and Jessica had spent the whole time since morning talking about every possibility.`
`......And, they had distracted their hearts...`
`...by supposing that these murders might actually have all been an act,`
` and that Shannon and Kanon were only pretending to be dead.`
`When the murders occurred again, it destroyed that thought,`
` ......and they were once again confronted with the fact that their loved ones had most definitely been killed...`
`The tears that they'd thought had died away began to drip down once more, and Battler couldn't think of anything to say to them...`
`After that, to be extra cautious, all of the adults checked that all of the rooms were safe, and that everything was locked.`
`They made certain that the shutters on all of the windows were down and locked, and they checked that no one suspicious was hiding anywhere.`
`On top of that, they checked their weapons once again,`
` and made sure that each other's hearts were prepared, so that they wouldn't hesitate to fire off a preemptive shot if they saw the shadow of a mysterious person.`
`Furthermore, the gun Rosa had been holding had been left near the place she had been found.`
`Someone had gone out of their way to leave it there, so everyone suspected that it was some kind of trap,`
` but when Hideyoshi made ingenious use of a fire iron to fire off a test shot, it discharged without a problem.`
`When all five shots that had been loaded discharged without any problems as a result,`
` it was reloaded with bullets and handed over to the only adult male who wasn't armed, Hideyoshi.`
`However, the fact that it had been able to fire off five shots gave rise to a certain paranoia.`
`This short barrel rifle could load a maximum of five shots.`
`{n}In other words, Rosa hadn't fired even once.`
`And yet, the two had probably been killed by someone with their bare hands.`
`This meant there was a possibility that the crime had been committed by someone whose face they knew...`
`"......When the first murder occurred,`
` I privately thought of the possibility that it was all an act."`
`"...My apologies to Doctor Nanjo, but if he had actually been in on it,`
` and only convinced us that the servants were dead,`
` I thought this could have been some massive, elaborate act by Father."`
`"......After all, unless we assume they were acting, that locked‐room situation of theirs couldn't have been created in the first place."`
`"...We also...`
`...suspected that.`
` ...No,`
` ...I still want to believe that's the case."`
`"...............My apologies, ......but that is not so.`
` ...I am quite old.`
` There may be a chance that I made a misdiagnosis.`
` ......However, I would never mistake whether they were alive or dead..."`
`"I get it!`
` Don't frickin' say it out loud, Doctor Nanjo...!"`
`"......My apologies..."`
`They couldn't know about it,`
` but Beato had already proclaimed the deaths of the six,`
` ...no, this time the deaths of all victims so far, in red.`
`That faint dream that it was all a farce, and that the victims were actually alive,`
` ......was, sadly, impossible...`
`"......In that case, it's more natural to think there's someone hiding on this island who knows the mansion inside out,`
` carrying out a crime they've been planning for ages.`
` In other words, from the time that the typhoon came to this island and sealed it off from the outside world, there were more than 18 people on this island."`
`And, of course, they had no way of knowing this either:`
`That claim of Rudolf's had also been denied in red.`
`{n}There are no more than 18 humans on this island...`
`"Maybe it makes some sense if we think of it this way.`
` ......Essentially, there's the possibility that the person who's hiding is someone who wasn't originally supposed to be on the island right now,`
` yet is someone whose face was known by Rosa‐san, and with whom she would let her guard down."`
`"......S‐`
`so, for example,`
` could it be...a servant whose shift doesn't lie on these two days...?"`
`"Hmm......`
` ...It's hard to argue with that one.`
` After they finish their duties, it is not as though we verify that they leave the island by punching a ticket or something.`
` If we suppose that a servant on a shift from a few days ago only pretended to leave the island, and actually stayed here,`
` that would be hard to deny..."`
`"......Rosa‐san isn't stupid, if you ask me.`
` If a servant who's not supposed to be here popped up in front of you, that'd normally set alarm bells ringing..."`
`"...............I have a problem with assuming this was a crime by an acquaintance.`
` ...Perhaps whoever it was suddenly attacked Rosa from the darkness, and were about to steal her gun.`
` Then Rosa fell, hit her head against the fence, and stopped moving.`
` The guesthouse was nearby, so they wanted to avoid the sound of a gunshot, and they killed Maria‐chan with their bare hands..."`
`"......That's also a possibility.`
` ...Still, even if that is the case..."`
`"Would they intentionally leave Rosa's gun at the scene of the crime?`
` I don't know what the culprit is armed with, but our guns should be a point of worry for them.`
` ...Wasn't that a perfect chance for them to thin out our supply?`
` Why'd they deliberately leave it at the scene of the crime?"`
`"At first, I thought that the gun was a trap.`
` ......That's what chessboard thinking says it would be.`
` By purposefully leaving it, they wanted to make one of us touch it.`
` And they must have wanted to make us pull the trigger.`
` ...I was sure that it would have some dangerous device to make it explode and cause massive injuries."`
`"But, it's actually alright.`
` ......I'd say, the culprit was probably in a hurry.`
` I'll bet that right now, they're regretting they missed their chance to steal a gun...!"`
`".........I don't like it.`
` It pisses me off, 'cause it's like a message from the witch, saying she isn't even scared of guns."`
`"...However, in any event, this is a fearsome opponent.`
` It should have been obvious to any observer that Rosa‐san was holding a gun.`
` To think that they attacked her despite that.`
` ......We should not neglect the fact that they are unafraid of guns."`
`"Mm...`
` It is as Natsuhi says.`
` ......We should probably be even more cautious than we have been."`
`"This is just for peace of mind, but...`
`.........at the time we think Rosa‐san went outside,`
` where was everyone...?"`
`"Natsuhi and I were here, along with Rudolf and Kyrie‐san.`
` I can guarantee their alibis."`
`"Eva and I were together.`
` I can guarantee that."`
`"Me, George‐aniki, and Jessica were together too.`
` ......When Auntie Rosa yelled at us to go back upstairs,`
` we turned right around and went back to the cousins' room with our tails between our legs."`
`"......Back then,`
` ...if we hadn't let Maria go..."`
`"Saying that isn't going to change anything..."`
`"............Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"I, I was reading a book in one of the upstairs rooms.`
` ......I was by myself, so no one can verify my alibi,`
` but I believe everyone saw me return upstairs with the children."`
`"...You could say any number of things like this,`
` but what if you jumped out the window, attacked Rosa,`
` then climbed back up using the rain gutter or something...?"`
`"D‐d‐don't be absurd...`
` How could I perform a feat like jumping down from the second story with this old body...or climbing up, for that matter..."`
`"......Let us stop this...`
` Suspecting each other...`
` It's more important that we trust each other, and, for the children's sakes as well, defend this place until the very end."`
`"Yeah...`
` ...It's like Natsuhi‐san says.`
` .........For now, let's stop doubting each other."`
`"You're right.`
` ...We may be useless as far as searching for the culprit is concerned.`
` ......We can only stay alive until tomorrow, inform the police, and follow their instructions.`
` Because the police will definitely expose who the culprit is."`
`".........What is it, Eva?`
` ...Is your body still feelin' bad...?"`
`"M‐Mother, what's wrong?`
` Are you alright...?"`
`"...Sorry.`
` ...It looks like my fever is still strong.`
` I'll be fine, so leave me alone..."`
`When they looked, they saw Eva staring at the floor, her breathing harsh again.`
`{n}...She had been able to act firm for a time, due to the urgency of their situation,`
` but it seemed her body wasn't at its best after all...`
`"Yes.`
` I killed those two.`
` Now, the only ones who know about the gold are us.`
` I won't give up even a scrap to the other siblings."`
`"............What have you done......!`
` There's so much of that gold!`
` Giving Rosa and the others their share wouldn't have been a problem at all...!"`
`"It would.`
` ...That gold is to be passed on only to the head of the Ushiromiya family.`
` And that makes that gold, all of it, in its entirety, the very honor of the head."`
`"......Putting even the smallest dent in it...`
`is definitely not something I will permit as the new Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"...Do you plan to continue these murders according to the witch's epitaph...?`
` Do you actually plan to kill five more people...?"`
`"Yes.`
` If I don't finish that annoying ritual, it seems that my power as a witch won't become complete.`
` ......Hey, "me"..."`
`"...The power of the witch is really awesome.`
` It really can make all of our fantasies become reality.`
` The power to make dreams more than just dreams...!"`
`"Now that I've learned of this power, I can no longer stop being a witch.`
` If I can complete the ritual and make my power whole, I'm sure I'll be able to teach you that feeling too.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Stop acting like an idiot...!`
` Haven't you played witch enough?`
` We found the gold.`
` And we've even been promised the position of successor to the head.`
` We'll probably need to tightrope walk just a bit, but at this point, that's a dream that will definitely come true.`
` ......Beyond that, what more could you wish for...?!"`
`"I wanted to become a witch."`
`"I don't know anything about that dream...!"`
`"That's it.`
` Because I kept holding on to that dream, I've lived at this age forever.`
` ......You threw that dream away by becoming an adult."`
`"......You thought, no matter how long you waited, the rabbit holding a clock wouldn't visit you,`
` and you wouldn't be able to meet Humpty Dumpty.`
` And of course, you definitely wouldn't be invited to the land of cards.`
` You gave up like that, and so you became an adult."`
`"And that's why you don't want to become a witch or anything like that anymore.`
` ...You've even forgotten that it was the dream of your true self."`
`"......Look, just stop it!`
` I've already gotten my hands on two dreams!`
` The gold and the position of head.`
` That's more than enough!`
` So please, your dream has nothing to do with me!`
` Be obedient...!!"`
`".........No waaaay.`
` Magic's too much fun.`
` .........Besides, those two dreams of yours both came true because of my magic.`
` It's not fair if my dream doesn't come true too."`
`"I am grateful for your magic, and I accept you as a real witch.`
` ......So please, be obedient now and return to the inside of my heart!`
` And never appear again!!"`
`"No waaay.`
` ......We're both misunderstanding each other, aren't we?`
` That's right, I am not you anymore.`
` You are Ushiromiya Eva.`
` I am the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"So I have no responsibility to go back inside your heart.`
` ......I would say I feel like a butterfly who has broken out of her cocoon, namely you."`
`"............haah,`
` ......haah......`
` ...Urg,`
` ......the fever...`
`is making my mind cloudy......"`
`"My inexperience with my magic power is making me support it with your vitality.`
` Until I finish the ritual and become a full witch, you might have to bear the burden.`
` I'll take that in exchange for making two of your dreams come true."`
`"......It's alright, don't worry, okay?`
` For the remaining five sacrifices, I'll avoid your family."`
`"Let's see, Rudolf, Kyrie, Krauss, Natsuhi.`
` ...And what about that old geezer Nanjo?`
` Perfect, I'll kill those five people.`
` *giggle*giggle*, could you call this a murder announcement revealed only to yoouu?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`Eva finally crouched down.`
`{n}Hideyoshi rushed up to her, and lent her his shoulder...`
`"......Are you alright?`
` ...Let's take it easy and rest!"`
`"Are you alright...?`
` Doctor Nanjo, take a look at Eva...!"`
`When Nanjo and George tried to approach, Eva made a gesture to stop them.`
`"...Thank you.`
` I'm fine, Doctor Nanjo.`
` I'm taking medicine.`
` ......I apologize for saying this in such an extreme situation,`
` ...but let me rest a little longer..."`
`"Mom...I'll lend a hand too..."`
`"Thank you,`
` but I'll be fine as long as your father watches over me.`
` ......Go back to the cousins' room upstairs, and don't come out no matter what.`
` ...Understood...?`
` No matter what happens, you must not leave the guesthouse......"`
`"...Outside,`
` ......that...witch is......`
`uuuuhrg..."`
`"Don't talk anymore...!`
` Sorry, everyone, but I'll be watchin' over Eva in the room.`
` Call if somethin' happens."`
`Hideyoshi and Eva retreated from the lobby.`
`...Of course, Eva wasn't the only one who wasn't feeling well.`
` They hadn't gotten a wink of sleep since the previous night, and had been pressed by tension since the morning.`
`...They were mustering their energy to protect their families,`
` but if they relaxed even a little, surely every of one them would be down and out...`
`"......Everything has gone as planned so far, but from here on out, it will become difficult, you see?"`
`"Difficult, you say...?"`
`"Mm.`
` In most cases, as the ritual progresses and the victims increase, they begin to tighten their guard,`
` and often, they hole up in one place and stop moving.`
` That is extremely inconvenient for us."`
`"...Are you saying that we witches are inferior to a bunch of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s in a group...?"`
`"Witches are never inferior to {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s...`
` However, perhaps you could say that times change, and that {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s have gotten their hands on a poison..."`
`"......This wasn't a problem long ago, during the period when witches were believed in,`
` but just like that annoyance Battler, people in the current era generally deny magic."`
`"In other words, their existence itself is anti‐magical.`
` As a result, at some point, they grew to possess a toxin inside their bodies that denies magic."`
`"In other words, you're saying that the more {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s there are,`
` the stronger that anti‐magic toxin gets, and the greater the disadvantage is for us witches?"`
`"......The total value of all their hearts' power to deny magic, in other words their Magic Resistance, becomes the denominator to our Magic.`
` Understand?`
` Is that a bit too difficult for you...?"`
`"You're joking.`
` I understand it truly easily.`
` ...In other words, you're saying that the more people there are that don't believe in magic,`
` and the stronger their will is, the greater the dramatic division in the effect of the magic is.`
` ......I see, if that's the kind of formula it is, I'll have to rethink my method of attack."`
`Fundamentally, magic possesses a vast power.`
`It can even make a rain of fire fall from the heavens, divide a sea, and reviving a lost life isn't impossible either.`
`However, that power is extremely weak against the toxin that rejects it.`
`And that toxin has been piling up in {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s since the time they forgot their respect for all things sacred,`
` ...until finally, this earth was covered with enough toxin that the miracles of magic could not be displayed.`
`Thus, witches from across the world were chased from their dwellings.`
`...They were forced to choose whether to throw away their magic and live as {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, or live in hiding in remote areas where the toxin of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s didn't reach.`
`In that sense, Rokkenjima, with its population of only ten to twenty humans, was extremely favorable for witches.`
`And even more favorable was the existence of the ghost story about the witch who lived in the Rokkenjima forest.`
`...Essentially, the fear that a witch might exist permeates the island to a certain extent,`
` weakening the anti‐magic toxin from the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.`
`A small population, and a margin of possibility to accept a magical being.`
`{n}In other words, minds that were only weakly anti‐magical.`
`...Only in the valley where those two converged...could a witch live in modern times...`
`"I see...`
` ......So by this formula, we can say that there are several rules a witch must follow to use her power efficiently."`
`"The first one is creating a scene.`
` Create a murder scene that you couldn't imagine was done by {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, decorate it with occult ornaments,`
` make it look very much like a witch exists, and by permeating the people with fear, make them believe that witches exist,`
` and as a result, the anti‐magic power and the denominator for the power of the magic will be decreased."`
`"......I see, so this is why the creepy magic circles of the first twilight were created?"`
`"Th‐that's right, exactly...!`
` The gaudy scenes for the first twilight each game are all for that reason.`
` It's definitely not as though I like cruel things or am doing it for fun..."`
`"...In that case, Predecessor‐sama,`
` this time was a failure.`
` You killed them in a very plain way.`
` It doesn't look like anything more than a simple mystery."`
`".........You should have damaged the bodies more grotesquely, like you did last time and the time before that, as I heard from Ronove,`
` making it look like a fantasy and instilling fear in those people."`
`".........W‐...well, about that.`
` ...I thought it wouldn't be artful to do that every time, you understand...?`
` Don't think too deeply on it, it's just a whim...!"`
`Actually, it really had been her whim.`
`{n}After being told all that by Battler, she couldn't say it out loud anymore,`
` but she had decided her method of killing based only on a whim.`
`No, would it be better to say that she had halfheartedly let Ronove decide?`
`{n}Because she had left the locked room of this game's first twilight to him.`
`But if Beato had gotten a cruel idea, then she surely would have explored the limits of atrocity even worse than the last game...`
`"...........................`
` For the methods of Rosa and Maria's deaths too, you told me to show restraint,`
` but that wasn't a course of action beneficial to us witches either, was it?"`
`"In actuality, at the present moment, none of them believe one bit that a witch actually exists.`
` They're sure that it isn't a fantasy, but completely in the mystery genre.`
` This turn of events is a failure for us witches.`
` ......And it's all because, for some reason, you keep doing things in a kinda lukewarm way, Predecessor‐sama."`
`"Aah... L‐like they say, you should seek out work while you're young...!`
` This is a test from me to you as your predecessor.`
` Challenge it with respect.`
` Wahahaha...!"`
`Beato tried to laugh heartily,`
` but it was obviously a fake laugh trying to cover something up,`
` and the new witch shrugged, sighing.`
`"........................`
` ...At this stage, it's probably too late to reduce the anti‐magic power by creating a scene.`
` ...In that case, there's another move.`
` Having the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s split up should work."`
`"Mmhm, that is probably the most effective way.`
` The smaller the number of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, the more the denominator shrinks.`
` As a result, the magic power becomes immediately effective.`
` ...In other words, the crucial point from here on will be how to destroy this barricade situation and have them split up into small groups."`
`"However, they are already very cautious.`
` The barricade won't be destroyed easily, you know...?`
` Both the barricade in Kinzo's study two games ago and the barricade in the parlor last time were very stubborn.`
` Furthermore, most of the cunning adults have been left this time."`
`"The situation is more difficult than all the ones before it, you see?`
` ......If you wish, I could give you some special advice..."`
`If the first murder case occurs in a closed circle, the survivors hole up without fail,`
` gathering together to observe each other and ensure their safety.`
`......Worrying about how to break that situation apart is probably the domain of murderers and mystery authors,`
` so how ludicrous it is that witches, who are meant to exist at the other end of the spectrum, share in that exact same worry.`
`For a while, the new witch poked her cheek with her index finger, making gestures as though deep in thought, and eventually spoke.`
`"...........................`
` ......No, I'm fine.`
` After all, it is a test.`
` ......I won't borrow your moves."`
`"Mh, ...really...?`
` ...The thing is, though, it will be pretty hard to defeat this barricade, you know...?"`
`"I've already made my move.`
` I'm pretty sure it will work.`
` If they're smart, then it definitely will."`
`"I‐is that so......`
` You really are excellent...`
` I am pleased that my disciple isn't hard to deal with."`
`"My motto is to study things myself before asking other people.`
` ......Then, if you would excuse me.`
` I have to wait for my prey to get nonchalantly lured out."`
`"Mm.`
` ...Well then, handle it with care."`
`As the new witch lowered her head, her face blank, she turned into gold butterflies and hid herself.`
`......Beato looked slightly unamused.`
`{n}It seemed she was lonely since she hadn't been relied on at all.`
`"...............Not one of them bothers themselves with me.`
` .........Hmph.`
` You witch apprentice, acting so smart.`
` ...I'll bet any moment now she's going to make some painful mistake and start crying."`
`"Then, without a doubt, she'll finally realize my greatness and follow my teachings!`
` *cackle*, until then, I shall watch from above."`
`She laughed loudly on the outside, but a laugh no one can hear is completely pointless.`
`Beato started to feel empty, and quickly stopped laughing.`
`...Ronove chose that time to show himself.`
`"Excuse me, Milady.`
` ......The game of the second twilight with Battler‐sama has ended."`
`"......Mh, ...I see.`
` Good work.`
` What was the result?"`
`"My sincere apologies.`
` I was forced to resign.`
` ......Battler‐sama's claim of "Rosa strangled Maria to death, then died in an accident",`
` I struck down in red with "both deaths were homicides",`
` ...but I could not repel his chain of moves placing Eva as the principal offender."`
`"But Eva was sleeping in her room the whole time as Hideyoshi cared for her."`
`"...He put forth the possibility that Hideyoshi was an accomplice, and that the two worked together to create an alibi."`
`"He even suspects Hideyoshi...?!`
` Couldn't you have struck back by saying in red that they were in the guest room at the time of the murder?"`
`"......I also thought of that, but, in any event, several important pieces might have been taken several moves later.`
` ...And, because there is a possibility that this move was part of the preparations made by the new {f:5:Beatrice},`
` I acted out of respect to her.`
` ...My apologies."`
`"Preparations, you say.`
` .........Her mind does seem to be sharp.`
` ...Hmm, we can let her do as she likes.`
` It will be quite a show to see how far she can go."`
`"Pukkukukuku.`
` I thought you would say that.`
` ......I see that your disciple's unpleasantness has you in a bad mood."`
`"That's none of your business.`
` I wonder how that one plans on destroying this barricade from here on out.`
` I shall keep a close eye on her."`
`"...............Oh, and...`
`...how was B‐...Battler's mood?"`
`"It appeared as though he had calmed himself down.`
` He did say that, after all, he couldn't get fired up without you as his opponent."`
`"R‐really, that's no surprise, no surprise at all!`
` If I don't return for the fourth twilight and after, Battler will probably be lonely himself...!"`
`"Pu ku ku ku...`
` And with that, if you would excuse me.`
` ...I must bake some delicious cookies.`
` So as to at least enliven the discussion between Milady and Battler‐sama."`
`"Mmhm!`
` That guy really was munching your cookies, wasn't he?`
` It must be because he's a boy that he can eat so much.`
` Make a lot of them...!"`
`"Certainly.`
` I shall make enough cookies to bury the table."`
`"Yes, you do just that!"`
`"......What's going on?`
` What did you want to talk about...?"`
`Kyrie called Rudolf out into the corridor.`
` It was obvious that she wanted to talk about something that she didn't want the others to hear.`
`"Umm, I..."`
`"Yeah?"`
`".........want to go outside."`
`"......Certainly, the body cannot last with nothing more than a small breakfast, but..."`
`"Of course, we understand.`
` But the thing is, as time passes, it'll get darker and darker.`
` Now is probably the lightest.`
` Now is the most convenient time."`
`"Only about an hour has passed since Rosa‐san was attacked.`
` This is simply too reckless...!"`
`It was only natural that Natsuhi was yelling about recklessness.`
`{n}...Because Rudolf had said that he was going to the mansion to get food.`
`Certainly, they were being tormented by hunger as well as their fatigue.`
`In the beginning, they were just fine, because they could fight their moderate hunger with their drowsiness;`
` but now it just made their minds hazy, and even though it was still only midday, their bodies felt like they were reaching their limits.`
`The thought of going to the kitchen in the mansion and bringing back some food certainly was attractive.`
`"I am opposed to this.`
` It may be a little tough, but we definitely shouldn't leave this place."`
`"......It is alright for us.`
` But it would pain my heart to keep the children hungry...`
` I must bear my responsibility as a parent."`
`"D‐dear...!`
` Now that Father has passed away, you are the Ushiromiya family head.`
` It is not permissible for you to take on such a danger...!"`
`".........Yes.`
` It's like Natsuhi‐san says.`
` Krauss‐san, you should remain here as the leader."`
`"......Then, who will go to the mansion?"`
`"I think Kyrie and I, and Hideyoshi nii‐san as well, should go.`
` Hideyoshi nii‐san and I are holding guns.`
` They shouldn't be able to lay a hand on us that easily."`
`"Rosa‐san was also holding a gun, but she was attacked.`
` ...Isn't it dangerous?"`
`"...When I went out to check on Rosa and Maria‐chan, I was alone, although I had a gun with me.`
` But I wasn't attacked.`
` ......Maybe they'll be cautious if their opponent is a man."`
`"Two men.`
` And even two guns.`
` Those two will act as guards, and I'll push the cart with the things.`
` I believe the situation clearly differs from Rosa‐san's."`
`"If you're countin' me as a man, I'd be pleased to help.`
` I don't look it, but I trained this body pullin' stalls.`
` Leave the heavy liftin' to me!"`
`"You men just need to devote yourselves to guarding.`
` There's a folding cart in the servant room, so using that, I should be able to handle carrying the food alone."`
`"......Of course, we will be careful.`
` And if we can succeed in this venture just once,`
` we'll never again need to take the risk of leaving this place."`
`"............Is there any way I can get you to reconsider?`
` It may be painful for everyone to deal with an empty stomach, ...but even so, we do not know what could happen outside now..."`
`"We'll take care.`
` ......And Eva's feelin' pretty darn bad right now.`
` I can't let her stay hungry.`
` If her stomach's empty, she can't even take her medicine.`
` I've gotta go out for Eva's sake as well."`
`"How is Eva?"`
`"She's finally gotten to sleep.`
` ...She's burnin' up, too.`
` We should leave her be for a while..."`
`"......I guess you can't just stand still when it comes to your wife's health...`
` .........Understood.`
` I'll give you permission to go outside."`
`"Then, we'll take a little trip there and back.`
` A speed contest.`
` Canned food is OK, right?`
` You at least have a can opener here, right?"`
`"Y‐yes.`
` We have a can opener and a bottle opener..."`
`"There's running water in the guesthouse, so we won't need anything to drink.`
` There's ten people to cover for, so you'll have to take what you get."`
`"Alright!`
` Let's dash out there and bring it all back pronto.`
` There's no time to open umbrellas...!"`
`"So, Aniki.`
` Watch the place for me."`
`"......Be careful.`
` ...Under normal circumstances, I would want to go too.`
` ...Being a man, I despise this title of eldest brother that prevents me from lending a hand in an emergency like this."`
`"This is about the only time we get to show off.`
` Sit back and take it easy every once in a while, Aniki.`
` Alright, Natsuhi‐san.`
` Wait here and get some towels ready or something.`
` We aren't using umbrellas, so we'll be coming back like drowned rats."`
`"U‐understood.`
` ...Take care."`
`Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi,`
` each leaving their own brave words behind, left the lobby...`
`Compared to the time Rosa and Maria had gone outside, the winds had picked up once again.`
`Rudolf's group of three people jogged through the rose garden without umbrellas, holding their guns and a folded cart.`
`If everything had been still and quiet, without the wind and the rain, they would probably have kept their ears open and moved with caution.`
`But in this rain, even if some suspicious person was hiding nearby, it would be difficult to notice them.`
`Because of that, it had been Rudolf's plan to instead dash through the dangerous area.`
`......If there was a chance that their opponent was equipped with a gun,`
` then walking slowly with their guard up would only make them a target.`
`It was probably correct to decide on swift action.`
`".........The rose garden.`
` It feels like we're just askin' to be attacked...!"`
`"Please, let nobody come out of there..."`
`Even as Rudolf and Hideyoshi continued to run, they looked around restlessly, vigilant of their surroundings.`
`Rosa and Maria's deaths had not been caused by a projectile.`
`{n}......However, it was easy to suspect that the servants had been killed in such a manner.`
`Will they come flying out of the dark?`
`{n}Or will they take careful aim and snipe from the shadows?`
`......Either way, they couldn't relax their tension for even an instant.`
`But even so, when they reached the overhang in front of the entrance to the mansion and escaped the reach of the raindrops,`
` they felt themselves breathing a sigh of relief.`
`"No problems for the first part.`
` ......It's not like how it was for Rosa‐san.`
` Maybe they can't get their hands on us easily."`
`"I'd like to believe that.`
` Kyrie, unlock the door while we keep a lookout."`
`"Sure.`
` Returning home to the mansion with a pair of bodyguards makes me feel just like an executive."`
`"Wahahahaha.`
` If we had a welcoming party of servants on a red carpet, it'd be perfect."`
`"A welcoming party, huh.`
` ...Careful what you wish for.`
` Stay alert."`
`As the two cautiously surveyed their surroundings,`
` Kyrie unlocked the front door with the master key she had been given.`
`"It's open."`
`"Hideyoshi nii‐san.`
` Could you take the front?`
` I'll keep an eye on the rear."`
`"Roger.`
` Kyrie‐san, try not to move from my shadow.`
` ......Alright, let's break in!"`
`"Rear guard, understood. Covering...!"`
`"......Men.`
` You're enjoying this situation a little bit, aren't you?"`
`"Give it up, that's how men are.`
` ......But man, there's still that rank stench."`
`...The air in the mansion felt stagnant with a heavy silence.`
`And worse, it was still thick with the stench from Kinzo's burnt corpse in the boiler room,`
` and they were struck with a strong desire to leave the mansion—although they were never planning to stay.`
`"No problems in the front.`
` Just a short dash to the kitchen."`
`"Let's finish this quickly and head home.`
` This suit'll get fumigated with Dad's stench."`
`The three of them dashed towards the kitchen...`
`And after they disappeared from the entrance hall, ......the new witch showed herself there.`
`"They were lured out just as planned.`
` ......They got caught right in my trap."`
`The witch grinned.`
`......Thinking about it now, no matter how unbearable their hunger had grown,`
` barely a few hours had passed since Rosa and Maria had been attacked and had lost their lives.`
`In that case, why had they needed to recklessly leave the guesthouse...?`
`Until that question could be dealt with, the only answer was that they had been called out by the witch's magic...`
`"What reckless people.`
` ......They will never leave this mansion alive.`
` Lock yourself, locks! Close yourself, mansion!"`
`The instant she proclaimed that...`
`...the mansion was sealed off in a separate world.`
`......Unless she were to dispel the barrier, no longer could anyone exit this mansion, or enter it.`
`"......Spectacular.`
` To think that even though barely half a day has passed since you succeeded the Endless Witch, you can use magic this well.`
` ......That talent surprises me.`
` It is almost as though you were born a witch."`
`"Well, I {i:have} been a witch since the time I was born.`
` ......Who taught you how to blink?`
` That's what using magic is like for me."`
`".....................`
` ...A fearsome person."`
`The witch's face twisted with brutality.`
`{n}......She was beside herself with excitement at being able to toy with lives again.`
`"Well then.`
` ......Gehehehe{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihyahya!`
` First is Rudolf and Kyrie, but what cruel way should I kill them...?!"`
`"......If you would excuse me,`
` but the Predecessor has left instructions that you are to restrain yourself from committing murders of unnecessary cruelty.`
` And, there is a protocol to follow for the sacrifices from the fourth twilight onwards.`
` For that, you must borrow the power of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory."`
`"......Oh, really?`
` Now that you mention it, that's right.`
` I'm only allowed to play as I like until the second twilight I just finished.`
` ..................Boring.`
` Just when I thought I could play to my heart's content like I did with Rosa.`
` ......But, that refers to the way they're killed in the end, right?"`
`"By which you mean..."`
`"So I can just kill them however I want over and over again, revive them,`
` and follow the epitaph the last time I kill them, right?"`
`"......So, in the end, no matter how I play, it isn't a problem.`
` ......Who'd act well‐behaved with an interesting power like this...?!`
` Kuhhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!"`
`Her wild logic was, for an Endless Witch, an extremely valid argument.`
`{n}The sacrifices for the fourth twilight and onward had prescribed protocols for the method of killing, represented by things like "gouge the head".`
`However, that referred to the way they died in the end.`
`In other words, ......in the process leading up to that, she was free to tease and kill them however she wanted.`
`She just had to keep on reviving them, and follow the rules only when she killed them the final time.`
`Even while Ronove glimpsed some talent as a witch in her innocent cruelty,`
` he was beginning to notice a naturally brutal side of her.`
`"......They do say that apprentices are the most brutal of witches, and now I see that may be true."`
`".........Do as you wish, ...is what I would like to say,`
` but I must insist that it would be wiser to exercise some restraint in this instance.`
` They are holding guns.`
` Weapons with a high anti‐magic power, such as guns, are the natural enemies of witches and demons."`
`The witch stared blankly at this demon butler, who was unexpectedly afraid of guns.`
`".........No one told me this.`
` Shouldn't a witch be able to take a bullet like it's nothing?"`
`"No.`
` It would be a fatal wound, exactly the same as it would for a normal {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` ...To prevent that weak point from being noticed,`
` most witches rigorously strengthen their guard with a defense of protective barriers and furniture."`
`"Do I have any of those protective barrier things?"`
`"......Constructing a barrier to make even gun bullets ineffective requires much in preparation and rituals.`
` I am afraid to say that you currently have none of those, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` Furthermore, you are currently ill‐prepared to summon furniture strong enough to block a bullet."`
`"So even though I've become a Great Witch with this much magical power, I really do have to be afraid of lead bullets.`
` .........Annoying, but I'll just have to accept it.`
` So, in that case, should I call some furniture to act as my arms and legs?"`
`"Yes.`
` Leaving everything to your servants while not exposing yourself to danger is also part of a witch's elegant temperance.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, leave this to the furniture and hide in a safe place."`
`"...............Fine."`
`"...Seven Sisters of Purgatory.`
` I don't care who, any two of you...!"`
`Leviathan and Belphegor responded to that call.`
`"Leviathan the Envious, right here."`
`"Belphegor the Slothful, right here."`
`"Show me your power.`
` Your targets are Rudolf and Kyrie.`
` Not Hideyoshi.`
` ......Now, show me just how cruel you can be, furniture."`
`"......My apologies,`
` but we have received an order from the Predecessor to restrain ourselves from unnecessarily cruel actions."`
`"Buuut, I think the Predecessor's order does give us some leeway to tease them.`
` Will that be acceptable?"`
`"Hmph.`
` Fine, I'll compromise."`
`"......You mustn't kill them easily.`
` Thoroughly corner them and let them taste the fear of death before killing them.`
` ......Will that be alright, Ronove?"`
`"Yes. If you simply remain conscious of the extent, I do not believe there will be a problem."`
`"...............Then, go!"`
`""Yes, leave it to us...!""`
`"Your opponents are armed with guns.`
` ...For those as skilled as yourselves, dodging them should be easy,`
` ...but if you are hit, it will be fatal.`
` Go with an appropriate level of caution."`
`"Do not worry.`
` We won't expose such a level of incompetence."`
`The two Sisters of Purgatory vanished.`
`{n}After bowing, Ronove also disappeared.`
`".........There's even rules on how to kill them.`
` .........Why do I have to be constrained by my predecessor?`
` ............It's so rigid and boring."`
`As the witch looked up at the portrait of the Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice} hanging in the hall, she cursed...`
`The three had already arrived at the kitchen, and were gathering food supplies.`
`Thinking of the possibility that poison had been mixed in, they gave up on the alluring fruits and vegetables,`
` and gathered a whole cardboard box full of only the safe canned foods.`
`It was very heavy, but by piling it on the cart, they could carry it well enough.`
`With all of that, there would be plenty for ten people to hold out until tomorrow's breakfast.`
` That would be enough while they waited for the boat.`
`The two men were supposed to be devoted to guard duty, but the weight of the load was tough on Kyrie even with the cart.`
`Hideyoshi, who professed himself strong, switched to being the cart‐pusher, and Rudolf and his wife took up the task of guard duty.`
`"With all this, even George and the kids will be full.`
` We're not safe until we're home, let's go...!"`
`When Hideyoshi vigorously proclaimed their departure, Kyrie frowned, looking as though she was gazing into the distance.`
`......There was a wall in that direction.`
` ...No, if her gaze could go through that, the hall was beyond it...`
`".........What is it, Kyrie?"`
`"...I sense something.`
` .........I have a bad feeling about this."`
`Kyrie stopped, narrowing her eyes even further.`
`".........Women's intuition?"`
`In times like this, Kyrie's intuition surpassed reason.`
`{n}...Rudolf trusted that intuition.`
`"Yes.`
` Someone's probably waiting to ambush us.`
` ......I didn't sense them until a short while ago.`
` ...But just now, I felt it.`
` ......Just now, someone...`
`{i:set up an ambush for us}."`
`"......Then, there's no reason we need to return the way we came.`
` There's a back door over there, right?`
` Let's leave that way."`
`Rudolf made to unlock the back door.`
`When things were carried into the kitchen, they never passed through the part of the mansion that the family came and went from.`
`So outside the back door, there was probably a slope for transporting things.`
` Surely, they would be able to leave through there with the cart.`
`"......What is this?`
` ...It's stuck.`
` ...Damn, what's going on?"`
`"Can't you open it?"`
`"Nope.`
` Is it broken?`
` It isn't giving an inch..."`
`Rudolf tried various things, using force, then coaxing it,`
` but the lock was as hard as stone, and didn't even budge.`
`"...Don't stress over it, let's leave through the front entrance.`
` Right now, it'll be even worse if we stand around wastin' time."`
`".............................."`
`"......Are you saying this is a trap?"`
`"...I don't know.`
` Be careful."`
`With strained expressions, the three of them returned to the hall again, and headed for the entrance...`
`"Wh‐......who's there?!!"`
`The instant they exited into the hall, Rudolf noticed a suspicious shadow right in front of them and yelled...`
`In that instant, a storm of gold leaf started blowing, and gold butterflies dyed the area a golden color.`
`"............I can't believe it.`
` A lowly {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} predicted our ambush?"`
`"I‐it isn't my fault.`
` I was hiding my presence...!"`
`"Don't hesitate!! FIRE!!!"`
`The two guns spouted fire.`
`The lead bullets blasted right through the pair's magic defense as easily as though it were a wet paper wall,`
` ......but the two who should have been there had disappeared.`
`Certainly, guns were very frightening objects for them.`
`...But there was no need to fear as long as they weren't hit.`
`{n}They at least had enough speed to dodge those.`
`"Wait a sec!`
` You won't even let us say our names?!`
` This is why I hate {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s!"`
`Leviathan protested, popping her head out from behind a pillar in the shadow of the staircase, a full ten meters from where she had supposedly been.`
`"By order of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, we shall now slay you!`
` We are ordered to take some time teasing you.`
` You are free to resist, but know that it is useless...!"`
`That voice came from overhead.`
`{n}Belphegor could be seen on top of the hall chandelier.`
`{n}Elegantly looking down upon them, she proclaimed their execution with a cruel smile.`
`"......Wh‐`
`......who the heck are these girls...?!"`
`"Forget the cart!!`
` We have two opponents, so if we split up, they can't chase all of us!"`
`All three of them were well acquainted with the inside of the mansion.`
`They had already made plans to run off in separate directions in the case of a crisis, returning to the guesthouse by breaking windows or leaving through a back door.`
`Fighting was forbidden.`
` ......As long as they could get away.`
`"Hah‐hah‐ha, of the thirty‐six stratagems, fleeing is best...!!"`
`The three of them escaped into the depths of the mansion at full tilt.`
`{n}The two furniture calmly watched them go.`
`"......I'll kill the woman.`
` You take the man!"`
`"Understood."`
`The two pieces of furniture in the shadow of the pillar and on the chandelier burst apart their humanlike forms,`
` and, leaving behind only the sound of hopping beetles colliding with the walls, they pursued their respective targets.`
`Their speed was overwhelming, and they easily blocked the others' path of retreat.`
`"............I'll inspect their skill as furniture.`
` It'd be nice if they entertained me."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, I might suggest it wise not to show yourself carelessly..."`
`"A king doesn't carelessly wander about the center.`
` That's part of a king's—`
`a witch's dignity!"`
`In front of Rudolf, who had boldly tried to escape to the second floor, Belphegor was already standing in the way.`
`"It's useless to try and resist or escape.`
` ......You don't need to think about anything.`
` Just close your eyes.`
` I'll bring everything to a gentle finish."`
`"You'd make a good wife.`
` Your husband would be pleased to hear that kind of thing when he comes home tired."`
`"To think that you're still relaxed enough to speak such vulgarity at a time like this...!"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, thank you for such good prey!`
` Die!!!"`
`Rudolf fired first.`
`But even before that bullet could hit her, Belphegor had already moved behind Rudolf's back.`
`There she stood, her arm raised above her, a purple trail extending from it...`
`However, even before that arm could decapitate Rudolf, unbelievably, Rudolf had swung his gun behind him.`
`The barrel pointed behind his back, from the same motion with which he had reloaded the sawed‐off gun one‐handedly.`
`It was pointing right at Belphegor's chest...`
`Takk, clunk‐rrrr...!`
` It was the sound of the ejected empty cartridge finally hitting the wall after the reload.`
`In other words, it meant that the next shot was already fully loaded.`
`Without turning around, his gun pointing right at Belphegor's chest, Rudolf grinned.`
`".........Not bad.........`
` ...For a middle‐aged man...!!"`
`"Don't look down on the generation that loves westerns, got it?`
` Brats don't know jack squat about the refinement of a lever‐action."`
`Just like Rudolf, Kyrie was also confronting a demon stake, in the first floor corridor.`
`"What an idiot you are.`
` You should have just escaped with your husband.`
` You do know that that was your final farewell just now, right...?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"Don't worry.`
` This kind of thing is my husband's specialty.`
` I'm sure he'll come for me on a white horse soon."`
`"Because he's never failed to come and save me when I'm in trouble.`
` ......Not even when Asumu‐san was around, you see?`
` Heheh."`
`"Heheheheheheheh!`
` What a happy couple.`
` I envy you.`
` .........I am Leviathan the Envious...!`
` Envy is itself my power.`
` My anger, my origin!"`
`"I agree.`
` Envy is the source of a woman's power.`
` ...And if you call something like that power, I won't lose to a girl like you."`
`"Hahhahahahahahahahaha!`
` Imagine saying that to the one who governs envy!`
` You actually think I'd let you two be reunited...?!!"`
`"Ahhahahahaha, I'll give you a tragic farewell!!"`
`The arm Leviathan swung trailed purple.`
`{n}It was a magic blade that cut by the power of malice.`
`Kyrie guarded herself against that with her gun.`
`......Even though the magic blade should have been able to cut through metal like butter, the {i:gun}, with its extremely high magic resistance,`
` was able to block the blade as easily as if it were a rolled up newspaper.`
`Rapidly, two times, three times.`
` It blocked all of them.`
`And, without missing the opening created when that purple trail took a long swing upward,`
` Kyrie kicked Leviathan in the stomach with her heel.`
`Almost like she was a lightly dancing feather, Leviathan was knocked away.`
`...Before the demon stake's feet touched ground again...`
`Kyrie had already perfectly captured Leviathan, who was in midair, down the barrel of her gun.`
`From midair, the two women who had spoken to each other of envy as power met each other's gaze.`
`"......C‐can you pull it?`
` That trigger...!!"`
`"You know, I can be pretty brutal when my husband isn't around."`
`"Whoawhoaoaoaoao!!"`
`Rudolf tumbled down the staircase.`
` He had been gradually chased down by Belphegor, and had been pushed back into the original hall.`
`".........The Predecessor's furniture is pretty good.`
` She's lacking in flair, though!"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...!`
` It isn't over yet, it's dangerous to show yourself...!"`
`"........................Could you...`
`...possibly be...Aneki?"`
`"That used to be my name.`
` But not now, Rudolf."`
`"You don't have to tell me.`
` You're going to say you're the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, right?"`
`"Ehheheheheh, ahhahahahaha!`
` How did you know?"`
`"......Since the time Rosa was killed, I had a general idea."`
`".........Rosa, forgive me.`
` Forgive me for sending the sister you hated down to your hell...!!"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, look out!!!"`
`Rudolf pointed the unforgiving barrel of his gun at the witch who claimed to have once been his sister.`
`{n}But Belphegor could not permit that, and savagely attacked.`
`She sprung at him, vanished, and got behind him.`
`If he dodged that attack, she got behind him again.`
`She vanished over and over, each time teleporting into Rudolf's blind spot.`
`It was almost like she was a fairy.`
` As she blinked in and out of vision, Belphegor incessantly drove towards Rudolf.`
`"This might be kinda fun in its own way.`
` Rudolf, let me leisurely watch and see how long your brave efforts last you.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`Then, a dull tearing sound and Rudolf's cry of anguish intermingled.`
`Rudolf had finally reacted too slowly in his dance with the purple trail which pressed upon him,`
` and he had let it lightly cut him on his side.`
`A single wound delayed a single one of his actions.`
`That caused a new wound, which delayed him from acting again.`
`Belphegor's dance began to swallow Rudolf whole...`
`Watching Rudolf's body gradually get carved up, his former sister let out a shrill laugh.`
`Leviathan could no longer hide her irritation that Kyrie was absolutely refusing to allow her to deliver a fatal wound.`
`".........I really am dense.`
` ...Among the Seven Sisters, I was always the slowest to grow.`
` I was always slow, always weak, always stupid."`
`"......That inferiority complex became envy,`
` and when I converted that into power, I gained a strength greater than that of any of the other sisters."`
`"It's important to have a moderate inferiority complex when you're a girl.`
` It teaches women about cosmetics and hard work."`
`"I don't like using the limits of my power against mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.`
` ......But I will turn my envy of your ability to completely trust your husband into power."`
`"......I don't like it.`
` Why are you so relaxed when you're fighting for your life?"`
`"......*giggle*.`
` I wonder?"`
`"............I get it.`
` You fully believe that your husband will definitely come to rescue you and will save you.`
` .........Isn't it incredible, that trust of yours.`
` It's worthy of my envy."`
`What kind of trust do we sisters have in each other?`
`We sisters are always looking down on each other, trying to thoroughly lambast each other and turn things from bad to worse...!`
`"I've always been bullied by my sisters.`
` I've always wanted just one of them to become my ally."`
`"......So since you have that single ally,`
` who you can place complete trust in, I feel the strongest envy towards you..."`
`"............Aaah, that composed expression of total belief in your husband...!`
` I can feel my envy giving me power...!!`
` .........I might even exceed it.`
` The speed of sound!!!"`
`Leviathan turned herself into a stake, and the speed of her flight as she attacked was proportional to the strength of her envy.`
`"On that day when my sisters looked down on me,`
` I was jealous from the bottom of my heart of the other six, who had grown quickly!`
` I was jealous for seven days and seven nights!!`
` Behold the power and speed I ultimately gained...!!`
` Die, Ushiromiya Kyrieee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeee!!!"`
`The demon stake exposed her true form, leaping about at a terrible speed.`
` The noise from her colliding with and bouncing off the walls sounded like a machine gun.`
`By now, Kyrie probably couldn't tell whether it was a single stake or a swarm of beetles flying and bouncing around.`
`Leviathan was certain of a greater than 100% chance of victory, from the bottom of her heart...!`
`Then, Kyrie spoke with an unbelievably calm voice.`
`".........I was the one who had been going out with Rudolf‐san from the very beginning.`
` ......Asumu‐san shamelessly cut in between us,`
` ...and calculatingly got herself pregnant."`
`"......I don't blame Rudolf‐san.`
` That woman manipulated him using her body as a weapon,`
` and cornered him into a situation where he was forced to become engaged to her."`
`Asumu‐san was carrying Battler‐kun.`
`And at the same time, I was also carrying a boy.`
`...As fate would have it, our delivery dates were on the same day.`
`"And Asumu‐san gave birth to Battler‐kun.`
` ...But I was not so lucky.`
` .........There's something I've thought about.`
` What if Asumu‐san had been the unlucky one, and I had been the one to give birth?"`
`"......Would Rudolf‐san have broken off his engagement and married me?`
` ......But I couldn't birth a child.`
` So until Asumu‐san died,`
` and until I got pregnant with Ange, I cursed Asumu‐san, and was jealous of her."`
`Asumu‐san should just die.`
`And then I want him to remarry, with me... In my envy, I kept cursing her like that, over and over, until Asumu‐san finally died.`
`I became certain.`
`I became certain that I possessed the power of magic, and that it had become a curse which had killed Asumu‐san.`
`But that did not quell the flames of my envy.`
`Don't tell anyone, alright?`
`Every time I look at Battler‐kun, I remember that woman.`
`And every time I look at Battler‐kun,`
` ...I think that if only my child had been born, he would be the same age.`
`I am still jealous of her, tormented by her.`
`Now, and forever.`
` For all eternity.`
`"You say that you were jealous of your sisters for seven days and seven nights...?"`
`"Th‐......that's right..."`
`Don't make me laugh, you little brat.`
`".........How could you understand the madness of a woman...`
`whose man was stolen from her, and who has burned with envy for eighteen years...!!"`
`"U‐......uoawa{0}aaa{0}aAAa{0}a{0}aaAA{0}AAHHH!!!!"`
`If Leviathan's power had 24 hours × 7 days, or 168 hours' worth of speed...`
`Then the power that Kyrie had accumulated...`
`was 24 hours in 1 day,`
` 365 days in 1 year,`
` and for 18 whole years......`
`Even without counting leap years,`
` it was 157,680 hours.`
`...Compared to Leviathan's power and speed,`
` it was more than 938 times greater.`
`So then, even if Leviathan was soaring at the speed of sound, {nobreak:1,225 km/h},`
` ......to Kyrie's eyes, it only looked like...`
`1/938 of that.`
`So then, so then, 1225÷938 is...`
`.........a speed of...`
`1.30 km/h.`
`...They say that a human's walking speed is 4 km/h, so it was even less than half of that.`
` Almost the same speed as a baby crawling on the floor.`
`So then, so then, so then...!`
`In unit time slowed so much you could count all the bits of dust floating through the air,`
` Kyrie looked at the demon stake with pity.`
`She pitied the slowness at which it came towards her.`
`And she lazily raised the barrel of her gun.`
`{n}Almost as though she was trying to swallow the demon stake up with the gun barrel.`
`"You're completely lacking in both love and envy."`
`"......Come back when you're older, darling."`
`"Rudolf, what happened to all that vigor from a couple seconds ago?`
` {ruby:Sliced live fish:Ikezukuri} is best served while it's still twitching.`
` After it dies, it isn't interesting in the slightest.`
` That's enough.`
` Why not kill him now and forever?!"`
`".........kh, ......damn it......"`
`"I'm surprised you managed to endure this long after being carved up."`
`"......That's enough.`
` You don't need to think about anything more.`
` I'll steal your life away painlessly...!"`
`"Wait... Do me a favor.`
` In the very end, I want to do one of those..."`
`"......What do you mean, one of those?"`
`"One of those things that westerns made famous.`
` That thing where we put our backs together, walk three steps, and then {i:bang}."`
`"............Ah, a duel.`
` Very well.`
` If that will satisfy your regrets in this world, I'll accept."`
`Rudolf raised his wound‐covered body, and turned his back to her.`
`Belphegor responded, and faced her back to his.`
`...Belphegor had a sense of integrity that was uncommon in a witch's furniture.`
`"Let me warn you.`
` Even if you press the barrel of your gun between my eyebrows,`
` I can teleport even faster than you could pull the trigger and have the bullet reach my skull."`
`"......Yeah, I'm already feeling that throughout my body.`
` ...You are faster than a bullet."`
`"I have agreed to this out of respect for your courage in challenging me to a duel despite that knowledge.`
` Thank me."`
`"......You are a person of integrity.`
` And a good woman.`
` You might just steal my heart away."`
`"Let's get this started.`
` Three steps is fine?"`
`".........First, one step."`
`"......Two steps."`
`"......Three steps.`
` Is that alright?"`
`"Yep.`
` ......And, since you still haven't noticed after walking three whole steps,`
` ......looks like I win, girl."`
`"Whaaat......?"`
`"...........................Ah...h...!"`
`Rudolf turned around and fired off a bullet.`
`......Of course, Belphegor could easily see through the speed and trajectory of a bullet like that.`
`It should have been no problem at all to dodge it.`
`But a spray of fresh blood flew about.`
`......Belphegor had set up an adequate magical defensive barrier.`
`But before an incarnation of anti‐magic power such as that bullet, it was completely meaningless.`
`".........What are you doing?`
` Why'd you get hit...?!"`
`The bullet had hit Belphegor right in the chest.`
` ...The pain from the lead caused her to grimace, as did as the pain from the denial of magic...`
`"......Forgive me.`
` I'm a coward of a man."`
`"..................ku‐`
`...............u..."`
`"Wh‐...What a mood‐killer.`
` To think that someone who is furniture to a witch could be defeated by a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}...!"`
`"Know your shame.`
` Worthless, pathetic...!`
` Why don't you just stay sprawled there and die forever?!"`
`".........Quit it, Aneki.`
` ...This girl could have dodged it.`
` But she didn't."`
`"......She realized that you were in the line of fire.`
` So this girl of integrity took it without dodging, and guarded you.`
` In the very end, she noticed that I was forking the rook and the king."`
`"Spe‐.........spectacular............"`
`"Don't think badly of me.`
` ...I'd planned to accept my fate if you realized while you were taking those three steps."`
`"............Those three steps...`
`were out of...`
`consideration for me, then...`
` .........I didn't even try to think about it.`
` ......I...`
`...was la...`
`zy........."`
`"......You were a good woman.`
` Go to heaven before me and do your makeup.`
` I'll definitely come and talk you up."`
`As Belphegor slowly fell over, ...she lost even the power that kept her in a human form,`
` and she turned as fine as gold dust, and melted into thin air...`
`At that point, Kyrie dashed in.`
`{n}It seemed that she had defeated her pursuer with her own hands.`
`As she pointed the barrel of her gun straight at the witch, she ran up to the wound‐covered Rudolf.`
`"......Are you alright?`
` Were you talking someone up just now?"`
`"Yep, a fine woman.`
` ...No match for you, of course."`
`"............Sorry, Aneki.`
` It's checkmate."`
`The two of them pinned the witch down the barrels of their guns.`
`"............Worthless furniture.`
` ...I can't believe they were beaten by {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} opponents.`
` ...Worthless.`
` Stupid.`
` ...Boring...!"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, we should retreat from this place.`
` ......There is no furniture or barrier to guard against bullets here."`
`"Eheheheh,`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The witch began to let out a muffled laugh.`
`...It surprised not only Rudolf and Kyrie, but Ronove as well.`
`.........Because a situation like this, with two guns pointed at her,`
` was not one that could just be laughed off, even by a witch.`
`But the witch laughed with pleasure.`
`".........Well, it's only natural that it'd be impossible for the Predecessor's worn out furniture.`
` ......I have to have new furniture, suitable for me.`
` I used them out of obligation,`
` ......but I've always hated hand‐me‐downs."`
`As she said that, she looked down at Belphegor's remains, which had turned completely into a pile of gold dust, with disgust.`
`"I don't know what you're talking about.`
` Now put your damn hands up."`
`...Then, the witch obediently raised her hands.`
`But instead of raising her hands because a gun was being pointed at her,`
` it looked more like she was a conductor facing an orchestra, waving her conductor's baton.`
`"Come, arise, furniture suitable for me...!!`
` Not that cheap furniture, much much stronger ones!`
` Cruel ones!!`
` Ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahyahhyahhya!!!"`
`"No funny stuff...!`
` I'll pull the trigger...!"`
`In response to the witch's call, the hall was once again buried in the color of gold.`
`It was a wild dance of brilliantly radiant gold butterflies,`
` ...and felt as though they had been swallowed up by an ocean of gold leaf.`
`Ronove was left shocked at that upsurge in magic power...`
`{n}That was because it far surpassed even that of his former master.`
`As their eyes were dazzled amidst the golden brilliance, a gunshot could be heard.`
`{n}Either Rudolf or Kyrie had fired a round.`
`......And after the golden glow had subsided, there was the witch, looking at least cool and composed.`
`The bullet?`
` Kyrie had definitely fired it into her.`
`But it was not embedded anywhere in the witch's body.`
`There it was.`
` ...The bullet was fastened in midair right in front of the witch's chest.`
`"A, ......a bullet‐proof barrier........."`
`A barrier which took even her predecessor a significant amount of preparation...in an instant...`
`{n}Ronove's face was by now twisted in shock.`
`{n}And the surprise did not stop there......`
`The group of gold butterflies created two humanoid forms.`
`......It was a furniture summoning.`
`The butterflies peeled off and flew away, and beneath them, furniture in the shape of girls showed themselves.`
`"..................The Chiester Sisters troops...`
` .........Even the Predecessor...`
`...wasn't able to summon the Pendragon's Memorial Troops on a moment's notice, and so easily...!"`
`"Chiester{ruby:four‐one‐zero:410}. Right here."`
`"Chiester{ruby:forty‐five:45}. Right here."`
`"...You two {i:are} suitable furniture for me, right?"`
`"From reading you a picture book, to going on a friendship date, to shooting down a meteorite,`
` we'll take care of anything. Nihihi."`
`"I‐if we don't take care of it, the Dragon King will get mad at us...!`
` Please, your orders, Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}!"`
`".........Rudolf‐san.`
` Let's run.`
` These guys are no good......!"`
`"S‐.........sure!"`
`Thanks to the same feeling that had alerted her to the ambush by the Seven Sisters of Purgatory,`
` Kyrie clearly heard warning sirens going off in her head, almost resembling screams.`
`Without hesitation, they ran.`
`As the witch elegantly watched them leave, she ordered her new furniture.`
`"...This is an order.`
` Kill the two who ran away.`
` Then bring the corpses back here.`
` Then I'll bring them back to life, and play with them over and over.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`The witch's expression twisted with an evil smile.`
`Even though she feared that expression, Lucifer appeared and spoke.`
`"M‐...my apologies.`
` ...The Predecessor said to avoid brutal actions of that—"`
`When the witch stared at her with those terrifying eyes, Lucifer was struck dumb.`
`...She was unsatisfied.`
` She was bored, of not being able to let her own power and her own cruelty run wild.`
`......Irritated by her predecessor's furniture telling her to act with restraint, her discontent was at its peak.`
`"Oh, it's Lucifer‐chan the Proud.`
` Long time no see nyeh, how ya doin'?`
` Let's play together again sometime.`
` Nihhihihihihihi!"`
`"F‐...410, you mustn't chat, you'll get in trouble...!`
` Let us carry out the great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}'s order at once...!"`
`"Nihi.`
` Looks like we're on the job right now nyeh."`
`"......410, understood.`
` Preparing for sniping pursuit combat."`
`"Collecting terrain data, collecting firing data.`
` Data link to 410."`
`"410, data received.`
` Target acquired.`
` Correcting for terrain.`
` Forming firing curve, control points adjusted.`
` Data link to 45."`
`"45, data received.`
` Checking danger zone, ......ah, not there!"`
`"You're in the way behind us, Lucifer‐chan,`
` you'll get roasted in the backfire, you know? Nihi!"`
`".........nh..."`
`The Chiester sisters, through their mutual measurements,`
` were able to instantly calculate the terrain inside the mansion and the coordinates of their targets, as well as a firing curve to reach them.`
`...Yes, their shots could be guided to draw a curved line.`
`{n}No one would be able to escape it.`
`The precision homing ability of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory was nothing more than a cheap version of the ability these two held.`
`"45, firing preparations complete.`
` Ammo selected, now loading."`
`The two of them faced each other,`
` and, as though they were both pulling back a bowstring together,`
` ...there, a dazzling golden arrow was readied.`
`"410, nihi.`
` Firing."`
`After they proclaimed that they were firing, together, they released a single arrow.`
`As the curve taken by the gold‐sparkling snake of light drew a trail,`
` it headed in the direction Rudolf and Kyrie had run, in rapid pursuit.`
`It turned through the corridors, crawled over the floor, chasing them as it drew a beautiful curve.`
`No one could block the Chiester Sisters' homing projectiles.`
` No one could escape them.`
` And their strength could pierce all physical and magical defenses.`
`......It was an all‐too‐merciless guided weapon of certain death.`
`However, among mythical‐class soldiers, it was a weapon used by pretty much everyone.`
` It was very commonplace for them, ...and very extraordinary for those of the everyday world.`
`"Wh‐what the...?!"`
`When he noticed something rapidly chasing them, and turned around...`
`Rudolf was shot straight through the location of his heart by the gold snake.`
` It all happened in an instant.`
`"R‐Rudolf‐san......?!"`
`After the gold snake ran Rudolf through,`
` it swooped down to the floor, drawing a beautiful spiral, coiled itself around Kyrie's legs, and crawled up to her chest.`
`And just like Rudolf, it shot straight through the location of her heart.`
`...And all of that, too, happened in an instant.`
`{n}It impaled Rudolf, and it impaled Kyrie.`
`So they died at almost the same time, dropped to their knees at the same time, and fell over at the same time.`
`"......What is thiiis?`
` So overwhelming, ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!`
` That was ridiculously easy, wasn't it?`
` Kuhhihihya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hyahya!`
` This is the kind of furniture I need.`
` Way different from my predecessor's second‐hand furniture!"`
`"Come on, bring their corpses here.`
` I'll keep reviving them until I'm bored, and try killing them in the most brutal ways I can think of.`
` Aaah, to think that being a witch could be so much fun,`
` that taking a life could be so much fun, ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!"`
`......The most shunned action to take for someone born a human is the murder of another human.`
`It's only natural for a human not to understand how pleasurable it is to break this taboo.`
`......But she was no longer a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
`{n}She was a witch.`
`...And there were some pleasures that only witches could understand.`
`By now, she had tasted those pleasures, and was totally immersed in them.`
`...After learning that the contents of the forbidden pot were honey, she could no longer live without it.`
`......No, maybe the contents were honey because they were forbidden.`
`In any case, the act of killing {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s gruesomely,`
` and doing it over and over, was by now giving her a drug‐like pleasure.`
`As the witch rolled over laughing,`
` the gold snake which had just been fired returned as though being hauled back in.`
`The two were stitched at the tip and being dragged along.`
`The witch's order had been carried out.`
`...Rudolf and Kyrie had been killed instantly, and their bodies had been carried back.`
`"Chiester45, 410, execution of orders completed.`
` We await your next order, Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Please, your order...!"`
`"From babysitting, to playing you in online multiplayer,`
` to shooting down a space shuttle, we'll take care of everything.`
` Nihihi!"`
`"............These two are apparently the sacrifices for the fourth twilight and the fifth twilight.`
` So in the end, I need those worthless Seven Sisters,`
` ...oh, I guess they're the Five Sisters now.`
` I need those girls to pierce and gouge the forehead and the chest."`
`"......But I can do that at the very end, and I'm free to play in any way until then, right?`
` Eheheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh!"`
`"Wait wait wait waait.`
` ...Have you already forgotten what I told you?!"`
`"Oh, it's you, Predecessor‐sama.`
` Do you have any complaints?"`
`"Of course I do...!`
` You are doing as you please, are you not?!`
` Why can't you follow my directions?!"`
`"What's wrong with doing as I please, Predecessor‐sama?`
` And I haven't got the slightest desire to deviate from the rules of the ritual."`
`"I'll make sure to clean these two corpses up later, and drive stakes into their forehead and chest."`
`"I, I'm telling you, that is not the problem...!`
` If you act so undignified and cruel, uh,`
` ...umm, some people might take it badly..."`
`"..............................`
` ......You mean, your opponent in that game, who I heard you were fighting with somewhere?`
` Ronove told me."`
`"......C‐curse that blabbermouth.`
` .........Well, to be perfectly honest, that's how it is.`
` I had a complaint that, um,`
` ...it is a little too much, you see?"`
`"It's not like there's any need for them to tell you to pass it on instead of objecting directly to me.`
` ...That person is a coward."`
`".........Well, that person is a resident of, uh, a different world from this one, you see.`
` There's no choice but to use me as an intermediary.`
` Well, anyway, the point is—"`
`"........................`
` ......Which means that this person can't interact with me even if they wanted to.`
` And I can't interact with them even if I wanted to either.`
` Am I correct to understand this as an unrelated person from a world that far away?"`
`"M‐mm.`
` ......By analogy, perhaps you could say these worlds are like two very close parallel lines.`
` The worlds are very nearby, but since they are parallel lines, they will never cross.`
` For the time being, you may view that world in such a manner."`
`"They never cross.`
` Which means...`
`.........that world has nothing to do with me.`
` ...If you're telling me on behalf of that person to show some restraint, please pass this message on to them."`
`"A message?`
` What should I say...?"`
`"It's none of your business, so screw off, you old hag.`
` Why don't you just give up and die forever...?"`
`"..................Wha—"`
`"...Oh, I'm sorry.`
` Since it was a friend of yours, I just imagined that she'd be a woman.`
` By "old hag", I'm definitely not talking about youuu, Predecessor‐sama, so please forgive me.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`When she spoke, the witch was looking straight into Beato's eyes.`
`{n}...Anyone in that place would be able to figure it out just by looking.`
`"............Predecessor‐sama.`
` There is something I find very strange.`
` ...Why do you have to play a game with that person from another world,`
` and have them accept that you are a witch?"`
`"Well, about that,`
` ...that is because making all humans accept the existence of witches is related to perfect control.`
` There was a single holdout, you see, and he just won't accept me as a witch."`
`".........Why is it that you need that {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}'s approval?`
` Witches are witches, and they use magic; why do you need a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}'s acknowledgement for this?"`
`"...Mh, .........well, like I said earlier, that which is called magic is—"`
`"I am a witch.`
` I can use magic without anyone's approval in particular, so what's your point......?"`
`"In this world, right?`
` However, since he will not accept it, umm,`
` ...hmmmm, how should I explain it..."`
`"......I don't need an explanation.`
` After all, isn't this all about a different world that never crosses this one?`
` In other words, it's just as though that world doesn't exist."`
`"...............Whether you're fighting in a game in another world, or talking about your delusions, that doesn't change aaanything.`
` ......I'll say it again.`
` It has nothing to do with me.`
` And I am already a witch."`
`"Predecessor‐sama, somehow or another, it seems that you can't become a witch as long as this person doesn't accept you, but I'm different.`
` Even though no one has accepted me, I am already an excellent witch.`
` .........Since you are my predecessor, I will formally pay you respect,`
` but that is out of good will, not out of duty."`
`"......I do not seek your advice anymore,`
` and I understand clearly what I should do now and how I should play from now on."`
`".........So I will carry out the ceremonial murder of the thirteen people as a final act of respect for you.`
` However, as for the methods I use,`
` and what I do after that, there is absolutely no reason I should be lectured by you on those.`
` ..................Therefore, I'll be counting on you in that regard."`
`At a glance, those words seemed obedient, but they contained within them a clear parting of ways.`
`...They were saying, as clear as could be,`
` "I have no more reason to rely on you, so don't get in the way of my fun".`
`Beato understood that,`
` ...and was dejected, realizing that no matter how she explained it, she wouldn't be able to make the witch understand.`
`"...I, ............I see...`
` Then it is no longer my problem...`
` Go and learn first‐hand how magic ceases to exist when you lose your feelings of respect for it."`
`"......That carefree rampage of yours up until now,`
` I would dearly like to hear how it can be called respect."`
`After hearing that, Beato could not respond.`
` ......Because she remembered hearing exactly the same thing from her master.`
`"So.`
` Chiester Sisters?`
` My predecessor is just leaving, please see her off."`
`"Nihihihihi.`
` Predecessor‐sama, please retire from this place."`
`"I‐if you don't, we'll be scolded...!"`
`Throughout her body, Beato felt something invisible in the Chiester Sisters' eyes which could only be described as an oppressive feeling.`
`......Most likely, they were initiating firing calculations.`
`{n}It was an action much like taking out a gun and cocking it.`
`Even Beato could not escape from the Chiester Sisters' attacks without any preparation.`
`...In the past, she had placed her greatest trust in them, so she knew down to her very soul how terrifying they were.`
`".........Predecessor‐sama, if you would retire.`
` .........I would not recommend damaging {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's mood any further."`
`"......Predecessor‐sama..."`
`"A‐.........alright.`
` ...I shall now take my leave.`
` ......I shall take my time appreciating the circumstances you will put yourself in!"`
`That was as close as you could get to a loser's last retort.`
`...So after Beato hid herself, the witch and her furniture fell over laughing...`
`"............Well, I understand.`
` Endless power is fun.`
` ...The joy of freely toying with a life, the epitome of finite things, cannot be explained to those who have not tasted it.`
` ......I can understand the feeling of being possessed with that pleasure."`
`"......It must have been quite fun.`
` Judging from your antics in the past."`
`"Are you saying it is like how you used to admonish me in the past, Master, and I did not listen...?"`
`".........Why is it that you have started trying to scold that child for her actions?"`
`"Mh, ......umm, well.`
` ........................"`
`"...There is a single large difference between you and that child.`
` That child may already be a witch.`
` Of course, you are also a witch.`
` In the world on top of the game board."`
`"......However, to be accepted as a witch outside the game board,`
` you need to have your opponent in this game, Battler‐kun, accept you.`
` ......You must have understood that when you started the game."`
`"......I thought that if I could show off a whirlwind of proof that I am a witch,`
` blow away his feelings that made him deny me, and break him completely,`
` .........he would accept me as a witch.`
` ...It all went my way last time, so I thought I was just a breath away..."`
`"It's actually the opposite.`
` Battler‐kun was shocked by your brutality.`
` And the reason he stepped up as your opponent was not because he accepted you as an equal opponent.`
` It was based on a strong animosity, as he tried to completely deny the existence of a brutal witch."`
`".........In your foolishness, you probably felt that Battler‐kun considering himself as your opponent...`
`was a first step towards making him accept that you are a witch.`
` However, it was actually the exact opposite."`
`"Battler‐kun challenged you in this game because he definitely would not accept you as a witch.`
` ......No matter how much the thoughtless north wind blew, the traveler only wore his cloak even tighter.`
` You were committing a huge error from the very beginning."`
`"............This game is not torture to break Battler‐kun.`
` It is a test, in which you must work hard to make Battler‐kun accept you."`
`"...............`
` ...I,`
` ......I vaguely, you know,`
` ...realized that..."`
`"Last time, it was a tough game for Battler‐kun.`
` But it seems that you've already noticed.`
` ......This time, the game is tough for you."`
`"Wh‐...what should I do from now on?"`
`"Think about it yourself.`
` ......Fortunately, you have already abandoned being a piece on the game board, and relegated things to the new witch.`
` You should have time to deliberately ponder upon yourself."`
`"............But Battler's already a big ball of hostility.`
` He won't accept witches, and he won't accept me.`
` ......In that case, how do I make Battler accept me, then...?`
` Are you saying that if the north wind doesn't work, ...then I should shine on him as the sun from now on...?`
` {i:I} should, after all this time......?"`
`"It is October now.`
` The Halloween season.`
` .........It is the month of rebirth, when the sun dies and is revived again.`
` When the sun is weak right after reviving, it may pale in comparison to the cold winter winds."`
`"However, it slowly grows, and is eventually able to hail the coming of spring.`
` ...At that time, the traveler may even fold up his cloak."`
`".........So you say...`
`...that I am mistaken........."`
`...The beautiful hall of the Ushiromiya mansion was covered in a glow golden like gold leaf,`
` ...and stained deep red with thick spurts of blood.`
`The number of deaths given to Rudolf and Kyrie had long surpassed anything you could count on both your fingers and your toes.`
`The witch was breathing so hard her shoulders shook, but it wasn't because she was tired.`
`{n}...She just couldn't hide the ragged breathing caused by her still uncontainable excitement.`
`"Ahhahahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!`
` How fun it is to do as I will with the life and death of people!`
` Before the power of the Endless Witch, every one of the infinities I paint with my mind becomes reality!"`
`"No matter how {i:sloppily} I {i:mash} them,`
` I can revive them, returning them to normal with just a snap of my fingers."`
`"Because in the end, I just have to return the corpses to normal and make a token show of following the epitaph.`
` Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"......Hey, you guys,`
` have you ever sliced a stuffed animal's stomach open?"`
`"Never, nihi.`
` What about you, 45?"`
`"N‐no...!`
` I have never done it, my apologies...!"`
`"Of course not.`
` Normally, you wouldn't.`
` ......Especially not if it was a stuffed animal you liked.`
` But I've always thought about it."`
`"I wondered what was packed inside this fluffy stuffed animal that I loved so much,`
` and always thought I'd like to peek inside one day."`
`If you cut it and looked inside, your curiosity might be quelled, but the stuffed animal would be broken.`
`......So even though you want to see, you can't.`
`{n}You understand that feeling, right?`
`"......The power of the Endless Witch can grant exactly that wish.`
` ...As I am now, I can slice the stuffed animal all I want."`
`"......And yet, with a bit of magic, I can revive it back to normal.`
` ...In other words, it means that I have broken all limitations in this world.`
` ......As I am now, I don't have to hesitate, refrain, or anything of the sort."`
`"That joy, ......aah, there's probably no one who can understand it.`
` No one other than me, the Endless Witch!!"`
`As the witch let out a euphoric cry, she revived Rudolf and Kyrie again,`
` and faster than they could realize it, she killed them right away.`
`......As she made it known that something other than cotton was stuffed inside those two.`
`"...G‐`
`............give it a rest, Eva......!"`
`"Huh?`
` ......Ah, you.`
` You're here."`
`In that hall of tragedy, Hideyoshi showed himself, his gun readied.`
`The witch had sealed the mansion with a barrier, so Hideyoshi had nowhere to run.`
`...He had probably picked up Rudolf's or Kyrie's gun, and come back.`
`It seemed that the gun, which should have been something to be feared, was no longer an object she took seriously now that she was overflowing with magic power.`
`Her bold expression didn't flinch in the slightest.`
`".........Why'd you have to kill Rosa‐san and Maria‐chan,`
` ......and Rudolf‐kun and Kyrie‐san......?!"`
`"Huh?`
` I am the head of the Ushiromiya family, and the witch of Rokkenjima.`
` I am free to start whatever I like on this island.`
` ...Just isolating this one instant and asking about their life and death within it is meaningless to me."`
`Hideyoshi was struck speechless by that all‐too‐callous response from the witch.`
` Could someone's personality change so much just by finding Kinzo's gold......?`
`"Just how high was that gold piled?`
` I can't even imagine it.`
` It must have been enough to make you lose your sanity..."`
`"......Still, if there was that much gold,`
` ......why didn't you think of graciously splittin' it up...?!!"`
`"You misunderstand.`
` ............All of that belongs to the Golden Witch.`
` No one is qualified to touch it except for me.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*, ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!"`
`"......What are you?`
` Are you tryin' to say you're that thing Eva told me about long ago......the witch Eva from when she was young?"`
`"That's right.`
` I am me in my youth, who was always living in the heart of your wife, Ushiromiya Eva.`
` ...And I'm a witch.`
` .........Eva became an adult by forgetting me.`
` So she can't use magic."`
`"...Everyone fills their head sometimes with innocent yet cruel fantasies, as kids.`
` Even me, when I was young, I'd sometimes go around steppin' on ants and pullin' the wings off dragonflies.`
` .........But you learn the importance of life, and grow out of that cruel childhood age."`
`"......Right now, you really are a child, y'know!`
` ...A personality that Eva should have outgrown!`
` That's not Eva.`
` It's a different human!!"`
`"That's right.`
` I am not Ushiromiya Eva.`
` I'm the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"It's so fun, not being bounded by any limitations, and the pleasure of being able to do as I will with life and death is truly wonderful...!`
` I don't have to apologize for breaking the goldfish bowl,`
` and I can tear the stuffed animal as much as I want!`
` I—"`
`A dry sound.`
`...It was the sound of Hideyoshi slapping the witch's face.`
`By looking at the hall stained deep red with fresh blood, he should have been able to imagine how terrible the witch was.`
`But without fear, without even hesitating, Hideyoshi had walked determinedly up to her, and hit her on the cheek.`
`"....................."`
`"You dolt!!`
` Don't act like you're cruel, not when you're really a coward and a weaklin'!`
` I'll keep you on the straight and narrow, you wicked woman!!`
` You dumbo!`
` Nitwit!!"`
`"Ow,`
` ......ouch,`
` ...hey...!"`
`"You used to be a woman who understood how important, how fragile a life is!`
` I'll knock some sense back into you...!!`
` What's all this about witches, what a load of crock!!"`
`"You're my wife, Ushiromiya Eva!`
` A witch of the kitchen, thoughtfully whippin' up snacks from leftovers in the fridge, that's the only witch you are!!`
` Open your eyes, you blunderin' dolt...!!"`
`"Didn't I just say...`
`that I'm not Ushiromiya Eva......?!"`
`"That's horsecrap!!`
` You!`
` You!!"`
`As tears dripped down his face, Hideyoshi kept hitting the witch's head.`
`He wasn't even pointing the gun at her anymore.`
`So.`
` That sound of gunfire couldn't have come from the gun Hideyoshi was holding.`
`......The gun, which had fallen in the corner near Rudolf's body, was floating in the air,`
` ...and smoke lingered near the barrel.`
`And the bullet?`
` .........A red stain was slowly spreading across the chest of Hideyoshi's vest.`
`Even though his back was facing the barrel of the gun, ...the bullet was embedded in Hideyoshi's chest.`
`".........E...`
`va............`
` ............uu..."`
`"...I told you, I'm not Eva.`
` What a stupid, annoying man."`
`"......You're a pain, so I'll switch the sacrifice for the sixth twilight to you.`
` ...If you'd just stayed hidden under a bed quivering or something, I'd planned to let you go.`
` ......You deliberately came back.`
` You really are a stupid man."`
`Thunk...`
` There was a dull sound as Hideyoshi fell to the floor.`
`Even though he would be able to escape his pain by dying, he resisted that until the last second,`
` and staring straight into the witch's eyes, ...he passed away.`
`Because he had died without closing his eyes, for a short while, the witch didn't realize that he was dead,`
` and she remained pinned down by that gaze.`
`"Will we make this one a new toy and play?`
` Nihi."`
`At those words, the witch finally realized that Hideyoshi was dead.`
`".........nn, ...ahh.`
` ...Right, what'll we do..."`
`The Chiester Sisters waited for instructions.`
`{n}On the inside, they imagined an order even more brutal than before from their master.`
`But the expression that rose to the witch's face looked as though she had gotten over her excitement.`
`{n}She looked down at Hideyoshi's face, which still had tears dripping down it...`
`"......This guy totally ruined my mood.`
` Yeeeah, I'm done.`
` .........Ronove, you there?"`
`"Yes, right here."`
`"Clean up, please.`
` ...My predecessor will be annoying.`
` Please make it clean enough so that the old hag will accept it. ......And I guess I will follow the rules of the ritual, out of responsibility to my predecessor.`
` Please make these three corpses the fourth twilight through the sixth twilight."`
`"Lucifer, you're up."`
`"Lucifer the Proud, right here."`
`"Dig into these three corpses and gouge them."`
`"I‐...into the corpses?"`
`"That's right.`
` You have a problem with that?"`
`"N‐...no..."`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory had a modest sense of pride.`
` It was the pride of a hunter, the pride of gouging prey that they had brought down themselves.`
`...However, being told to gouge a corpse that someone else had brought down ran contrary to that feeling.`
` Of course, that was not the witch's intention, but for the Seven Sisters, it was horribly humiliating.`
`...However, they had already messed up, with two of the sisters defeated, so they had no right to question her.`
`Only Ronove appreciated that, and he rested his hand on her shoulder in understanding.`
`"......It is {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's order.`
` Lucifer, carry the three, and deal with them according to the protocol of the ritual.`
` Then, when you are done, lend me a hand with the cleanup."`
`"Certainly......"`
`The witch looked down upon Hideyoshi's corpse, as though implying that this somehow weird atmosphere was all Hideyoshi's fault.`
`".........Stupid man.`
` You didn't even have to die."`
`"Honey......!!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!`
` Honey, where are you?!`
` You're there, right?`
` Answer me!!"`
`The sound of a loud thunderbolt woke Eva from her nightmare.`
`If Hideyoshi had been gripping her hand at that time, her fearful heart would probably have been instantly healed.`
`However, Hideyoshi, who had sworn that he wouldn't leave even for a moment, was nowhere to be seen in the room.`
`"Honey,`
` ...answer me...`
` .........Honey...!!`
` Uuuuuhhuuu{0}uuughhhuu!!"`
`...Thirty minutes had already passed since Rudolf's group had left the guesthouse.`
`By any measure, their return was too late.`
`{n}...And Krauss and Natsuhi, who were waiting by the entrance, were by now about as restless as they could stand.`
`The chain was set on the door.`
` That was a precaution in the event that Rudolf's group was attacked, and the master key was stolen from them.`
`For that reason, they needed to wait by the entrance like this for the others to return...`
`"......They really are taking too long.`
` You don't think something happened to them...?"`
`"...............Hmm..."`
`Krauss glanced between the clock and the door, struggling to feign composure.`
`"If...by some chance they were not to return......"`
`"...A terrible thought, but it looks as though we should ready ourselves for that possibility.`
` ......It really was reckless, after all."`
`"Th‐that is what I said...!`
` Why did they go outside when they knew it was this dangerous...!`
` How foolish!`
` Why go outside, even though Rosa‐san had just been attacked...?!!"`
`".........Nothing will come from saying that now.`
` ...In any event, there are now three adults in the guesthouse.`
` Me, you,`
` ......and Eva, who's asleep with a high fever."`
`At that time, there was the forceful sound from the hallway of a door being opened, and Eva's shrieking voice.`
`...That voice kept calling Hideyoshi's name.`
` ......It seemed as though the high fever had given her a bad dream or something, and now she was calling her husband's name.`
`"Eva‐san...`
`what is it, are you alright...?"`
`"Wh‐...where is my husband?!`
` My husband isn't here!!`
` He promised that he'd stay with me the whole time!`
` He promised that he'd hold my hand the whole time!!"`
`...Krauss was taken aback by this attitude of hers, which she had never shown in front of him before, but Natsuhi understood her feelings.`
`"......C‐calm down...`
` Hideyoshi‐san is with Rudolf‐san and Kyrie‐san, and they're outside right now."`
`"Outside?!?!`
` Whwh‐why,`
` he promised that he'd stay with me the whole time,`
` why did he go outside?!`
` You mustn't go outside, the witch is outside, you mustn't go, you'll be killed!!`
` Waaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaagg{0}g{0}g{0}g{0}g{0}gghhh...!!"`
`"...Eva, calm yourself.`
` ......Hideyoshi‐san is back in the mansion with Rudolf and Kyrie‐san."`
`"Why did he have to go to the mansion?!!`
` Why did you let him outside when it's safe in here?!!`
` Why did he go back to the mansion?!!"`
`"..................`
` ......They went to get enough food to last until tomorrow.`
` ...Hideyoshi‐san was worried about your health, and he told us so..."`
`"When will they come back?!`
` When will he come back?!`
` He can't go outside, not to the rose garden, not to the mansion!!`
` The witch is there, the Golden Witch is walking around!`
` If she finds him he'll be killed, he'll definitely be killed!!`
` When will my husband come back?!"`
`".........They left here thirty minutes ago.`
` We are waiting for their return."`
`"Th‐thirty minutes?!`
` That makes no sense, why would it take him so much time to go to the mansion, get food, and come back?!`
` And why are you two just standing around here?!"`
`"We have to go get him!!`
` Quick, we have to go to where he is!!`
` Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!"`
`Eva had probably had quite a nightmare.`
` ...And after waking up and discovering that it still wasn't over, she could no longer hide her confusion.`
`Natsuhi tried calming her down, but it only made Eva's emotions explode all the more.`
`......Maybe they heard that disturbance.`
` The lobby door opened slightly, and Battler and the kids, who should have been upstairs, poked their faces out.`
`Krauss, Natsuhi, Eva.`
` And Battler, George, Jessica, Nanjo.`
`{n}...Everyone in the guesthouse was gathered by the entrance, and understood the current situation.`
`"I agree with Mother.`
` We should go to check on Father and the others."`
`"Yeah, you're right.`
` There's also the chance that their load is too heavy and they're having trouble carrying it.`
` They should welcome some extra hands."`
`"......R‐Rosa‐san was attacked not long ago.`
` ...There's a possibility that this is a second disaster.`
` We should act with caution here and—"`
`"Don't be ridiculous!!`
` Act with caution and {i:what}?!`
` Are you saying we should stand by and let my husband die when he might be praying for help?!`
` I'm going to look, the cowards can stay here!!"`
`Looking agitated, Eva raised her gun.`
`{n}Judging by her expression, it would be useless for anyone to try to stop her.`
`...George, who realized that first, raised his head.`
`"I'll go too.`
` You will too, right, Battler‐kun?`
` The more people, the better...!"`
`"S‐sure!!`
` Auntie Eva, we're coming even if you tell us not to."`
`"...I, I'm coming too...!`
` I'll be damned if I'm gonna be the only one hiding where it's safe...!"`
`"Jessica, you must not go outside!!`
` You are to stay here with me.`
` Do you understand?!"`
`She was essentially implying that those three had already been killed anyway, so it was pointless to go outside.`
`Natsuhi also realized that she had made a deep gouge in Eva's heart, but she said those words strongly as Jessica's mother.`
`"..................You're right.`
` That would probably be best.`
` Nii‐san, you and your family keep watch over the guesthouse."`
`"This is my family's and Battler‐kun's family's problem.`
` And I wonder if Doctor Nanjo would come too.`
` Just in case of the worst."`
`".........In the hall of the mansion, Battler, Eva, George, and Nanjo...`
`found the bodies of Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi."`
`".........The fourth twilight through the sixth twilight?`
` Then, the corpses were pierced through the forehead, chest, and stomach with those demon stakes?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......Into Rudolf's forehead,`
` into Hideyoshi's chest,`
` and into Kyrie's stomach: one demon stake buried into each."`
`"The clothing on all three was disordered, and because of this, it is thought that they had been fighting or running away.`
` Since the three bodies were not found right next to each other, it is hypothesized that after coming into contact with the culprit, they attempted some form of resistance."`
`".........With stakes, in the forehead, chest, and stomach.`
` ......Horrible, just like usual..."`
`"................................."`
`Even though Ronove knew it would be superfluous, he thought that maybe he should tell Battler.`
`...In actuality, the witch had killed them in a much more horrible way.`
`......Beato had advised the witch to restrain herself, which was why the corpses had been left so undamaged.`
`The new and brutal witch, thinking that all she needed to do was get the "gouged with a stake" part right,`
` ......might even have just stuck a stake into a lump of meat that wasn't even shaped like a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
`Rosa's and Maria's corpses would probably have been especially striking.`
` ...If they had been killed as the Golden Witch had wished, just how gruesome would the exposed corpses have been?`
`Beato had changed that into a kind of killing that Battler would have called "still better".`
`Wanting to have Beato's small bit of thoughtfulness appreciated, he thought of telling Battler about that.`
`...But, for Battler, that might do more harm than good.`
` To humans, the gap between being alive and being dead is very large.`
`To ask for Beato's feelings to be accommodated on the grounds that she had changed it to a better way of dying...`
`might have made it possible for a demon to pardon her, ......but there was no way it would work the same way for a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
`Understanding this, Ronove remained silent even though he knew of Beato's modest effort...`
`"Just like usual, let's start by checking whether the corpses are dead.`
` ......Ronove, please, declare it in red."`
`"...................................."`
`"Hey, can't you hear me?`
` ...Please, declare it in red.`
` This is a repetition request.`
` "Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi are dead"."`
`"...............My apologies.`
` Allow me to decline from repeating that."`
`"What...?`
` That's so sudden... What are you planning...?"`
`By now, proclaiming the death of the victims in red was almost a given in this battle.`
`Refusing to do that was almost like losing by default.`
`...So when Ronove declined as his first move, Battler was dumbfounded.`
`"My apologies.`
` I hereby humbly relinquish my right to be Milady's agent.`
` ...Accordingly, {i:I} cannot repeat that in red.`
` ......The only one qualified to repeat that...is Milady."`
`"........................"`
`"...It is a valid point.`
` Ronove is but an agent for Beato's side.`
` ......If Ronove steps down from the position of agent, and Battler‐kun will not accept Beato as an opponent,`
` ...a new agent must be created."`
`"......There is no new agent.`
` ......Please, Battler‐sama.`
` Please accept Milady as your game partner once more."`
`"............Sorry,`
` but that's not happening.`
` ......I definitely won't accept that unpleasant, ruthless bitch as my opponent.`
` ...Refusing to accept that is the reason I won't abandon this game."`
`"Regarding your point about Milady being unpleasant, I apologize in her stead.`
` I shall obtain Milady's pledge that she will not take unpleasant actions again."`
`"..............................`
` ......Yeah, right."`
`"...Battler‐kun.`
` ...I also apologize as that child's master.`
` I will give her a thorough talking‐to, so would you please forgive her just this once?"`
`"......Hey, hey, quit that.`
` You're making it sound like I'm the bad guy."`
`"...And no matter how much {i:you guys} apologize, it won't reach my ears.`
` ......If Beato can say that from her own mouth,`
` ............well, it's not like I'm not gonna listen to her."`
`"............Alright.`
` If that is the only condition under which you will accept that child again, let us have her apologize."`
`".........Ronove.`
` Call for that child.`
` Is that alright, Battler‐kun...?"`
`"...............Tch.`
` ...Do whatever you want.`
` But don't expect me to forgive her.`
` ......Go on, call for that irritating witch."`
`"...You have my thanks, Battler‐sama.`
` .........I will call her now.`
` ......Milady, Battler‐sama is calling for you."`
`After a few heartbeats, gold butterflies gathered together in midair and created Beato's form.`
`...It was much more docile than the way she had appeared before now.`
`"............Did you call, Ronove?"`
`"...I believe you heard.`
` ......Is there anything you have to say, from your own mouth...?"`
`"...................................."`
`".............................."`
`It looked as though Beato shrunk slightly under Battler's cold gaze.`
`Several times, Beato made an effort to get the words out of her mouth, but that didn't work so well,`
` ......and she was just as awkward as someone trying to light a match during a freezing winter with frozen hands...`
`Even as she did that, the game board was proceeding...`
`In the hall, they had just found the bodies of the new victims, and had broken down crying...`
`"......Dad,`
` ......Kyrie‐san...`
` ...UooOO{0}O{0}O{0}OOoo{0}ooO{0}OOo{0}oohhhh...`
` UOOOOooo{0}ooOO{0}OOoo{0}oohhhhh..."`
`"Oh honey, ...honeyyyy... uuu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}huu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}uughhhu{0}uuhu{0}uhuu...!!"`
`"...Mother,`
` ......stay strong......`
` ......You're not the only one who's...`
`...crushed and...`
`...sad......!"`
`"........................They probably died instantly.`
` ...Even if we had arrived immediately after they fell, I am sure that it would have been too late..."`
`"No, it wouldn't!!`
` He would definitely have been alive!!`
` His chest was stabbed with this thing...!`
` My husband must have died in extreme pain...!!"`
`"If we had come faster, ...he would have been saved, I just know it!`
` I just know it!!`
` Uuuuuwa{0}aAAAaa{0}aaAA{0}AAaa{0}aa{0}aahhh..."`
`"...Battler‐kun... I know it's horrible, but......you have to stay strong......"`
`"...............I'm fine, ...I really am, Aniki...`
` ...Let me cry just a bit longer...`
` ......Compared to you people, this is nothing...`
` I should be the least sad...!`
` So if you let me cry just a little longer, ......I'll be fine..."`
`"That isn't true...`
` ......I can understand how much it must be hurting your heart to have lost both parents...`
` ...I still have my mother.`
` ...I've got it much better than you, Battler‐kun..."`
`"No, you haven't!!`
` You have it the worst, George‐aniki...`
` ......I understand, Aniki..."`
`"...Out of all of us, ...you're the most devastated, and the most in pain!!`
` I know that...`
`so I can't keep on snivelling like this...!!`
` Uuu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}uughhu{0}uugh!!"`
`"......Why......do you say that......?"`
`"To me, Dad and Kyrie‐san......were people I'd eventually part with when I became an independent adult.`
` Since they're parents, it's fated that they'd die before their children.`
` ...It's just that it happened a little early...!"`
`".........But it's not like that for you, Aniki.`
` You didn't just lose a parent you'd part with eventually.`
` .........You also lost someone you should have lived your whole life with,`
` ............you lost Shannon‐chan as well...!!"`
`"......................................."`
`"It's not like human lives have different weights.`
` Whether it's a baby or an old person, they're all just as precious...!"`
`"......But still, the longer the life they had in front of them,`
` ...the longer the future you'd have built together, ............the sadder their death is......!!"`
`"Aniki, you were engaged to Shannon‐chan, weren't you?`
` You promised that you'd build a life and a home together in the future, didn't you?!`
` .........Compared to how huge that future was, ...compared to how huge that happiness was,`
` ......my pain doesn't even come close...!!"`
`".........No one would blame you for crying so, so much more...!!`
` And yet, ...just because you're like a big brother to us cousins,`
` .........you force yourself to act like everything's all OK......!!"`
`"..................Stop it, ...Battler‐kun."`
`George was trying to make a calm smile.`
`......But.........he couldn't, any longer, stop a single hot tear from leaving a streak down his face.`
`"......How could I possibly...`
`......not be sad...?`
` .........I think of Shannon, and all the futures we imagined together.`
` We talked of so many dreams, the hundred years of our human lives would never have been enough to make them all come true."`
`"......Of those dreams,`
` not even the very first one,`
` ............having her move into my family register... We couldn't even have that...`
`......so how could I possibly...`
`.........not be sad.........?"`
`"Compared to that, I, ......I...!!`
` Like I said, I have no right to cry any more!`
` When even you're holding back, Aniki, what right do I have to shed any more tears?!"`
`"......We're the same.`
` ...Both of us feel the exact same sadness from losing the ones we love.`
` .........So there's nothing saying you don't have the right to cry compared to me."`
`".........And...`
`...there's nothing saying...I have to hold back {i:my} tears...any longer either."`
`"...Aniki, ......Anikii...!!!`
` UOO{0}Oo{0}o{0}ooHhh{0}hhO{0}OoOhh{0}hgghhh!!"`
`"Shannon and I always talked about our future together...and now she's dead.`
` And my dad, he's dead too.`
` .........It hurts, ......it really hurts...`
` ......uuu{0}uuhuu{0}huu{0}huu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}uugh{0}hh{0}uuughh!!"`
`As Battler and George tightly hugged each other, they cried a waterfall of tears over each other's shoulders for those people important to them...`
`"............Do you understand why I said that George‐aniki is the most in pain...?"`
`"I, ......I was listening, so I understand.`
` ......The sadness is proportional to the length of time that would have been spent together in their lives after that..."`
`"......Of course, you can't calculate it just like that though.`
` .........We {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s aren't like you witches.`
` ......We have a finite time we're alive to the moment we die, and we live it with our utmost strength."`
`".........I can't forgive anyone who makes light of that.`
` ......Never mind someone who sneers at it and toys with it.`
` ...A person like you, whose very concept of death is all screwed up, probably can't understand that."`
`"......................................."`
`"......It isn't just the length of time we'd live afterwards.`
` ......Sneering at the lives of people living with all their strength...`
` That's...what I can't forgive the most."`
`"George‐aniki has gone through his life hell‐bent on doing his best.`
` ...He must have shown up today with heroic determination in order that he could marry Shannon‐chan.`
` ......It's completely different from me, a guy who was just feeling happy to be able to meet his cousins again for the first time in ages."`
`"...B‐.........But still—"`
`"Beato.`
` For now, stay silent and listen."`
`"............M‐...mm."`
`".........In a way, I do understand where you're coming from.`
` ...You say that you need to continue murdering according to that weird epitaph for your own resurrection."`
`"......So if I keep the circumstances of your position in mind,`
` ......I can just barely understand your murders.`
` ......Because for you, that is a necessary action.`
` ......In that case, all further unnecessary actions are your own meaningless cruel hobby."`
`"......In other words, if killing six people for the first twilight is a "necessary action" for you,`
` ...all that show of crushing their faces and splitting their stomachs and stuffing them full of sweets is your own, completely unnecessary,`
` preference for cruelty.`
` .........I absolutely cannot forgive this aspect of you."`
`"........................m...mm......"`
`"When Auntie Rosa was repeatedly killed in horrible ways,`
` ......you said, "she'll be brought back to life in the end, so it doesn't matter how she kills her",`
` ...or something like that, I hear.`
` {f:5:Virgilia} told me."`
`".........That was...`
`...well...`
`umm........."`
`"That idea that you can kill them as many times as you want, as long as you bring them back to life in the end,`
` is a completely unnecessary action of toying with a life, isn't it?"`
`".........If you're going to kill them, get it over with!`
` Don't toy with them!!`
` If you aren't going to kill them, then don't tease them!!`
` You're taking advantage of the fact that you can do as you will with people's lives, and you've forgotten the sanctity of life.`
` So I can't accept you...!"`
`"I definitely can't accept as my opponent a person who doesn't know the weight of a life, and the sadness when that life is lost!"`
`"...............That is why the Endless Magic is known as a black art.`
` ...An Endless Witch has no concept of the finite.`
` ......They have no concept of the finite, of the end that is implied by breaking and killing."`
`"...For that reason, Endless Witches sometimes treat the gap between life and death as if it was a Chinese jump rope,`
` and start jumping back and forth over it."`
`".........That is a very, very frightening thing.`
` That is why, as an Endless Witch, and out of my own desire,`
` {i:I never reached your level}."`
`{f:5:Virgilia} had told Beato that countless times before.`
`But Beato had been too young to obediently listen to those words.`
` She had been too wild.`
` ...She had been possessed by that...detestable pleasure.`
`"......I had always been told not to break vases.`
` ......But that's what made me want to break them someday."`
`".........Then, when I gained the Endless Magic,`
` ...and I learned that I could fix it back to normal no matter how much I broke it,`
` ......I was surprised at how fun it was to break a vase..."`
`"That is called the forbidden honey.`
` People are not captivated by what's inside.`
` They are captivated by the lock that seals it.`
` .........It truly is deplorable."`
`".........I want to ask you, {f:5:Virgilia}.`
` Why does this thing called the Endless Magic exist?`
` ...For what purpose does it exist in this world?"`
`"It is not limited to the Endless Magic.`
` ...All magic exists to bring happiness to the human world."`
`"......After everything that has happened, it may be difficult for you to believe, Battler‐kun, ......but we witches train in order to bring blessings to the human world,`
` to become a bridge between humans and those who are not human."`
`"......How the hell does reviving the dead and torturing them to death over and over again help the human world?"`
`"When a vase that is an important memento is broken,`
` if by fixing it everyone will regain their smiles, I would repair it with magic as many times as necessary.`
` However, I would not be fixing it in order to break it again.`
` ......I would be reviving it to give humans happiness."`
`"In that case,`
` ............Beato.`
` You fail as an Endless Witch."`
`"..............................h......mmm..."`
`"......There's something that's just come to me.`
` .........Why do I keep going on with this strange game against you?"`
`"......Maybe this isn't a game to make me submit.`
` ......Couldn't it be a test for you to be accepted as an Endless Witch, {i:in its true meaning}?"`
`"...I, .........I don't know about that.`
` ...The reason I proposed this game to you was, umm, ......simply as a way to kill time...`
` There was no one's ulterior motive."`
`"Just now, I heard the definition of a witch from {f:5:Virgilia}.`
` By that definition, you, Beato,`
` are not even a witch.`
` You'd be an apprentice who's in the middle of her training, and who misunderstands her own power."`
`"......This was supposedly a fight between a witch and a human.`
` In that case, someone like you, who isn't a witch, is not qualified to be my opponent.`
` .........Understand?"`
`"......I am still...`
`.........only an apprentice,`
` ......you say......`
` Then, when will I be accepted as your opponent once again?`
` ......When can we resume this game?"`
`"..................Who knows.`
` ...At the very least, it isn't now.`
` ......When you fully understand what I've said, and become a real witch,`
` ...I will probably accept you as my opponent in this game once more."`
`"I, I can't understand if you say it so abstractly like that...`
` Clearly tell me what I should do to earn your forgiveness..."`
`"No, I've said enough.`
` You think about the rest.`
` .........I've said everything I want to say.`
` ...If you can't understand it, try talking with {f:5:Virgilia} and Ronove.`
` ...A brat like you should start off by listening to what the adults say."`
`".........{f:5:Virgilia}.`
` I will suspend the game for now.`
` Now that Ronove has stepped down as representative,`
` all we can do is wait for Beato to gain the qualifications of a proper opponent."`
`"......Understood.`
` ......Until Beato has been accepted as having gained those qualifications, the game will proceed without an opponent.`
` Is that alright with you too, Beato?"`
`"...I, ......I have no objections.`
` .........I want time, and a place where I can think at a leisurely pace.`
` ...May I take my leave now?"`
`".........Yeah, sure."`
`"...Well then, see you...later."`
`"Wait.`
` ......Don't make that dejected face."`
`"........................Sorry about that.`
` Letting everything inside my heart show up on my face is part of my personality.`
` I cannot deceive."`
`"In that case, there's hope for you yet.`
` .........Let me promise you one thing.`
` In this game with you, I might win, and I might lose.`
` ......It's also possible that it'll be a victory by default for me if you don't come back."`
`At that point, Battler stopped talking for a second.`
`{n}...Then he spoke forcefully.`
`".........However, I definitely won't be the one to step down.`
` I definitely won't give you a victory by default.`
` ......I will keep on waiting here, for you to sit there again as my worthy opponent."`
`"......Battler‐sama..."`
`"...............Thank you,`
` Battler.`
` ...I will definitely come back and be accepted by you."`
`Beato showed him a very slightly hopeful smile, and disappeared.`
`...Looking at that expression, Battler strongly believed that her face could tell no lies...`
`The seven survivors returned to the guesthouse once again.`
`{n}By now, it was clear that those who went outside would not be able to return alive.`
`Rudolf's group had gone out holding two guns and one master key.`
` But those had been lost.`
`It was more than clear by now that they had been stolen by the culprit.`
`Since the windows were closed with the shutters, they wouldn't open even if the culprit had the master key.`
`They sealed the front door and all other doors to the outside with chains,`
` and further blocked them with sofas and tables.`
`Even if the culprit decided to break in through violent means, it wouldn't be easy for them.`
`"......At this point, the typhoon may actually be fortunate.`
` If it were clear outside, it might have been possible for them to set fire to the guesthouse."`
`"If there wasn't a typhoon in the first place, the boat would have arrived before noon.`
` I'm not sure you can call that a cloud's silver lining."`
`"......Eva‐san, how are you feeling physically?`
` Please, try to take it easy."`
`"Thank you.`
` ...I still have a temperature, but now isn't the time to be saying things like that.`
` ......Now is not the time to be stuck in bed, for the children's sake as well."`
`After crying so much in front of Hideyoshi's body,`
` Eva had now gained a strong self‐awareness that she was a mother, and her expression conveyed a strong will.`
`...Actually, her fever still hadn't gone down.`
`And she was aware of that.`
` Whenever she wasn't galvanizing herself, she felt the fever starting to make her mind hazy again.`
`By this point, the first floor was a final line of defense made by Krauss, Natsuhi, and Eva.`
`{n}The children and the guest, Nanjo, had been strongly warned not to carelessly come downstairs.`
`If the culprit used a ladder or something, it probably wouldn't be impossible for them to attack from upstairs.`
`But it wouldn't be easy for them to break those sturdy shutters from such an unstable position.`
` It was comparatively safer upstairs compared to downstairs.`
`Battler and George had hoped to remain downstairs as well, to fight in the worst case scenario, but Eva had rejected that.`
`In her mind, George was now her only family.`
`{n}It seemed that she didn't even want to expose him to the danger of coming downstairs to the first floor.`
`Krauss and Natsuhi could also understand that feeling.`
`......A great deal of time had now passed since they once again barricaded themselves in.`
`In the cousins' room upstairs, Battler, George, and Jessica were sitting dazed,`
` their ears not even registering the TV that had been left on.`
`For a while, Nanjo had been with them, and had tried to send them words to cheer them up,`
` but when he realized that he might actually be having the opposite effect, he disappeared into his own upstairs room.`
`George kept looking dazedly at the photographs inserted in his notebook.`
`......They were from that time he had taken a vacation to Okinawa with Shannon.`
`Shannon's happy smile was contained in those photographs.`
`......George could remember the temperature and the humidity, the warmth and strength of the wind,`
` and even what he had been talking about with her at the time those photos had been taken, as clearly as though it had been yesterday.`
`So to George, they weren't simply photos,`
` but a door to bring back warm memories...`
`In this room, even though the sound of the typhoon and the TV should have entered George's hearing,`
` ......it was the scenery of Okinawa he had seen with her, and her laughing voice, that reached his eyes and his ears...`
`After meeting Shannon, George had made the decision to be reborn.`
`He had sworn to separate himself from the timid person he had once been:`
` easily caught up in the atmosphere, unable to refuse a request, and easily used by those around him.`
`......He had resolved himself to become a strong man who would make her life even more joyous.`
`So.`
` ...If he hadn't met Shannon,`
` ......the man called Ushiromiya George would probably have lived a very different life.`
`And the George of that different life surely wouldn't have been as excellent a man as he now was.`
`The way he was now, he was for the sake of Shannon.`
` ......But if that same Shannon was now gone,`
` ...he found himself wondering why he exists.`
`Isn't it completely meaningless?`
`...A deep, deep sadness, as though he himself had become empty.`
`That feeling had tormented him the whole time.`
` ......However, until Battler had told him, he hadn't been aware of the feeling himself.`
`......He finally remembered...that he should have cried much, much more.`
`So he had cried.`
` Just like Battler, he had cried himself dry.`
`......By now, his eyes were bright red and swollen, and he could not cry any more.`
` So George did his best to change his way of thinking.`
`He decided to think that he was not meaningless, ...that he should be grateful to Shannon for giving him such a character.`
`Dead lives are not revived.`
` He would have to get over being separated from his beloved.`
`If he were to come after Shannon by killing himself, she would surely be deeply dejected.`
`......It would be the same the other way around, too.`
` If he died, and Shannon chased after him, throwing away her own life, he wouldn't be able to forgive himself.`
`......So he chose to surpass his emotions of sadness and anger,`
` .........and decided to thank her.`
`Meeting Shannon had made his days rich and full,`
` ...and had taught him the meaning of working hard for other people's sakes.`
`As a result, she had shaped him into the person he had wanted to be.`
`{n}...He thought he should thank her for that.`
`By doing that, he tried to quell his sadness.`
`{n}But each time he did, he remembered Shannon's smile...`
`.........He knew it, logically.`
`He understood that grieving any more than this would only make her grieve in heaven,`
` ......yet he couldn't stop his sadness...`
`"Why...`
`......does people dying...`
`...make us this sad..."`
`Battler muttered.`
`{n}...It was as though he was speaking on behalf of all humans.`
`He probably hadn't been asking anyone, but Jessica answered.`
`"......Partings are always sad, no matter what they're like."`
`"...But, when, for example, the person is old, or there's some time it's going to happen,`
` ...when it's expected in advance, and you know it's a farewell that must come sooner or later,`
` ...you can spend a long time softening the blow of that sadness.`
` ......Sudden misfortune is probably sad...because you aren't allowed even that..."`
`"...............I see, yeah.`
` ...Sure, if they get sick or something, and end up bedridden in a hospital for several years, you might be able to ready yourself for it bit by bit,`
` ...but when it happens suddenly some day, you don't have that much time."`
`"...The sadness which you should normally spend several years softening closes in on you all at once.`
` .........No wonder it's tough.`
` ......Sometimes, it might even cause a sadness great enough to leave a scar for life..."`
`"......Enough to leave a scar for life, ...you say."`
`"......It's like Grandfather's occult hobby.`
` That was what they whispered about it.`
` ......That maybe {f:5:Beatrice} was his lover, who died a long time ago, and he was so sad that he couldn't pull himself together."`
`"......And that's why he started sacrificing the rest of his life to research of the occult, in order to revive the dead.`
` ......That's what they said."`
`"In that case, Grandfather succeeded in that miracle in his last moments.`
` ......The culprit would be the revived {f:5:Beatrice}, with Grandfather being reunited with her at the moment he was killed.`
` ......Pretty ironic that he revived her, only then to be killed by her."`
`"............Even so, Grandfather was probably able to meet her.`
` ...He gambled half of his life, and even though it was only for a short time,`
` he was probably reunited with the woman he wished to see once again."`
`"...Except he got totally roasted.`
` Probably wanted a bit more than that out of half a life's research."`
`"I wouldn't say that.`
` .........Even if it was only for an instant,`
` ......Grandfather must have been happy to be reunited with the woman he loved."`
`".........Even if his sin of defying life's providence was punished by God,`
` and his body was burnt and sent down to hell,`
` ...and even if the reunion he got in return only lasted a very short time..."`
`"George nii‐san......"`
`"......I wouldn't care if I met with the wrath of God and had my body burned.`
` .........Even if it was just for a short amount of time,`
` ......if I could revive Shannon again,`
` ..................I would sacrifice the rest of my life to the same research as Grandfather."`
`"......Five minutes would be enough,`
` ......I just want to talk with Shannon again...`
` ......Even one minute would be fine......`
` ......In exchange, ...I wouldn't mind......sacrificing the rest of my life......!"`
`".........Aniki......"`
`When Battler and Jessica realized that their pointless discussion was hurting George, they had no choice but to shut their mouths...`
`......George directed his thoughts at Kinzo's life:`
`I saw him sacrifice half of his life to research that no one could understand.`
`......And, on the last day of his life, he revived the person he loved most,`
` ......and probably succeeded in his reunion in his final moments.`
`I don't know how much time they were able to spend together.`
` ...I don't know whether they were given an hour, ...or just five minutes.`
`However, ......in that moment, all of that time he had sacrificed for his research must have been rewarded.`
` ...Even though he spent decades to gain it, that small amount of time must have been enough to reward him.`
`Until today, I never believed in the occult or magic or anything.`
`{n}Somewhere in my heart,`
` ...I even made fun of Grandfather's research as nothing more than an indulgence.`
`However,`
` ......I won't make fun of it anymore.`
`{n}...No, to the contrary, I strongly believe that it does exist.`
`...If that power of belief can become miracles,`
` I'll probably throw away all of my studies up until today,`
` and spend the rest of my life from today onwards studying magic.`
`.........Give me the power of magic.`
`...And...a miracle which lets me meet Shannon again...`
`"....................................`
` ......Haha, ...ha.`
` ...Sorry, you two.`
` I must be going mad.`
` ......If you could revive the dead with magic,`
` ......people would probably be studying it everywhere around the world."`
`"...But things like that don't exist in reality.`
` No one studies it.`
` .........That's because...they know...that the dead can't be brought back with magic."`
`"............Sorry for saying such weird things.`
` It's my fault that the atmosphere here has gotten so strange.`
` ...Sorry for making you worry about me, even though this is hard on everybody."`
`...Even though I did it to divert myself from my sadness, maybe I did say something strange.`
`If I keep talking about something so weird, I'm sure it won't heal their sadness...`
`But, even so, ...that doesn't mean that I can withstand this silence.`
`"......I'll go downstairs, and get another cup of coffee.`
` ......My mother is very particular about how to make a cup of coffee.`
` Does anyone want a refill?"`
`Battler‐kun and Jessica‐chan lightly shook their heads.`
`{n}Without being any more persistent than that, I took my mug and left the room.`
`I did visit Doctor Nanjo's room to ask whether he wanted any more coffee as well,`
` but he too said that he didn't want any more.`
`......It seemed as though my mother's orthodox method of making coffee wasn't universally appreciated.`
`One time, I had Shannon drink some that I brewed by that method,`
` ......but she told me that while it was delicious, it was a little strong,`
` if I remember her words...`
`"............Shannon........."`
`It's no good...`
` ......Even though I left the room to change my mood,`
` ...that image of Shannon's face that's filling my head hasn't faded in the slightest...`
`The fun days I shared with her were becoming more and more vivid,`
` ............and I felt saddened that I was not even allowed to see her dead face.`
`According to our parents, it seems as though she was killed with something like a gun or spear.`
`...I'm sure they were just trying to console me, ......but they had said that her face in death had been very beautiful and peaceful.`
`I wonder if she's...wearing the engagement ring I gave her last night?`
`......If she accepted my engagement, she should have it on the ring finger of her left hand...`
`Last night, our heads were both full of each other, and we weren't composed at all.`
`Shannon had accepted the engagement semi‐boldly,`
` but she might have regretted that as a rash action once she cooled her head.`
` She might have taken the ring off.`
`......I wonder if she has the ring on now.`
`......I at least want to be sure of that much.`
`{n}I want to know...her final feelings......`
`However, ......even if I do check that, ...it's not as if she'll be revived.`
`...............I wonder what will happen to her body.`
`{n}After the autopsy, ......it will probably be immediately cremated.`
`Then, I'll never be able to see her face, ...even her dead face, for all eternity...`
`"..................`
` .........Haha, ...because of the shock of losing Shannon,`
` ......am I going a little crazy...?"`
`I don't want......Shannon's body to be burned.`
`{n}If she's burned, she'll turn to ash, ......and {i:never again will it be possible for her to revive}.`
`They say that cremation is disliked in Western tradition.`
`{n}......Because on the day of resurrection, there would be no body to revive.`
`Because of that, it seems that great criminals in Western history were often cremated after execution as a punishment,`
` and their ashes were sometimes scattered in rivers and such...`
`In other words, to Western people, death is nothing more than a sleep until the resurrection.`
` It is essential that the corpse is left after death.`
`"In other words,`
` ......that's because Western people...`
`...knew of the existence of...`
`...a miracle to revive the dead.`
` .........But that miracle didn't exist in Japan, so we burn them."`
`Now I understand.`
` ...I understand why Grandfather idolized the Western occult.`
`From the beginning, it had all been only for that reason.`
` ...Just to revive the person dear to him, ...Grandfather spent the rest of his remaining life researching the Western occult.`
`.........The situation surrounding us right now was abnormal.`
`Grandfather had revived his beloved {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`...And that {f:5:Beatrice} had carried out a terrible serial murder,`
` with chains of locked rooms that were impossible without the use of magic.`
`......The Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}The incarnation of the miracle of the Western occult.`
`{n}.........And also, the culprit who killed Shannon......`
`I should hate that being, ............and yet, for some reason, I want to cling to the hope she represents.`
`I wonder if she could use that miraculous magic that Grandfather spent his life espousing...to revive Shannon...`
`According to the Ushiromiya family legend, Grandfather met with her long ago, and was given a vast quantity of gold.`
`...Then if I also met her,`
` ......instead of gold, would she give me Shannon's life?`
`In return, she could impose any kind of devil's contract.`
`{n}For that, I would sacrifice all of my remaining life...`
`George probably couldn't have believed or noticed that, ...right behind him,`
` ......the witch herself stood, listening to his voiceless wish.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} had been listening to everything George and the others had to say since their discussion just now in the cousins' room.`
`......Battler had told her that she didn't know the weight of a human's life,`
` ......and wanting to understand that in her own way, she had stealthily visited, and listened to their discussion.`
`"........................`
` ......You say that is your wish...?`
` If I could grant that, would I be accepted as a witch...?"`
`Beato looked at the palms of both of her hands.`
`...She had handed over most of her previously surging magic power when the new witch had succeeded the name of Endless Witch.`
`Of course, even now her magic power still made her worthy of being called a witch,`
` ...but it did not even compare to her previous strength.`
`"......Hmph.`
` Even without the Endless Magic, I am a Great Witch whose name has thundered through a thousand years.`
` Reviving the dead is no trouble at all."`
`Inside her head, she thought about several magical methods for reviving the dead.`
`......Even magic that she could do easily in the past would be difficult with her current magic power.`
`She thought of something, then clicked her tongue, and repeated this several times.`
`In the end, ......she finally thought of a single spell.`
`But that was a spell that she couldn't use by herself.`
`{n}It was a spell that witches with weak power used, that relied on the aid of others.`
`...In the past, Beato had looked down upon that type of magic.`
`Therefore, she frantically tried to think if there wasn't any other possible spell,`
` .........but in the end, she couldn't think of one, and slumped over in self‐derision.`
`And then, ......careful not to surprise him, she softly called out.`
` Softly, to George's heart...`
`".........Ushiromiya George.`
` ...Can you hear my voice...?"`
`"......I can hear.`
` ......Who are you...?`
` Are you really the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}...?`
` ...Or else, are you an illusion created by my sadness...?"`
`".........If it's the former, I want you to hear my wish.`
` ...And if it's the latter, just leave me alone..."`
`Conversations in the world of the mind are a lot like those in a dream.`
`When you dream, haven't you ever had the experience...`
`of casually accepting something that would have been absurd in the real world?`
`......The conversation in this world was like that.`
`So even though a witch appeared and started talking to George, he was not surprised...`
`"Mm.`
` ......I am...the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` .........Normally, you and I would not be able to talk together like this.`
` ...However, you are strongly conscious of me, and wish to have a discussion,`
` ...so both of our channels are able to match like this."`
`"...............The person who killed Shannon...`
`I don't care if it was you, or someone else taking on your name.`
` ......As long as you exist as a real witch."`
`"............I would pay any compensation.`
` ...If you desire my life, you can take it right now.`
` ......Please, I want you to bring Shannon back to life...`
` .........If that's impossible, then at least, I would like just to be allowed to talk to her for a short while......`
` ......Please........."`
`".........I require no compensation.`
` I shall grant that wish."`
`"...Really......?`
` You'll really bring Shannon........."`
`"Mm.`
` ......However, my current magic power is not sufficient to use resurrection magic.`
` ...Therefore, I must rely on your help."`
`".........If there's something I can do, I'll do anything.`
` ...Even if that means taking my heart out right here and now, I will not hesitate..."`
`"...I'm telling you that I don't require something like that.`
` ............I may cast the spell.`
` Then, a gap would open in the door to Hades."`
`"...But as I am now, I do not have the power to bring Shannon's soul up through that gap.`
` .........However, if it were you, who has strong feelings for Shannon,`
` you should be able to change those feelings into magic, and bring her soul out without fail."`
`"......What do you say?`
` Will you help me...?"`
`"...Of course I will.`
` .........If Shannon's life will be revived,`
` ......I am not afraid to lose everything......!"`
`George's fists shook in silence.`
`...Then he slowly regained consciousness.`
`He had been absentmindedly standing near the window in the hall the whole time, his mug still in his hand...`
`And......`
`............the witch from his dream......was still there.`
`"Wh‐......what the... .........I‐it isn't......a dream........."`
`"......Be quiet.`
` I am very fragile now.`
` If any more {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s appear now, I will not be able to preserve this form.`
` ...I shall grant your wish, so stay silent for now.`
` ...Is that alright?"`
`George covered his mouth with both hands, forcefully nodding several times.`
`As he did, he almost dropped the mug he was holding.`
`George frantically juggled it around and caught it.`
`...He was afraid that if it fell to the floor and made a loud sound,`
` the witch's form might disappear like a bubble popping.`
`He softly set the mug on the floor, ...and stared once again at the witch in front of him.`
`.........Her form didn't disappear.`
` It wasn't a dream......`
`"Come, let us go to the parlor where Shannon sleeps.`
` With the power of your feelings, we will bring back her soul."`
`"Y‐you say go, but...how...?`
` My mother and the others are downstairs.`
` There's no way they'd let me go outside.`
` ......And, didn't you just say that you wouldn't be able to preserve your form if another {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} appeared?"`
`"......Come to think of it, that is true.`
` So, Krauss and the rest are downstairs.`
` ...In that case, we definitely cannot go down.`
` ......Well then, we just need to go to the mansion without going downstairs, right?`
` It's simple."`
`Beato laughed, as though she had thought of a pleasant prank.`
`......And with her golden pipe, she lightly tapped a window with its shutter closed.`
`When she did, three gold butterflies appeared from the pipe and opened the lock on the window as though melting it.`
`Then the window opened without a sound.`
`The shutter beyond it was exactly the same.`
`{n}The clasp unset itself, also without making a sound, and it quietly opened.`
`The window opened, exposing the wind and rain outside the mansion.`
` ...Perhaps because of the direction or something related to the construction of the building, the wind did not blow inside.`
`Because of that, for a while,`
` George felt as though this entrance opening to the outside was a dream or illusion, and he couldn't accept it as real.`
`"Come, let us go.`
` Come with me."`
`Beato gently floated upwards.`
` It was a natural action, like that of a diver enjoying an underwater stroll.`
`......It made it easy to believe that if you acted like she did,`
` you too might be able to float in the sky just as though you were swimming in the water.`
`...No, George did believe that.`
`......So without thinking, just as she had done, he also...`
`...gently...`
`...as though swimming in the water...he moved his feet......`
`"......ah, ............aaaaaaahh........."`
`"Hoh.`
` ...Not bad.`
` So you learned how to dance through the sky faster than I could explain it."`
`George was shocked to find himself floating in midair like he was swimming.`
`...Of course, Beato was also shocked that George, who should have been unacquainted with magic, had learned how to do that just by instinct.`
`".........To be able to...`
`...fly in the air,`
` ......swim in the air......"`
`"...You must not think of the logic.`
` Accept it as a natural thing.`
` ......You must not think back upon the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} doctrines, such as those from Newton and Einstein."`
`"Especially when flying high in the sky.`
` ...Inexperienced witches sometimes fall."`
`"...I, ...I accept it as true...`
` I accept it as true......"`
`George repeated those words over and over.`
`{n}......He must not deny magic, no matter what.`
`To deny that would be the same as to throw away what might be...`
`his first and last chance to revive Shannon.`
`However, compared to Beato, who was elegantly drifting like smoke, George's movements were clearly similar to someone underwater.`
`...Therefore, if he didn't make a movement like kicking his feet in water every once in a while, he would be slowly dragged down by the force of gravity.`
`"I shall praise this as being a better performance than the first time I danced in the sky.`
` ......Here we go.`
` Come with me."`
`Beato beckoned to George, and gently flew into the stormy sky.`
`......It was just like a scene from a fairy tale.`
`The scene unfolding before George's eyes felt entirely like an extension of his dream.`
`"......Being able to fly is......incredible, ......but so is the wind and the rain..."`
`"What's this? Are the wind and rain tormenting you...?`
` ......I could teach you magic to block against that,`
` but it may be too early for you, and it may be a misuse of time right now."`
`"........................Yes.`
` ...The magic I need...isn't that."`
`Without losing to the wind and rain, George wore a strong‐willed gaze.`
`"The mansion is coming into sight.`
` ...Hold out just a little longer.`
` If you fall now, you'll hit the bushes in the rose garden."`
`The undulating rose garden was spread beneath the witch and George's gazes.`
`This fantasy‐like scene no longer surprised George.`
`Only the gradually approaching mansion was reflected in his eyes.`
`"Shannon, .........wait for me...`
` ......I will definitely...revive you......!"`
`Meanwhile...`
`......the cruel new witch could be seen staring at the guesthouse from a different location.`
`"...............Now, all that's left is the seventh and eighth twilights.`
` Just two more, and my obligation to that predecessor hag is finished.`
` .........I'll kill Krauss and Natsuhi.`
` Together like a happy couple."`
`"Nihi.`
` How are the targets nyeh?"`
`"......In the lobby on the first floor of the guesthouse, both targets and Ushiromiya Eva acquired.`
` Measuring anti‐magic power.`
` Data link to 410."`
`"410, data received.`
` Anti‐magic power is extremely low.`
` If Eva just goes outside, they're tuna and abalone on a chopping board.`
` Nihihihihi...!"`
`"What would you ask of us, Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` If you give the order, we will snipe right away...!`
` Please, your orders...!"`
`"...You guys reaally are convenient furniture.`
` Very different from old, second‐hand furniture, which only has enough talent to gouge corpses.`
` Right?"`
`"..............................kh..."`
`"Chiester Sisters, please show me your skill again.`
` ...Prepare to attack!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!`
` Carry the corpses out again, alright?`
` 'Cause I'll play with them a lot.`
` No complaints, OK, Ronove?"`
`"......Yes.`
` Certainly."`
`"Nn......"`
`At that time, the witch noticed something.`
` ......As though some presence had disappeared...`
` ...Was it her imagination......?`
`".........Did you feel some kind of presence just now?`
` Did any of you feel it?"`
`"M‐...my apologies, I didn't notice anything... Please forgive me......!!"`
`"We were in the middle of observing the guesthouse, so our peripheral surveillance was turned off. Nihi.`
` ...What about you, Lucifer‐chaaan?`
` Did you feel a presence?"`
`".........nh—"`
`For just an instant, Lucifer sent a glance at Ronove, questioning whether she should answer honestly or not.`
`Ronove gave a small nod in response.`
`"No.`
` ...My apologies, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` Nothing from us.`
` .........Forgive us for this stupidity, as we are only second‐hand furniture."`
`"..........................."`
`"..........................."`
`"...........................`
` ......I see.`
` If a Great Demon like you says that, then it must have been my imagination."`
`The witch stared persistently in the direction the presence had disappeared to.`
`......That was the direction of the rose garden.`
` And beyond that, she could see the mansion's dark silhouette created by lightning.`
`......It took her quite some time before she pushed her unsatisfied feelings aside,`
` and once again turned to face the guesthouse.`
`The guesthouse lobby had been engulfed by silence.`
`The strings of tension which bound Krauss, Natsuhi, and Eva had already loosened; they were completely tired; and their consciousness was beginning to waver.`
`Every once in a while, they would stand up and walk around pointlessly, fighting their drowsiness.`
`".........Are you alright, Eva‐san?`
` ...Please, do take it easy and rest."`
`"I told you, I'm fine......`
` ...The three of us are now the only adults...`
` There's no time to rest...`
` I'll guard this place even if I have to go through hell and high water......`
` ......haah......haah......"`
`She spoke a brave line, but she couldn't hide her rough breathing.`
`{n}...It seemed that the fever, which had been calmed with medicine for a time, had returned.`
`It was very obvious that Eva's condition was not good.`
`"Don't push yourself.`
` At least close your eyes.`
` If we have to wake you, we definitely will."`
`"I'm telling you that I'm fine...!`
` Leave me alone......!!"`
`".............................."`
`It seemed that she had now become stubborn.`
` ......Krauss and Natsuhi realized that no matter what else they said to her, in her current state, it wouldn't reach her ears.`
`So they decided to say nothing more, and to let her be.`
`To Eva right now, even an argument like that was putting a burden on her.`
`{n}It would probably be better for her if she just sat there with her mouth closed.`
`As a matter of fact, Eva was already on the point of succumbing to her drowsiness.`
` ...She might have talked back with a temper because she was trying to encourage herself and throw off her sleepiness.`
`The clock would very soon be pointing to six in the afternoon.`
`Because she had been snacking over and over again to fool her drowsiness, she didn't feel hungry,`
` but instead, her lack of sleep made it feel like it was six in the morning rather than the afternoon.`
`......Even supposing that the boat would come at precisely nine in the morning tomorrow,`
` ......there were still more than twelve full hours to go.`
`...That was a dizzyingly long stretch of time.`
`............Long.`
` .........Painful......`
` ......Hot...`
`Even the sound of the clock torments my body now.`
`In times like this, ......he would put his hand on my forehead, and the fever would always fade at once.`
`...But he isn't here anymore.........`
`As Eva's mind grew foggy, she was once again gripped by a deep sadness...`
`She had already cried herself dry.`
`{n}Even so, the sadness from losing her beloved husband had not been exhausted...`
`"...............I...`
`...was wrong..."`
`"...Why?"`
`Originally, the new witch had been the same being as Eva.`
`{n}...If Eva talked to her, she would always respond...`
`"......If I could only gain the position of family head, ...that was always enough.`
` ......But as soon as I saw that mountain of gold, my greed grew.`
` ............I was struck with a desire to have that mountain of gold all to myself......"`
`"That's nothing to be embarrassed about.`
` After all, it's your natural right as the Ushiromiya family head.`
` How could you give up even a bit of it to anyone else?"`
`"............I was gripped by that temptation, ...which is why you were born.`
` ......While you are the heart of my young self,`
` ......at the same time, you are also my self‐centered evil heart."`
`"......It's my foolish greed, which sprouted thanks to that mountain of gold,`
` ......that allowed you to break out of the shell of my heart, ...and be born into this world...`
` .........I'm to blame for giving birth to you......!"`
`"In that case, when I killed Rosa and Maria,`
` and then Rudolf, Kyrie and Hideyoshi, you were to blame for that too."`
`"Why did you kill my husband too...?!`
` Why......?!!`
` Uuuuuhghuuhuhhuu!!"`
`"...I didn't want to kill Hideyoshi.`
` He was just so annoying and persistent.`
` ...And that's our, no, your fault.`
` It's your fault for choosing a husband like that."`
`"A child like you can't possibly understand how good he was!!`
` Uuuughh{0}hhu{0}uuhu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}uughh...{0}honey.........uuu{0}u{0}u{0}uuhhuhghh{0}hhu{0}uhuu{0}huu!"`
`".........Come on.`
` Our dreams were made real with magic, right?`
` We solved the riddle of the epitaph.`
` And we found the gold and got the Head's Ring.`
` All of our dreams came fully true, right?`
` What more could you want...?"`
`"Those weren't the only dreams I had...!!`
` Living a wonderful life with that man, and entrusting George with an excellent life...!`
` I still have so many dreams that I need to fulfil, ...as a wife, as a mother...!!`
` And yet, ......and yet......!"`
`"...Those are just extra dreams {i:you} gained after becoming an adult.`
` They aren't {i:our} dreams."`
`"And that is why you're a child...!!`
` It only matters that {i:you} get what {i:you} want?!`
` ......That's right, all of this is my fault...!!`
` Back then, why did I resist doing what Rosa told me to?`
` Why couldn't I announce to all of the siblings that I had found the gold...?"`
`"......It's all because of the ugliness in my heart!!`
` My evil heart, which sprouted out of a desire to have all of the gold all to myself, ......caused you to hatch!!"`
`".........I don't see why I deserve that much hate.`
` Even though the both of us together make up Ushiromiya Eva."`
`"No, that isn't true anymore.`
` And it was you who said it.`
` I am Ushiromiya Eva.`
` And you are the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}...!!"`
`"So just disappear already!`
` Witches are a delusion, a fantasy that can only exist in fairy tales...!!`
` Just DISAPPEAR!`
` Don't ever show yourself to me again!!"`
`"...Oh, ......so that's how it is.`
` ...Alright.`
` I'll disappear from your sight."`
`"...And I am no longer Ushiromiya Eva.`
` From now on, I'm the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...So now I will play however I want."`
`"I'm done caring about you.`
` Why don't you just give up and die forever?!"`
`After having a fittingly childlike tantrum, the witch who had once been another Eva vanished.`
`......Only Eva was left behind in the darkness.`
`{n}And she questioned herself...`
`"Was it me......?`
` {i:I}......killed them......?`
` Did I kill...that person......?`
` ......Did {i:I}......kill...him............?"`
`Now, that question was one she herself would never answer......`
`"...g... *cough*cough*cough*!!`
` *cough*cough*cough*!!"`
`It seemed that, half‐asleep, she had gotten some saliva caught in her windpipe just as she was dozing off.`
` ...Eva suddenly started coughing.`
`"Are you alright, Eva?`
` ...Natsuhi, some water, please."`
`"Y‐yes..."`
`"I, ......I'm alright, okay...`
` *cough*cough*cough*!`
` *cooough*cough*!!`
` I just...choked a bit, that's all......!`
` *cough*cough*cough*!"`
`Eva pushed away Natsuhi's hand as she tried to rub her back, and unsteadily rose to her feet.`
`".........I'm going to wash my face.`
` ...Sorry, I fell asleep.`
` ......When I get back, I'll make some more coffee.`
` .........Extra strong, so that we won't get drowsy until tomorrow morning."`
`"Mm, please do.`
` ......Your coffee fits my tastes more than the one Gohda makes."`
`"I'm pleased to hear that, even if you're just flattering me...`
` *cough*cough*!`
` .........I'll be back soon."`
`Eva exited the lobby, heading for the lavatory.`
`{n}Krauss and Natsuhi watched over her frail back...`
`"......So you do sometimes care for Eva‐san, even though you have always been so much at odds with her."`
`"........................`
` ...Properly speaking, isn't this what an older brother should do...?"`
`"......Yes.`
` I believe it is."`
`"Not just Eva.`
` ......Rudolf, and Rosa too.`
` ...The only ways in which I have acted like an older brother to them are to speak arrogantly and bully them."`
`".........In my own way, I was frantic in my desire to be like my father.`
` ...But I could never match up, and I always vented my feelings on them...`
` However, that is no excuse."`
`"...I probably scarred Eva so deep that it still has not healed.`
` ......I regret it, but even if I apologized after all this time, that would not heal those wounds..."`
`".........If you hold on to that emotion, and continue to hold onto it,`
` ...I'm sure that feeling will come through to your siblings."`
`"......At this point, my only sibling left is Eva."`
`"...............If only...the family you and your siblings were born into had not been the Ushiromiya family......`
`......you might have had a more normal, a more fun sibling relationship..."`
`"...You mustn't say that...`
` .........Eva will probably continue to hate me for her whole life.`
` And she has the right to.`
` ...I intend to resign myself to that and accept it."`
`".....................Dear......"`
`"......Eva,`
` .........I am sorry.`
` ......Of course, you don't have to forgive me..."`
`Of course I won't. Bit late, don't you think?`
`"If you know you're in the wrong, why don't you just give up and die right now and forever?!`
` Do it, Chiester Sisters!!"`
`"45, firing permission received.`
` Reconfirming firing curve, correcting for weather.`
` Data link to 410."`
`"410, data received, firing permission confirmed.`
` Nihihihihi, firing!"`
`Together, the sisters released the readied magic bowstring.`
` A beautiful tail trailed the golden arrow, and it drew a beautiful curve as it flew.`
`It was just like a golden snake.`
`It skillfully avoided a grove of trees and flew towards the front door of the guesthouse.`
`Then it flew into the keyhole of the door and snuck into the guesthouse without any problem at all.`
`The gold snake raced down the hall smoothly, yet as fast as an arrow.`
`Right in front of it was the door to the lobby.`
`It would only need to fly into that keyhole, and Krauss and Natsuhi would be right there...`
`For an instant, Krauss thought he saw the door's keyhole sparkle gold.`
`However, at the same time he strained his eyes to see what it was, that sparkle bent like a whip and attacked,`
` wrapping itself around Krauss's neck.`
`"...............ack.........ahkh—khk—"`
`Just looking at it, the gold snake looked very supple.`
` However, it was as though a wire had tightened around Krauss's neck.`
`And while that snake choked Krauss, it extended even more, and also tightened around Natsuhi's neck.`
`Without even the chance to scream, their eyes bulged as they went into convulsions and then collapsed.`
`"45, hit and kill confirmed.`
` Forming towing curve, correcting adjustment points.`
` Data link to 410."`
`"410, data received.`
` Initiating corpse towing.`
` Two on the line at once nyeh, nihi!"`
`The gold snake began to drag Krauss and Natsuhi's corpses back.`
`......It slipped through the door to the corridor, dragging the corpses, gradually increasing in speed,`
` and in the blink of an eye, it had pulled them outside the guesthouse.`
`So the lobby was still, as though nothing had happened at all.`
`...As though Krauss and Natsuhi had never been there to begin with.`
`Only the sound of the wind and the rain remained, as though feigning ignorance and pretending that they had been the only ones there......`
`"......Sorry, I'm fine now.`
` ...Now, I'll go make some coffee."`
`Eva returned from the lavatory.`
`{n}But no one was in the lobby.`
`Even though they had been in that sofa until the very moment she had choked and gone to the lavatory,`
` they had now gone, as if they had been an illusion from the beginning.`
`"...How careless...`
` ......Where did those two go off together?"`
`Like she was pretending to be in a detective novel, Eva put her hand on the sofa.`
`......She felt a warmth indicating that they had been sitting there until a short while ago.`
`Maybe they had gone to do the rounds or something.`
`For the time being, Eva sat down and waited for their return...`
`Beato and George could be seen in the parlor of the mansion.`
`{n}George was kneeling near Shannon's body as though praying...`
`{n}His face was sincerity itself, and there was even sweat on his forehead.`
`However, Beato was the same.`
` Now that she had handed her name over, most of her previous power had been lost.`
`...Of course, she still had more than enough power to be called a witch, but compared to the past, it was a very faint thing.`
`"......Good.`
` Don't talk to her, don't touch her with your hand.`
` ...Call to her with the voice of your heart; seek her with the hand of your heart.`
` ...Only your strong feelings can make my magic reach Shannon's lost soul."`
`".................................hh."`
`George maintained a single‐minded focus.`
`{n}He kept frantically yelling inside his heart, trying to call back the soul of the person he loved.`
`...He strongly envisioned his soul leaving his body, and searching for her as she wandered through Hell.`
`......Beato turned that strong force into magical power, supplementing her own magic.`
` It was magic that, in the past, she could have performed easily, without anyone's help.`
`...But now, if she didn't rely on someone's help, she wouldn't be able to finish the chant, much less succeed.`
`".........I have forgotten after several hundred years...`
` .........Was magic,`
` ......was resurrection...`
`always this difficult of a magic......?"`
`An even more strained expression than George's had risen to Beato's face.`
`...She was still forgetting this, but the magic to revive a life is fundamentally the ultimate hidden art.`
`It was her previous magical power, giving her the ability to use that magic over and over with a snap of her fingers, that was abnormal.`
`Therefore, the heavy burden to her body and mind was, by rights, absolutely to be expected...`
`"......However, .........the power this one has...`
`is quite considerable, even though he doesn't know magic.`
` ......I see, so he truly is Kinzo's grandchild..."`
`The strong power pouring from George was even large enough to pass as magical power.`
`...At first, Beato thought it was due to the blood of the mage Kinzo.`
`......However, that was probably wrong.`
`{n}...She had a feeling that Battler had taught her that.`
`George's power to feel sorrow for the death of his loved one......arose from the way he had tried his hardest throughout his life,`
` from the warm time spent together with Shannon, and from the size of their shared dream, promising each other their futures.`
`Do humans really live this seriously during their one single life?`
`......Of course they do.`
` To her, a life didn't mean anything more than the difference between the top and bottom of an Othello piece.`
`If the black represented death, then she thought all you had to do was flip it over again and make it white.`
`However, it was just like that broken vase.`
`......To humans in a world without magic, where they can never return it to its original form,`
` ......it is very, very natural for them to bet all their body and soul on that single life.`
`".........So there are times when an Endless Witch, with full command over even life and death,`
` ......is inferior to a finite {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, for whom even death's mountain is impossible to cross......?"`
`Now, the witch acknowledged it.`
`He was able to hold a magical power that could not reside in witches who didn't understand the value of a life.`
`......What is this thing called the Endless Magic {i:for} again?`
`...Even though I call myself the Endless Witch,`
` have I been forgetting what the Endless Magic means...for a whole thousand years.........?`
`She looked at George's expression again.`
` .........His surging earnestness was like a lightning bolt.`
`...Right now, even if George's body was burned, or smashed by a waterfall,`
` he would probably continue to pray for his beloved without minding it, without noticing it.`
`For the first time, ...she showed respect for that power.`
`So in that instant, all magical resistance was lost, and the enormous power of George's feelings turned into magical power in its perfect form......`
`The vase was very, very beautiful, rich with history and value.`
`Even as young as I was, it still forced me to take a deep breath when I witnessed its beauty.`
` ......But that just made me want to touch it.`
`But the vase easily fell and smashed into smithereens.`
`...Like a popped bubble,`
` it felt as though the time when it had possessed a form was just an illusion.`
`It was that fragile, ......that easily lost, that life.`
`I realized that, because of my own foolish curiosity, I had done something that couldn't be taken back.`
`No matter how much I regretted it, no matter how much I apologized.`
`{n}The broken vase would not return to its original form...`
`{n}A lost life will not return to normal no matter what happens.`
`I was frightened by the fact that my own frivolous action, even though it had been frivolous,`
` ...had stolen a life that could never be revived again.`
`And, out of pity for the lost life, I cried.`
`{n}Out of fear of myself, who had made it become lost, I cried even more.`
`I was sure that Grandfather would also cry at the loss of his precious vase.`
`I was sure that all of the people who thought fondly of Grandfather would cry too, when they saw him like that.`
`By just the loss of a single life, the whole world would be filled with so much sadness.`
`......I cried even more at how terrible that would be.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} appeared, and spoke.`
`"Then, Milady.`
` Let us revive this vase with magic.`
` If that will make everyone happy, then the vase and the magic and the spirits...`
`should be happy to lend you their power, and return it to its original form."`
`"Come, Milady.`
` Close your eyes, and say the chant with me..."`
`"Come, try closing your eyes.`
` And try to remember.`
` What form did you have?`
` It was surely a very, very beautiful form.`
` Please, show me that form one more time..."`
`Those words of power powerfully knocked on the door to Hades.`
`Her previous magic had powerfully knocked on the door to Hades in the same way.`
`......However, back then, it was horribly violent, ...and earned the displeasure of the peacefully sleeping dead...`
`However, this time was different.`
` ...It was very powerful, ...but it was very kind and loving.`
`The dead near the door opened their eyes,`
` ......and called out to the other dead that there was a voice calling for someone to come back.`
`...The sadness of that voice calling from the outside touched the hearts of the dead,`
` and trying to respond as quickly as possible, they searched for Shannon's lost soul...`
`And then,`
` .........they found it.`
`{n}They found the casket in which Shannon was peacefully sleeping.`
`It truly was Shannon's soul, sleeping in the land of the dead.`
`{n}......Inside a casket that was covered with rose petals frozen with frost, she was sleeping in peace...`
`The dead silently lifted that casket up.`
`...While it looked like a funeral march at a glance, it had the complete opposite meaning.`
`It was solemn, but filled with joy.`
`...It reminded the long‐forgotten dead...`
`that they continue to be loved even after their deaths,`
` ......and gave them all a warm sense of peace......`
`Then, ...as though guided by a warm light from the heavens, ...Shannon's body floated up out of the casket...`
`The dead watched her go.`
` ......They squinted at that warm light,`
` giving their respect to this unknown member of the living, who had continued to hold onto his love for a person even after her death...`
`Shannon's body was sucked into the light in the heavens, and began to disappear...`
`In the jet‐black darkness of the land of the dead, the faint flickering of gold butterflies could be seen.`
`...It reminded them of the gentle stars in the night sky, which they had long forgotten...`
`"........................hh!"`
`George remembered being told that he must not say anything, and he hurriedly covered his mouth.`
`However, it felt like his heart was trying to jump out of his throat.`
`{n}......Because he had seen Shannon's eyelids shake slightly.`
`And then, ...those eyelids slowly opened.`
` Shannon's eyes were there, but they were still covered in the frost of the land of the dead.`
`However, ......the warmth of the human world...no.`
` ......The warmth of her loved one, who had called her soul back, slowly dissolved that frost,`
` .........and her eyes gradually regained their sparkle.`
`Then, .........her eyes moved, ...and recognized George.`
`"......George......san..............."`
`As her lips shook weakly,`
` ......Shannon definitely said that.`
`The words were very faint.`
`{n}So much so that they normally wouldn't even have reached his ears.`
`......However, George clearly heard them.`
`.........He heard his loved one, his fiancée, the one he loved most who should have been dead,`
` call his name once again...`
`"Shannon,`
` .........Shannon.........`
`can you...`
`...recognize me.........?"`
`"...George‐sa...n......`
` .........Is this...a dream.........?"`
`"No.`
` This isn't a dream.`
` ......See, look, ......even if I pinch, you don't wake up."`
`As George said that, he softly pinched Shannon's cheek.`
`......It was how George had always responded in the past, when Shannon had been surprised by something and had asked if she was dreaming.`
`When Shannon felt the warm touch of George's finger on her cheek...`
`{n}......And when George realized that the warmth of a living person had already returned to the cheek of his beloved...`
`......They both cried.`
`...With what words should a pair of lovers separated by death celebrate their reunion?`
` ......The words of the human world are not enough to celebrate that.`
`In short, they had no need of the words of this world...`
`Shannon sat up, and the two of them simply wordlessly hugged each other.`
`Shannon still didn't have much strength in her, and putting her arms around George's back took all she had,`
` ......so George hugged her tightly to make up for that.`
`To stop her from ever again going to a place beyond his reach,`
` he hugged her so tightly, and yet so gently......`
`Shannon's fingers curled around George's back,`
` ......and on her ring finger indeed shone the engagement ring George had given her.`
`That strong sparkle was absolutely not the sparkle of diamond alone.`
`{n}......There was, without doubt, a magical power there that only the two lovers could possibly feel.`
`It was because that strong light existed...that they had been able to find her casket in the land of the dead.`
`Beato understood.`
`......That ring, ......no.`
`............The couple's feelings, in the form of that ring, had created this miracle.`
`In that moment, George had definitely used magic.`
` Beato had done nothing more than help him along.`
` That magic had a magical power that could only reside in those who knew of the importance of life and trying their hardest.`
`It was the power of a miracle that an Endless Witch could not know, ......that only the power of the {i:finite} could give rise to.`
`By now, she had no choice but to accept it.`
` ......She had to accept that true magic, true magical power...`
`...existed in the place farthest away from she who called herself a Great Witch.`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice}...sama......"`
`"......She brought you back to life...`
` Thank you, {f:5:Beatrice}...!"`
`"No.`
` I could not do anything.`
` ......What revived Shannon...was your magical power.`
` Your magic.`
` ............I have indeed witnessed here the Ushiromiya blood, capable of achieving miracles."`
`".........George‐san was the one who......brought......?"`
`"...Mm.`
` .........He had a phenomenal magical power, so much so that I could not reach up to his feet.`
` ......So I still have not left the level of apprentice, then.`
` ...Now I finally know my place."`
`Beato staggered backwards.`
`{n}...Her physical strength was clearly exhausted.`
`She had humbly said that George's power alone had revived Shannon, but Beato had also used all of her magical and physical strength.`
`...And she reflected upon how difficult it was to revive a single one of these lives,`
` which she had toyed with however she wanted in the past.`
`The couple kept each other in their tight embrace, and showed no signs of letting go.`
` ...Feelings that couldn't be communicated with a billion words were thus communicated between them...`
`"Thank you, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...We are in your debt..."`
`"...Thank you very much, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` ......I will never forget that it was you who let me meet with George again."`
`"......Enough, enough.`
` Being thanked by a pair of lovers is far too embarrassing for one who has been feared as an extreme savage.`
` ......Don't worry...about me.`
` ...Take all the time you want.........celebrating your reunion together........."`
`Beato, who was leaning her back against the wall, slid down the wall, and sat.`
` How many centuries had it been since she had last grown this tired from using magic?`
`......Probably, not since the time I first succeeded in magic.`
`.........Didn't Master praise me for that back then?`
`Oh, but, I myself killed that master who praises me, didn't I...`
`......Don't be naive, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`...In the end, that's what it means to kill something, right...?`
`"......Finally,`
` ...it seems you've remembered how to use magic."`
`"...............My whole head...feels parched and suffocated, ......and I can't even think, let alone remember...`
` ...Wait, ...didn't I kill you?`
` You shouldn't be appearing..."`
`"You have let me live until now.`
` That is why I can appear like this.`
` ......However, I did not come here to pat you on the head."`
`"......Did you come here just to sneer at how pathetic I am?`
` ......And after all this time, after retiring as a witch and everything, ...if I sit here and have my head patted, I'll be the laughingstock of the other witches......"`
`"That's right.`
` ......Not only are you a full adult, but you boast about having retired from active service,`
` so I am sure that it would be far too embarrassing to tell anyone that you only just now learned how to use magic."`
`"............Yeah.`
` ......Keep it a secret, Masteer..."`
`With a sense of pleasant despondency, Beato gazed at the couple hugging each other.`
`"Love, huh.`
` ...............I'm no match..."`
`"45, data received.`
` Firing preparations complete.`
` Ammo selected, now loading."`
`"410, firing.`
` Nihi!"`
`The golden serpentine arrow fired by the Chiesters...`
`weaved its way through the bushes in the rose garden,`
` weaved its way through the hedges,`
` and climbed the stone steps towards the mansion's entrance,`
` aiming for the keyhole.`
`It weaved through the corridors,`
` and flew into the keyhole in the door to the parlor...!`
`"......Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh?!?!"`
`It happened in an instant.`
` ...It would have been difficult for Beato, who was completely worn out, to have noticed it beforehand.`
`Right before Beato's eyes, the gold snake that flew in through the keyhole...`
`spun circles around the two lovers,`
` and pierced through their two hearts in a blink of an eye.`
`......And with meticulous precision, that gold snake ran through that hole in Shannon's chest once more...`
`The two had been pierced through the heart by the gold snake,`
` ...no, by the gold sewing thread used by the new brutal witch's furniture,`
` .........and it had only taken an instant, so unfitting for the amount of effort it had taken to revive Shannon...!`
`In front of Beato's shocked eyes, the two collapsed onto the floor...`
`".........G‐`
`......George......`
`.........Shannon..............."`
`"......Thank you,`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice}......`
` ...For letting us meet,`
` ...even just for a short while,`
` ......thank you........."`
`George spent his last breath thanking Beato, and died side by side with the one he loved.`
`The gold snake, which still sewed the two in place, spun like a large cyclone, revolving around the inside of the parlor.`
`.........It was searching for further kills in that room.`
`Then, the tip of the snake met Beato's gaze...`
`{n}In that instant, Beato prepared herself for death.`
`Just then, {f:5:Virgilia} stood in front of her, the fingers of both her hands drawing a mark.`
`In that instant, gold‐colored gold leaf buried the inside of the parlor.`
`{n}It was like a blizzard of gold...`
`"Beato, escape while you can!!`
` {i:No one can escape} from the Chiesters' golden bow!!!"`
`"410, target lost!!`
` Nihyah, magical chaff!!"`
`"45, understood...!`
` Modifying enemy search: personal image homing algorithm.`
` Target reacquired, data link to 410."`
`"410, data received.`
` Too slowww nyeh, Predecessor‐samaa!!`
` Here it comes here it comes here it comes,`
` ...IMPACT!!"`
`The Chiester Sisters' golden bow would not let its kill escape.`
`{n}It would not let them block it.`
`...No magical barrier could even dream of blocking it without being multilayered.`
`The weak point during the instant of confusion caused by {f:5:Virgilia}'s deception magic was Beato's only chance to escape.`
`And the only opportunity to make the sisters confuse {f:5:Virgilia} for Beato.`
`As {f:5:Virgilia} spread her arms wide, blocking the way to her beloved disciple, the gold snake pierced straight through the location of her heart...`
`The snake, which had snuck in through the keyhole, shot through George and Shannon, and then shot through {f:5:Virgilia} in an instant,`
` completely failed to notice as Beato escaped...`
`As soon as {f:5:Virgilia} saw that Beato had gotten away, she expired.`
`......The strength left her body, and like gold dust drifting with the wind, her form was erased...`
`Beato completely erased all traces of her magical power,`
` became gold butterflies, and passed through the wall, escaping to the wind and rain outside......`
`"..................Damn it,`
` .........damn it, damn it...`
` ......You bitch,`
` ......you biii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiitch...!!"`
`Beato felt sick from the bottom of her heart.`
`Why?`
` Because she had been attacked by the new witch?`
`Probably...not.`
` Of course, she also felt sick over the loss of her master.`
`But even more than that, Beato was enraged at the barbarism which had boorishly stolen the union between the two reunited lovers.`
`......Beato had poured out almost all of her magical power to reunite them.`
`...That miracle had been achieved only as a result of all that,`
` ......yet it had taken such a short time to steal it away...!`
`Beato trembled at the barbarous cruelty which had ended it so fast.`
`......And it was also the true form of the acts she herself had committed up until that point...`
`So just as strongly as Beato hated the new witch, she looked at her previous self with disgust.`
`But now she had to escape...`
`{n}......If she was targeted next, she would probably lose her life.`
`And it wouldn't even be funny if the chess player, descended like a god,`
` ended up being attacked and killed by the pieces.`
`"45, impact confirmed, target scattered.`
` ......W‐without a doubt, we crushed the Predecessor...!"`
`"Our pile of kill medals is gonna get bigger yeeeet again nyeh.`
` Nihi!"`
`"What was that about loving couples?`
` You get to enjoy them thrice—once tearing the two apart, once reuniting them, and once tearing them apart again...right?`
` *cackle*hihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hhihi!"`
`"And I feel great about getting to say goodbye to that fussy‐as‐fuck old hag at the same time.`
` ......Ronove, you don't have any complaints, right?"`
`"......Why, of course not,`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"She interfered with the ritual of the witch's epitaph, you see?`
` She revived a sacrifice from the first twilight without permission, and interfered with my ritual.`
` No one has aaany right at all to complain."`
`"Kuhhihihihhyahyahyahya...!`
` Sucks that she doesn't leave a corpse behind though.`
` ......I was thinking of torturing that old hag to death over and over again endlessly.`
` Kuhhi{0}hihya{0}hyahya...!!"`
`"........................"`
`"G‐George did...?!`
` He didn't show up, when did he come down?!"`
`"......Wh‐when...?`
` What time was that, again...?"`
`"I think...it was probably about four or five.`
` ...It was at least an hour ago..."`
`"We got sleepy, and probably dozed off after that...`
` But I think Jessica probably has it right.`
` About one or two hours ago."`
`"I, I also remember it being around that time.`
` Because I was asked whether I wanted more coffee..."`
`Something hard to believe had happened...`
`Apparently, when Auntie Eva had left for a second to visit the lavatory,`
` Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi had disappeared.`
`There's no way they went hiding somewhere.`
` Of course, the doors and windows had all been rigorously checked, and all were locked from the inside.`
` Not one of them was broken.`
`And that wasn't just the first floor—the second floor was the same.`
` Also, all of the doors and windows were designed in such a way that they couldn't be locked from the outside.`
`...In other words, there was no way that Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi had gone outside.`
`{n}......And yet, they couldn't be found.`
`Furthermore, they weren't the only ones who had disappeared......astonishingly, George‐aniki had too.`
`George‐aniki had left saying that he was going to get more coffee,`
` and had gone downstairs more than an hour earlier.`
`I'd been under the impression that he was having a good conversation with Auntie Eva and the rest,`
` ......but Auntie Eva, who had been in the lobby the whole time, said that no one had come down.`
`Since all of the doors and windows are locked from the inside,`
` ...it's hard to imagine that they went outside.`
`......Nevertheless, three humans had evaporated from this barricaded guesthouse, which had become a perfect locked room......`
`It's hard to imagine any reason why they'd hide themselves away for a surprise prank in a situation like this.`
`......It's probably appropriate to think that they've become caught up in this crime...`
`When Auntie Eva learned that her only son was missing,`
` she went half insane, running from room to room and yelling his name loudly.`
`...And Jessica, who had suddenly lost both of her parents, followed suit.`
`Cries of "George, George" and "Mom, Dad" were even now continuing to echo through the guesthouse...`
`I think George said something about wanting to see Shannon's face.`
`......It would be reasonable to imagine that he had snuck out of the guesthouse and gone to the mansion.`
`...However, I don't know about Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi.`
`{n}...Maybe they guessed that's what happened, and went to the mansion to search for him...?`
`Without even telling Auntie Eva...?`
`At this rate, it's only a matter of time before we start talking about leaving the guesthouse to search for them.`
`.........At this point, I'd be in favor of that.`
`We said that shutting ourselves up inside the guesthouse would be safe,`
` and shut ourselves in this morning as a big, happy family of twelve people.`
`And yet, now there are only four people here.`
` ......In other words, being here does not imply safety...`
`However, ...there's something even more important that we mustn't forget.`
`{n}That's the fact that all of the doors and windows were locked from the inside.`
`......This is a locked room.`
`{n}How had they vanished from this place?`
`We'd searched around thoroughly.`
`{n}However, we were unable to find any signs of anyone hiding.`
`...The three of them had almost certainly been taken outside the guesthouse.`
`".........I wonder how they did it...`
` You don't think......there might be something like a hidden door?"`
`"A hidden door...?"`
`"...The doors and the windows are impossible to lock from the outside by construction.`
` Even using a fishing line of some kind, it would probably be impossible with the way they are constructed.`
` In that case, it's probably reasonable to think that they left through somewhere other than a door or a window..."`
`".........You're right.`
` That does make logical sense.`
` ......No one can be sure that no hidden doors exist.`
` ...However, before leaping to that conclusion, I suspect a much simpler possibility."`
`"And...what would that be......?"`
`For some time, Battler had been opening windows, opening the shutters, and checking outside,`
` and repeating this for each window.`
`".........Hmm.`
` ...This window sure is quiet.`
` ...I see, unlike the other windows, the building's construction means that the wind doesn't blow into this one."`
`"It appears that way...`
` It feels strange that no wind or rain comes in, even though there is so much of it outside."`
`"Doctor Nanjo.`
` ...When I opened the window just now, did you hear a sound?"`
`"Huh?`
` ......No, I did not notice it...`
` I believe it is well oiled."`
`"In other words,`
` it would be possible to slink out through this hall window, which no one was watching.`
` Furthermore, the wind doesn't blow in through this window,`
` so the air pressure wouldn't cause the curtains or a door to make a sound.`
` ......It'd be quiet."`
`Battler leaned out and looked at the ground below.`
`{n}...He was searching for some sign that George had jumped down.`
`......But at a glance, he didn't see any mark like that on the grass in the middle of the pouring rain.`
`"......There might also be a window like this on the first floor.`
` It is possible to go outside without anyone noticing."`
`"However, not only the doors, but the windows too were all locked, and the shutters were even down as well, correct...?`
` It is possible to go out, but it would be impossible to lock up..."`
`"But they can be locked, see?`
` Just like this, click."`
`Battler closed the window and locked it, as though this was perfectly obvious.`
`"............B‐......Battler‐san, you aren't saying..............."`
`"If someone inside locked it in the end, this locked room is as easy as pie."`
`"B‐but that means,`
` .........that means,`
` ......ooooooohhhh......"`
`Nanjo turned pale and shook his head several times.`
` ...Because the thing that Battler said was presenting a certain truth to him that was frightening even to imagine...`
`"......That's {i:if} they used the trick I thought of, of course?`
` However, with this trick, only a very limited number of people can be suspected."`
`He didn't want to say it in front of Nanjo, ...but after eliminating Jessica, who had been with him the whole time,`
` ...the only ones who could have done it were Nanjo...and Eva.`
`"I, ...I would not do anything of the sort...!`
` Y‐yes, I can swear it...!!"`
`"......In this case, it would become a battle between Auntie Eva and you for an alibi.`
` ...We'd just have to suspect both of you,`
` and confine the two of you separately."`
`".........To say it the other way around, this might be an effective trick if there were more survivors,`
` but since our numbers have shrunk so much, it isn't particularly effective at all."`
`...No, in fact, there's a chance they could dig their own grave with it.`
`......It should have been more expedient to make it look like the culprit was outside,`
` and to intentionally leave a door unlocked, or break a window...`
`"............If this disappearing act had taken place midday today,`
` I'd have probably announced this theory with full confidence.`
` ...But at this stage, I'm not confident at all.`
` ............What's going on here?`
` ...What the hell does it {i:mean}?`
` .........This "locked room"......"`
`"Y‐......you don't think, umm........."`
`"Hmm?`
` What is it, Doctor Nanjo?`
` ...Even if it's just a thought, please say it."`
`Because Doctor Nanjo looked like he was trying to swallow his words despite having thought of something, I urged him on.`
`After he refused several times, saying that it was just a foolish idea, he finally said it out loud.`
`"......Well, umm,`
` ............you don't think this actually might be...`
`...the work of the witch...?"`
`"R‐...ridiculous.`
` There's no way witches exist."`
`"......The witch is trying to make her case to us.`
` ...She must be showing us that she can do things that humans cannot,`
` ...trying to make us accept her as a witch."`
`"...To me, this disappearance from the locked room of this entire guesthouse......feels like that kind of message from the witch......`
` ............I must not think of it.`
` Surely, it cannot mean anything.`
` ...Oooh, ......I, ...I am frightened......"`
`As Doctor Nanjo shook with fear, it looked like he was he was trying to erase the fearsome thoughts that he kept imagining, one after the other.`
`......When we went downstairs, Auntie Eva and Jessica were enraged,`
` and were each making a lot of noise about leaving this place and searching for their respective families.`
`It was a desire that naturally hits those who can no longer see their family.`
`Auntie Eva told Doctor Nanjo and me to stay here, but I shook my head and started walking.`
`".........I've had enough of being shut up in here.`
` ...I've started wanting to breathe some outside air."`
`"Yeah, and if we're going, let's go right now...!!`
` I'm sick as hell of staying shut up in this place...!!`
` Let's go and find Mom, Dad, and George nii‐san as fast as we can...!!"`
`The blood had all risen to Jessica's head.`
`{n}...I hope it doesn't set off her asthma.`
`"Anyone who wants to stay behind can do that themselves.`
` But we are going to search outside...!"`
`"What about you, Doctor Nanjo...?`
` Gonna watch the place by yourself...?"`
`"N‐no...`
` Please allow me to join you..."`
`If the alternative was holing up alone in a guesthouse whose security was by no means guaranteed,`
` it would be better to be in a danger zone as a group of four people.`
`Auntie Eva was holding the gun.`
` Moving separately from her was almost like asking to be made into the next victim.`
`In this way, the four of us decided to leave the guesthouse.`
`......We'd barricaded ourselves in, saying we'd be safe if we did, ......and then lost eight people.`
`It was almost as though this had been nothing more than a holding cell from which the sacrifices could be killed one after another.`
`We removed the chain, unlocked the front door, and opened it.`
`It was already pitch black out.`
` While there were some lights outside which dimly lit the pathway,`
` ......they didn't have enough power to illuminate the darkness that some suspicious person was likely to be hiding in.`
`"I'm going...!`
` If you fall behind, you're on your own, okay...?!"`
`Still holding her gun, Auntie Eva dashed out without an umbrella.`
`Jessica followed after her.`
`After looking at each other, Doctor Nanjo and I chased after them.`
`...What in the world is happening in this mansion, on this island?`
`Since yesterday, I've just been shut up in the cousins' room in the guesthouse with the rest of my cousins.`
` So I don't know anything about what's been going on outside.`
`Just what has been happening in those places I don't know about...`
`outside the room, in the mansion, and on this island?`
`......Everything is occurring, everything is proceeding,`
` ...and everything is ending without my knowing it.`
`Somewhere in my heart, I had already begun to give up.`
`...Most likely, ......not one of us will see tomorrow morning.`
`When the seagulls cry, none shall be left alive...`
`"Dad.........Mom......!!`
` Who would do something like this...?!!`
` Waaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaahhh...!!"`
`Jessica's woeful voice echoed throughout the rose garden...`
`Perhaps it was the intuition of a person who lived on this island.`
`...After Jessica had looked in the rose garden where Auntie Rosa and Maria had fallen and seen nothing,`
` she had gone to look in the arbor next.`
`Normally, the arbor was probably a wonderful location to enjoy tea peacefully while appreciating the roses on a good sunny day.`
`......Who knows, maybe even Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi...`
`had their days where they relaxed and enjoyed tea together there.`
`......In that arbor lay the bodies of Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi.`
`At least they weren't drenched in the rain like Auntie Rosa and Maria had been,`
` but there was no way I could say that out loud to Jessica at that moment...`
`"......What do you think, Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"Str‐...strangulation, I believe.`
` ...Take a look at this.`
` On their necks, there are distinct markings that something thin was used to strangle them."`
`"Right.`
` ......I doubt that these things were the primary cause of their deaths."`
`...The two stake‐like weapons decorated with an occult design that were lying on the ground...`
`had been found driven into Uncle Krauss's thigh area,`
` and near Aunt Natsuhi's calf.`
`When we had found these sticking out of my parents' forehead and chest,`
` we had decided to leave them exactly as they were for the police and to preserve the crime scene,`
` ......but Jessica no longer cared about such matters, and immediately pulled the stakes out of her parents' forsaken bodies.`
`"......So we've found all five gouged corpses now, in the head, chest, stomach, knee, and leg."`
`"Uuuuhhhghhhhuu, shit, shit shit!!`
` I'll frickin' kill that murderer, kill him!!`
` UwaaAA{0}AAaa{0}aaHHH...!!"`
`"......Everything as far as the eighth twilight is finished now.`
` ...Is this going to continue onto the ninth twilight?`
` ......The witch revives, and none shall be left alive."`
`"Bring it on, dammit...`
` ......When it says the witch revives,`
` ...that means the culprit's gonna make his grand appearance, right?!"`
`"Bull{i:shit} no one's gonna be left alive...`
` ......I'll kill him myself...!`
` I'll make sure I kill whoever murdered Mom and Dad, with my own two hands...!!"`
`Jessica howled furiously, her emotions laid bare.`
` ......To avoid being crushed by her grief, she could do nothing but resist it with anger.`
`".........We still...haven't found George.`
` ...Jessica‐chan, and the rest of you, you can stay here if you want.`
` I'll go to the mansion."`
`"E‐Eva‐san, we mustn't split up...!!`
` It is dangerous if we do not all stick together...!"`
`"There's nothing we can do for Nii‐san or his wife.`
` But George may be still alive somewhere...!`
` I have no time to waste here...!!"`
`As Auntie Eva screamed this, Jessica glared at her.`
`...Auntie Eva had no more time to bother about the dead.`
`{n}She was more concerned for the safety of her only son, who was yet to be seen.`
`"Jessica‐chan, you should stay by your father and mother's side.`
` I'll make a short trip to the mansion.`
` Battler‐kun and Doctor Nanjo, you two can stay here with her as well."`
`After saying this and leaving no time for debate, Auntie Eva rushed out of the arbor.`
`I called out for her to stop, but there was no way she would listen.`
`...However, by now, being alone in this situation meant nothing short of death.`
`If we silently watched her leave, it would be the same as letting her die.`
`{n}As long as Auntie Eva was unwilling to stop, we would have no choice but to follow her.`
`......And, while it may be cruel to say so,`
` Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi were already dead,`
` so there was nothing more we could do for them...`
`In the end, we had no choice but to console Jessica and head for the mansion together.`
`...Fortunately, Jessica stood up.`
`Perhaps she had been able to draw a line under her grief for the moment.`
` ......But, what had surfaced in its place was an expression like a demon.`
`"...I'll murder 'em with my own hands, ......I'll avenge my parents, just you wait.........`
` ......Let's go, Battler.`
` If we find whoever did this, don't get in my way.`
` I'm definitely gonna kill them...!!"`
`".........I also have my parents to avenge.`
` Sorry, but this is first come, first served."`
`"...Yeah, ...that's right...`
` ......Let's make mincemeat of that bastard!"`
`At my words, Jessica finally seemed to feel like someone had sympathized with her emotions.`
`She still had that dark expression, but I felt Jessica regaining some of her sanity.`
`We took off.`
`{n}Chasing after Auntie Eva.`
`Through the rose garden,`
` up the stone steps,`
` running at full speed towards the mansion......whose large, intimidating shadow flashed in the lightning.`
`......With this, the epitaph murders had finished the eighth twilight.`
`{n}And now, on the ninth twilight, the witch will revive.`
`{n}...None shall be left alive.`
`I will most likely lose my life.`
`......But at the very least, I wanted to burn the truth into my eyes.`
`{n}That was the only thing motivating me to move at that moment.`
`We were able to reunite with Auntie Eva, who was having trouble with the lock to the front door.`
`It seemed that all the blood had risen to Auntie Eva's head.`
`{n}That was probably making her fingers clumsy.`
`It seemed she couldn't even handle the simple task of inserting the key into the lock.`
`...Then, there was a faint sound.`
`The sound of the door unlocking.`
` Just as though it had waited for all of the survivors to unite before opening.`
`......It seemed to me as though the malicious mansion...`
`was trying to swallow all of the remaining humans at once...`
`The stench that erupted outwards at the instant the door opened,`
` ...could it really be explained as just a smell?`
`It wasn't just the charred smell from Grandfather.`
`......I think it may also have contained something like...`
`regrets, held by so many dead, including our parents, and all of the servants.`
`...What did it mean as it billowed out, overwhelming us?`
`......Was it the cry of the dead, telling us not to enter?`
`However, Auntie Eva didn't even flinch at something like that.`
`......And we who had to chase after her...`
`were forced to step into the mansion, despite receiving that message...`
`"George?!`
` George!!`
` If you can hear me, answer!`
` Geoooooorge!!"`
`Auntie Eva shouted at the top of her lungs.`
`......Considering the situation, it's probably far too optimistic to imagine that he's alive.`
`When we also started following Auntie Eva's example and calling George‐aniki's name in loud voices...`
`...Auntie Eva found something, and stopped walking.`
`She was standing in front of the door to the parlor.`
`".........What is this.........?`
` D‐Doctor Nanjo, could you come here for a second......?"`
`"Wh‐what is it......?"`
`I had heard from the adults about the creepy magic circles that had been drawn on doors such as the one to the parlor.`
`......Creepy was the only word to describe that thing,`
` which had been scrawled there with a deep‐red paint reminiscent of blood that slowly dripped down.`
`However, that had supposedly been there since this morning.`
`......Wondering why Auntie Eva, who had seen it already,`
` would think it odd now, Jessica and I stared at the door...`
`"......Certainly, .........I have no memory of numbers such as these being written here."`
`"Right, they weren't.`
` ......The creepy magical text was written here, but not the numbers."`
`From what the two of them said, only a magic circle had been there here this morning.`
`However, right now, there were eight digits newly written in the upper part of the magic circle.`
`07151129.`
`...I didn't know what it meant,`
` but I didn't even want to imagine the thought process of whoever wrote this.`
`It was drawn with what was probably the same paint as the magic circle,`
` ...but it had clearly been written very recently.`
`The way it had dried and the condition of the color was completely different from the magic circle part.`
`".........pfeh.`
` I'm sure it just has some magical meaning.`
` It's pointless to rack our brains over it."`
`Jessica intentionally spat those words out in an attempt to wipe out how creepy it was.`
`"It...could be a magic {i:square}.`
` ......The idea that a ward against evil can reside in a certain form of number play.`
` I am sure you have all heard of the one where adding all of the numbers in each row leads to the same sum..."`
`"Wasn't that a group of numbers filled inside a square?`
` This is just a single row.`
` I don't have a clue what it could mean."`
`"......What Jessica‐chan said is probably correct.`
` There isn't any point in us thinking about it deeply..."`
`Even though she said that, she probably suspected that it might actually mean something.`
`Using an old receipt or something from inside her pocket,`
` Auntie Eva deftly wrote that number down with a short ballpoint pen.`
`Because an eight‐digit number would probably be a little difficult to memorize, unless it had some kind of pattern.`
`.................................`
`"......Couldn't...`
`...this be a date,`
` ......or something?"`
`"A date...?`
` What are you talking about...?"`
`"Well, ...it's probably a coincidence,`
` but my birthday...`
`is July 15th.`
` ...Once I thought that 0715 might refer to July 15th,`
` I figured that if 1129 stood for November 29th, maybe that'd fit perfectly..."`
`"............Why would your birthday be written in a place like this?`
` And what's up with November 29th...?"`
`"That's what I wanna know...`
` Still, ...it's probably just a coincidence.`
` When I thought about it, it started to feel a little creepy."`
`"......Is November 29th someone's birthday or something?`
` It's not anyone in my family, not Dad or Kyrie‐san or Ange.`
` And of course, not my mom either."`
`"I cannot think of anything...`
` ...I don't believe it is Kinzo‐san's or Genji‐san's birthday."`
`"It isn't from my family either.`
` And it isn't Rosa's or Maria‐chan's."`
`"It's not anyone in mine, either...`
` And it isn't Kanon‐kun's or Shannon's."`
`"......I always give the servants presents on their birthdays, so I know it for all of them,`
` but I don't know anyone who was born on November 29th..."`
`Once we started imagining that the eight digits, which we had thought were meaningless,`
` were actually two dates written together, it really started to look that way.`
`......However, its true meaning may be something completely different, or there may be no meaning at all.`
`Anyway, since we don't have any real clue, it's probably pointless to stand around here analyzing it.`
`......More important was the inside of the parlor.`
`This morning, behind each of the doors with a magic circle drawn on them, there had been the body of a victim.`
`...And now that a number had been newly added to the door, what new thing {i:had been added} inside the parlor?`
`When Auntie Eva tried to open it, she felt the resistance of the lock.`
`{n}She immediately took out a master key, and put it in the keyhole.`
`As soon as she opened the door, ......Auntie Eva let out a high‐pitched scream and ran inside.`
`That alone was enough to tell us what had happened inside the room...`
`Doctor Nanjo and I looked at each other, and I shook my head slightly as we entered the parlor...`
`"George!!`
` Geooooorge!!`
` Speak to me...!!`
` Geoooooooooorge!!`
` Doctor Nanjo, quickly!!"`
`George‐aniki had fallen alongside Shannon‐chan's body.`
`His chest was stained bright red.`
` And from his still‐opened eyes,`
` ...all my condolences to Auntie Eva,`
` ......but I couldn't pick up any signs of life.`
`After moving to take his pulse,`
` ...Doctor Nanjo shook his head, wordlessly reporting that George‐aniki was dead.`
`Brushing him aside, Auntie Eva once again crouched beside George‐aniki,`
` and started crying at the top of her lungs...`
`With this, ...Aniki's death, one thing had become certain.`
`The murders would not be ending at the eighth twilight.`
`The epitaph was going to be carried out in its complete form, including the ninth twilight, "and none will be left alive"...`
`I'm really starting to lose the plot.`
`...For some reason, Auntie Eva's half‐insane cries and appearance actually made me cool down...`
`...Crestfallen and exhausted, I flopped onto the sofa,`
` and plunked my feet on top of the table.`
`Maybe all of these murders have paralyzed my heart.`
` ......Instead of fright, the stronger emotion I'm feeling is one of complete confusion.`
`Dad and Kyrie‐san have died, and starting with the servants, people have been killed off one by one.`
` ...And at one hell of a pace, too.`
`I don't know what time the first murders started,`
` ...but I'd say we're probably being killed at a rate of about one person an hour.`
`We believe that the boat will come for us around nine tomorrow.`
` ......There's still a full twelve hours until then.`
`...How many more sacrifices to the witch would there have to be for us to survive...?`
`With the four of us, if one goes each hour, ...we won't last any longer than four hours.`
` It's not clear anymore if we'll even last until midnight tonight...`
`......Yesterday, after lunch, we came into this parlor.`
`At about the time that the discussion had turned to the black tea that Auntie Rosa said she bought,`
` we kids had started talking about going to take a walk.`
`......Maria was fooling around.`
`...Didn't Shannon‐chan bring us some cookies?`
`She said that Kumasawa‐san had baked them, or something.`
`......I'd probably have laughed my ass off if there had actually been a cooked mackerel one mixed in with them.`
`............That's right, I'll never hear Kumasawa baa‐chan's mackerel jokes again, will I...`
`...Oh yeah, if I only remember stuff about Kumasawa baa‐chan, that wouldn't be fair to everyone else...`
`.........Why did Dad and Kyrie‐san...even go outside?`
`It's not like we'd die from being without food for a day.`
`...So why did gluttony get ahold of them and make them go to get food?`
`......I'll bet it was my fearless dad who started complaining about being hungry...`
`Kyrie‐san, you were supposed to be the brakes for my reckless dad...`
` Why didn't you stop him?`
`.........And what about your daughter Ange...?`
`...She's only six years old.`
`{n}You weren't thinking of entrusting her to me, were you...?`
`At this point, it's doubtful that even I will be able to leave this island alive.........`
`"St‐stop this...!!`
` Why are you fighting at a time such as this...?!`
` Jessica‐san, stop...!!"`
`......Some kind of commotion was interrupting my thoughts.`
`I looked up to see what it was, and saw that Jessica and Auntie Eva had started fighting each other at some point.`
`......No, maybe I should say that Jessica was grabbing at Auntie Eva.`
`"......You killed my mom and dad!!`
` There's no other explanation!!"`
`"Don't be stupid!!`
` How would I know anything about what happened to your parents?!"`
`"Who was downstairs in the guesthouse?!`
` You were!!`
` Mom and Dad were in the downstairs lobby, along with YOU!`
` Who was left alive?!`
` Only YOU!!`
` Why?"`
`"Because you're the {i:fucking murderer}, that's why goddammit!!`
` You killed Mom and Dad, carried them outside, and then shamelessly locked the door,`
` trying to make it seem like it was the frickin' witch's doing...!!"`
`"Then why did George go missing?!`
` He didn't come downstairs, you know?!`
` So did he disappear from upstairs?!"`
`"Who was upstairs?!`
` It was you people who were up there!!`
` You knew, didn't you?!`
` You knew that George slipped out of the mansion!!`
` You brazenly made a face as if you didn't know anything!!`
` If you had stopped George, he would, ......he would...!!!"`
`"I am telling you to stop...!`
` Jessica‐san was in the cousins' room the whole time!`
` And Eva‐san was also in the downstairs lobby the whole time!`
` And neither of you are responsible for anything!`
` This is only the sadness of losing your family...!!"`
`"The culprit is no one, is nowhere...!!`
` It is all.........just the witch's fault, that is all!!`
` So you two, please, stop hating one another...!!"`
`......The witch's fault, is it...`
`{n}I wonder if that's a good way to mediate things for now.`
`Yes, ...I finally understand the meaning of all of the doors and windows having been {i:locked from the inside} when three whole people evaporated from the guesthouse...`
`This is what they were after.`
`......Making us think the culprit was inside, ...and causing this ugly mutual hatred...`
`....had to be the culprit's......the witch's goal.`
`............But in that case, how had the culprit {i:locked it from the outside}...?`
`It's certainly true that the master key had been stolen when Dad's group was attacked.`
`...But the doors and windows to the guesthouse...`
`had been constructed so that you couldn't lock them from the outside no matter how hard you tried.`
`So that master key shouldn't mean anything for the guesthouse locked room...`
`......Jessica and Auntie Eva were turning their sadness at losing their blood relatives into anger at the person in front of them.`
`Doctor Nanjo was trying to step between them.`
`......And I sat haphazardly in a sofa staring up at the ceiling,`
` ......thinking about things that didn't even matter anymore with a worn‐out expression.`
`............I just couldn't believe that this was the same parlor that had been so warm and pleasant midday yesterday,`
` ...for just a short time before the typhoon hit......`
`"GYAAAAaAAaaAAAaaaAAA......`
`uWAA{0}AAuu{0}ughhaAA{0}AAUU{0}UUgghh{0}hhh...!!"`
`The sudden sound of a gunshot shook me out of my half‐asleep trance.`
`...Smoke was rising out of the barrel of the gun Auntie Eva held.`
`Jessica was rolling around on the floor, covering both her eyes.`
`Auntie Eva and Doctor Nanjo were looking down at her, shocked...`
`"A‐are you alright, Jessica‐san...?!`
` Jessica‐san...!!"`
`"UuuAaaaAAAaaaaHHHaHHHhhh,`
` oww, owwww, ow...`
`uuuaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaggghhh...!"`
`"I‐......it isn't my fault...`
` Th‐......this happened because you came at me even after I told you to stop...!"`
`"H‐...hey, hey, what the hell happened, what's going on...?!"`
`Jessica had grabbed at Auntie Eva, and it had turned into a scuffle...`
`They had then...started fighting over the gun Auntie Eva had been holding?`
`And some movement or other caused the trigger to be pulled...?`
`I didn't know the details, about whether the bullet had grazed her, or whether she had been burned by the discharge,`
` but whatever the case, Jessica was covering both of her eyes, screaming in pain, and rolling around on the floor.`
`"......It's alright, calm down...!`
` It is not a serious wound, so get ahold of yourself...!"`
`"My eyes hurt, it hurts...`
` ...I can't see,`
` ...I can't see......!!"`
`Doctor Nanjo lent Jessica his shoulder, saying that he would tend to her in the servant room.`
`......The servant room in this mansion apparently had a bed and a first aid kit, and was able to function as an infirmary.`
`"Damn iiiiiit!!`
` You killed Mom and Dad!!`
` I'll kill you... I'll kill you......!!"`
`"I‐......it wasn't me... It wasn't me......!!"`
`"Jessica‐san, you are aggravating the wound, so please, stop struggling...!`
` Come, let us go to the servant room..."`
`Jessica still continued to curse Auntie Eva as her parents' murderer.`
`{n}It seemed that Auntie Eva couldn't conceal her shock at the fact that she had pulled the trigger, even if it had been an accident.`
`"...It wasn't my fault... That kid jumped at me, that's why this happened......`
` ......I didn't kill anyone..."`
`"......No, forget that... Who killed George?`
` That's right, who killed George?!!`
` George, Geooooooooooorge!!`
` It isn't my fault, it isn't my fault...!!"`
`"W‐wait a sec, Auntie Eva...!!`
` Don't go off on your own!!"`
`I didn't know whether it was because Auntie Eva couldn't stand her mistake,`
` or whether it was because she had lost herself to anger at the person who had killed her only son,`
` ...or whether it was both of those all mixed together.`
`...In any case, she ran out into the corridor, yelling, fearful, and shouting.`
`I was also worried about Jessica's condition, but anyway, right then, I couldn't leave Auntie Eva alone.`
`Why would she go off on her own in this mansion, of all places? Is she suicidal...?!`
`Doctor Nanjo took Jessica towards the servant room.`
`...I chased after Auntie Eva, dashing into the depths of the mansion......`
`After sitting Jessica on the servant room bed,`
` Nanjo told her several times not to rub her eyes, and examined the affected area.`
`The barrel had probably been near her eyes.`
`{n}There was a possibility that the flames from the discharge had damaged her corneas.`
`...There was no threat to her life, but it would probably be necessary to have a suitable doctor look at her as soon as humanly possible.`
`Nanjo applied emergency first aid, covering the affected area with gauze and wrapping it with a bandage.`
` As a result, Jessica completely lost her field of vision...`
`"Now, pay attention...`
` This wound may hurt or itch, but you must not scratch at it or rub it.`
` When tomorrow comes, let us go to an ophthalmologist as soon as possible."`
`"......That bitch, ...she really was trying to kill me...`
` If the angle had been just a little bit off, I'd have been killed by now...`
` I'll definitely turn her in to the police......!"`
`"...Eva‐san would not do such a thing.`
` That was an accident."`
`"Accident my ass...!`
` She killed Mom and Dad.`
` There's no way any 19th person or witch exists on this island...!!`
` She's behind everything.`
` She was the only one on the first floor of the guesthouse!"`
`"George nii‐san must have seen her kill Mom and Dad, and she killed him to keep him silent!!`
` It's the same with Grandfather and the servants.`
` I'm sure she snuck out of the family conference last night and killed all of them...!!"`
`"......I‐if that is the case, then we will know as soon as the police investigate."`
`"The police are incredible, you know—there is nothing that cannot be understood by a forensic investigator.`
` ......There is no need for us to suspect or hate anyone.`
` The police will resolve everything."`
`"So for now, Jessica‐san, you should concentrate on resting your body and making things easy on your eyes.`
` ...If you wrinkle your forehead too much, it will do no good for your eyes, of course, and nothing for your looks either."`
`Indeed, when Jessica had grown agitated in her verbal abuse of Eva,`
` she had naturally started glaring, and the pressure on her eyes hurt her.`
`Jessica herself soon realized that the more she talked, the more the wound would hurt,`
` and regardless of whether she had overcome her suspicions of Eva, she regained her composure for the time being...`
`"......She killed them...`
` ......Mom and Dad.`
` ......And Shannon,`
` .........and Kanon‐kun...`
` ............Kanon‐kun........."`
`She had heard that Kanon had been killed in the chapel.`
`{n}...Jessica still hadn't seen his face after he had died.`
`Jessica was now less fearful about the fact that she might go blind,`
` and more frightened that the police would carry Kanon's corpse away while she still couldn't see,`
` and that she would have to say her final farewell without being able to see his face.`
`Her anger at the culprit, and her sadness at the death of the person she had liked.`
`{n}...Those mixed emotions provoked her tear ducts.`
`But right now, tears were actually painful for her,`
` so she wasn't even permitted to leisurely remember the late Kanon's face...`
`Jessica could do nothing but sit on the bed and let her head droop, withstanding the pain...`
`"..................`
` ...Well, now it is Eva‐san I must be concerned for.`
` I hope she isn't too shaken by this."`
`Letting out a small sigh of relief that Jessica had calmed down for the time being,`
` he stuck his head out into the hallway to look for any sign of the others coming back.`
`"..............."`
`They...met eyes.`
`{n}Nanjo, unable to understand who this person was, was bewildered for an instant.`
`"I hear that people who have lost the power of sight have zero anti‐magic power and zero magic resistance.`
` In other words, you're an isolated pawn right now.`
` Understand what that meeeans?"`
`"......Wh‐......what did you say......?"`
`There was no possible way that Nanjo could have understood who the person in front of him was.`
` ...And there was certainly no possible way that he could ever have understood what she had just said.`
`".........Doctor Nanjo?`
` What's going on......?"`
`Unable to see, Jessica couldn't tell what was going on except by whatever voice she heard.`
`{n}...But since she had heard Nanjo say something with an uneasy tone,`
` she tightened up, thinking that something bad might have happened.`
`"S‐......stop, please......!`
` Please don't kill me...!!`
` I have a sick grandchild...!`
` I can't die here...!`
` For mercy's sake, spare me...!!`
` HIIIii!!!"`
`"...Doctor Nanjo...?`
` Doctor Nanjo?!"`
`Jessica couldn't do anything except call out from the bed.`
`{n}...Judging by the tone of his voice, Nanjo was in the corridor, being confronted by someone.`
`And he was scared.`
` There was no doubt that at this very moment, his life was being threatened.`
`"No, don't!!`
` HiiiIIIIiIIIII!!!"`
`"On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive.`
` Kuhhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!!"`
`The witch pointed the end of her gold staff at Nanjo.`
`...Even though he didn't know what she was planning to do,`
` Nanjo imagined that she must be trying to take his life.`
`"Doctor Nanjo!!`
` Doctor Nanjo!!`
` Who's out there?!`
` Answer me!!"`
`"Please, nooooOoOOOo, ahii{0}ie{0}eeEAAH{0}HHhhh!!"`
`Bang!`
` A sharp sound echoed.`
`And tapered to a point just as sharp, the elongated tip of the golden staff was stuck straight into Nanjo's forehead...`
`Jessica, who only had her ears to help her try to grasp what was happening, had no clue what was going on.`
`...But even so, she was able to realize that with that sound, Nanjo had died.`
`And the person who had killed him was now in the corridor, right in front of the servant room.`
`{n}...Furthermore, since she couldn't see, she wouldn't even be able to run away, much less resist.`
`...Upon discovering that she was in a life‐or‐death situation, caught like a rat in a trap, Jessica felt her blood run cold...`
`"......Oh, Jessica.`
` Poor girl, you injured your eyes.`
` ...In that case, you can't even escape, can you?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*.`
` ...I'm gonna play a whole lot with Nanjo's corpse now.`
` ...When I get bored of that, I'll kill you next and play a bunch more."`
`"......No, wait, it's not every day that you get blinded, right?`
` ......I won't wait until I kill you.`
` I'll play with you a bunch {i:before} I kill you too.`
` ...Kuhhihya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya...!!`
` So wait there shaking for a while, okay?`
` As you try to imagine all the ways I'm playing with Nanjo's corpse!!"`
`"H‐...hiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!"`
`Struck with fear, Jessica let out a frail scream.`
`......She really wanted to scream in a much louder voice, trying to get someone to help her.`
`But she couldn't.`
`When a person is faced with true fear, it clogs up their throat...`
`Right now, Jessica could barely even breathe.`
`"H‐`
`......help...`
` ......Help.........!!`
` HiIIiiIiiIIi!!"`
`She searched around with her hands, trying to find some way to escape.`
` But even though she knew this room well, just being unable to see made it like a locked room of darkness.`
`She bumped into some shelves or something, and some tins of sweets and bottles and things fell down from them, hitting her on the head.`
`...As she was now, even protecting her head to block them wasn't working out.`
`...She was becoming painfully aware of how very powerless humans become just by losing their sense of sight.`
`{n}Of course, she had no time to appreciate that.`
`She crawled around, as best as she could, trying to escape that place,`
` but she kept bumping into things that she didn't understand, getting hit by various falling objects,`
` and it felt to her like the entire room was alive, bullying her and refusing to let her escape.`
`Then, she heard footsteps from the presence in the hallway.`
`{n}And then a voice.`
`......The person had probably peered into the room since Jessica was making so much noise.`
`"What a racket you're making.`
` Sit on the bed and wait quietly like a lady.`
` 'Cause I'll give you a wonderful blood‐red death costume fitting for a lady of class.`
` ......Something good enough to make the person who finds you faint, okay?`
` Gehhe{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}heh!!"`
`"Hii...hiiIIiiIIIIiiiiiiIIIi!!"`
`Just a short while ago, she had sworn that she would kill the culprit if she found them.`
`...However, she was now all too powerless.`
`She couldn't do anything except let out feeble screams and crawl around on the floor, bumping her head into the bed and the legs of desks.`
`"Help... Help......!`
` Someone, help......!!`
` Dad, ......Mom...!`
` Battleeeer......!`
` Someone, coooooooome...!!`
` .........Help me, ......Kanon‐kun.........!!"`
`In the corridor, as the witch thought of how to toy with Nanjo's life...`
`......a single gold butterfly secretly watched that scene from the corner of the hallway.`
`...It was Beato, who had barely escaped with her life once before.`
`The gold butterfly softly returned to human form.`
` ...Its form was faint and transparent like a lace curtain.`
`Even just the power to hold a human form had become scarce for her.`
`Right next to her, Ronove also appeared.`
`"......Jessica will probably be unable to survive.`
` ...Although, no one was to be left alive since the beginning."`
`"..................She has grown feelings of love for Kanon.`
` ......I have even toyed with that at times.`
` ............However, I know that now to be something shameful for a witch."`
`"......Love is the single element.`
` Romantic love is even more pure, more sacred.`
` ...Though, for some reason, you hate it very much, Milady."`
`".................................`
` ......Master told me.`
` ...Magic exists to bring people happiness.`
` ...I'm sure that I knew that once."`
`"......And from the moment I forgot that, I was no longer a witch.`
` ......So I...lost the qualifications to be Battler's opponent..."`
`".........Milady, I hesitate to ask, but...`
`...surely you do not intend to rescue Jessica?`
` That would be dangerous."`
`"I understand...`
` Even if I save her, she will become a plaything of the witch's banquet when the door to the Golden Land opens."`
`"......But even so, ...that would be much more compassionate than the way that person would kill her.`
` ...The witch's banquet steals lives in a terrible way, but it does not do so more than once.`
` It does not toy with life and death."`
`"...However, she is different.`
` She kills over and over.`
` She kills for fun!`
` There is not even a trace of compassion there.`
` .........I want to at least save Jessica from that kind of cruel fate."`
`"......Certainly, by carrying that out, you would probably be praised as a good witch."`
`"......However, the new {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama already views you as hostile, Milady.`
` ...If you were to be seen by her again, ......you are aware, you would have no way to escape this time?"`
`".......................................`
` ......When I reunited George with Shannon,`
` .........I finally understood what a witch is,`
` and what magic is."`
`".........I am a witch.`
` I must be a witch.`
` And I must be acknowledged by Battler as his opponent, ......and I must make him accept me as a witch this time at last."`
`"......The road to that goal may be long and difficult.`
` ...However, if I do not take a step forward here and now, ......I cannot call myself a witch."`
`"I understand your feelings, but how do you plan to rescue her?`
` There are not many forms of magic that your body is capable of now, Milady.`
` Did you not have to borrow George's power even back when you revived Shannon?"`
`"......Mm.`
` ...And for that very reason, I may be able to save Jessica at least."`
`"......Right now, she is begging for Kanon to save her.`
` ......If I can borrow the power of that emotion, I may be able to knock on the doors of Hades once again with my magical power."`
`"I am sure you would be able.`
` However, you would use up all of your magical power.`
` ......If you were to be spotted by the new {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, you would truly be without a method of escape."`
`"...I am no longer your butler, Milady.`
` ......Understand that I cannot assist you if the situation worsens."`
`"...I know.`
` .........By now, I have toyed with and taken more lives than I can count.`
` ...So I may not be able to compensate for that sin except by saving the same number of lives."`
`"......I have nothing to lose in the first place.`
` ...I am just a golden butterfly who has passed its name and magic power on, and who is no longer accepted as a witch."`
`".........What about Battler‐sama?`
` You are part‐way through a game with him.`
` He has said that he would wait until you returned, Milady."`
`"...Is it alright for you to expire here?`
` ...You have a duty to return to the seat across from Battler‐sama, Milady."`
`"For that very reason...!`
` If there is a life that only I can save, I choose to save it."`
`"And I will be accepted as a witch.`
` ......I must be a witch...!`
` If this is a test, it is a very childish one, unfitting for the evils I have committed until now."`
`"......Go, hide yourself, Ronove.`
` Watch what may be the final magic of a single butterfly who used to be called a Golden Witch...!"`
`"......Certainly.`
` ......Please show me magic...`
`...that will not disgrace the name of the Golden Witch.`
` ......I pray that it will not be your last."`
`"Go, my friend.`
` ...If there is enough ink, pen the story of my foolish life, and hand it to some fool attempting to walk the same path.`
` Farewell, Ronove...!"`
`"Kanon‐kun,`
` ......where are you...`
`where are you......`
` ...Help me,`
` ......help me...`
` ...uuuu...u...uuuu..."`
`.........Milady.`
` I am always...waiting by your side.`
`"K‐......Kanon‐kun......?`
` Kanon‐kun......?!"`
`Jessica thought that she had just heard Kanon's voice.`
` She looked around with unseeing eyes, but of course, there was no way for her to see anything.`
`...On the contrary, that action caused her head to hit the desk again.`
`"......Kanon‐kun, .........Kanon‐kun......`
` ...Help me, .........help me........."`
`Yes, Milady.`
` ...I will...help you.`
`"K‐......Kanon‐kun...?!`
` Y‐you were alive...?!"`
`This time, she thought that she had heard his voice clearly.`
`{n}Jessica jumped up in surprise, banging her head against the desk once again.`
`......Milady, please calm your heart and listen.`
`...Unfortunately, I am not alive.`
`".........Huh......?"`
`I have already...died.`
`......However, ...that witch came to me to tell me of your peril.`
`...Then, she gave me only a short period of time to help you, Milady.`
`Please, calm your heart even more.`
`If you do, ......my form will become visible even to you, Milady...`
`Jessica obeyed those words.`
`{n}She chased all idle thoughts from her head, and relaxed her breathing.`
`......Her heart actually felt like it was going to explode after hearing the voice of the loved one she thought was dead.`
`She resisted that with all of her strength.`
`......When she did, ......she could feel that Kanon‐kun really was right in front of her.`
`......Even though she was unable to see, ......somehow, she was still able to sense him clearly.`
`"......Can you...see me?`
` Milady..."`
`"Yeah...`
` I can see, ......I can definitely see you, Kanon‐kun..."`
`".........I exist only as a spirit.`
` So I cannot touch you, Milady.`
` I cannot do anything except talk to you like this.`
` ......I am a weak existence which can do nothing more than that, ...but I should be able to be of some aid to you, Milady."`
`"......Just words, ......that's all......?`
` I can't......touch you, Kanon‐kun......?"`
`"I am now even more fragile than smoke from a candle.`
` ...So much so, that if one of the living such as you were to touch me, I would be wiped away instantly.`
` ......So please, don't try to touch me.`
` ...Because I am also......holding back my desire......to touch you, Milady."`
`"Ah, .........y‐...yeah..."`
`"More importantly, Milady.`
` ......Please listen well.`
` .........The new Golden Witch is the owner of a cruel heart.`
` ...She will surely try to make you meet with a horrible end.`
` ......You must escape from this room and hide."`
`"H‐...how...?`
` I can't...see anything......!"`
`"Quiet...`
` ......I will be your eyes, Milady.`
` Please move in accordance with my instructions.`
` ......First, please crawl three steps from there, and then stand up.`
` You are currently under the desk, Milady.`
` If you stand there, you'll hit your head."`
`"...Th‐that was under the desk...?`
` I got it... One, two, three...`
` ...Standing up..."`
`"Well done......`
` Next, please turn towards nine o'clock.`
` .........Yes, well done."`
`"Ha, ......haha...`
` This is pretty...embarrassing...`
` ......Ah, ...ack, ...owowow..."`
`"Are you alright? Does your wound hurt...?"`
`"N‐No, ...I'm fine...`
` What next......?"`
`Jessica thought that if this was a dream, she didn't want to wake up.`
`{n}...And, if she were allowed to, she would have wanted to take off the bandage covering her eyes and see him.`
`...However, if she did that, surely Kanon would vanish like frail candle smoke, just like he himself had said...`
` ......She was afraid of that.`
`So she satisfied herself with just being able to hear his words once more,`
` repressing her desire to see him, to hold him.`
`So what hurt her eyes now were tears of gratitude.`
`{n}......Tears of gratitude for the god, ...or else witch, who had given her this miraculous moment.`
`"...Is this okay...?`
` If we keep talking like this, won't we be noticed by her?`
` Won't our voices be heard...?"`
`"......I have erected a stealth barrier.`
` If you don't make any loud noises or speak noisily, no one will notice.`
` ......That is why no one can notice my presence."`
`"...I, ...I don't really get it, ...but anyway, we'll be okay as long as we stay quiet, right...?`
` ......Wh‐what should I do next...?"`
`"Please walk ten steps, slowly, in the direction you're facing.`
` You will touch the sofa.`
` Please continue along that.`
` ......Do it slowly.`
` ......Stay calm.`
` Believe my words."`
`"Su‐......sure.`
` ............Heheh, ...it's weird...`
` ......Even though it was so scary not being able to see, .........when you're with me, Kanon‐kun, it isn't scary at all..."`
`".........Yes, that is the sofa.`
` Trace it to the left while advancing slowly...`
` There is a table just to the left.`
` Be careful not to bump into it with your shins..."`
`......It was a very, very peculiar and magical team effort.`
`Even though she would be killed in an instant if she was noticed by the terrible witch,`
` ......there was no fear in Jessica's heart right then.`
`She was being protected and guided by Kanon, who she had thought she would never be able to meet with again.`
`...It was probably only a momentary miracle.`
`{n}......But even so, Jessica was deeply grateful for it.`
`If she hoped for too much, she was sure that he would disappear—so, in order not to break this transient miracle...`
`...and in order to engrave this moment into her heart for all eternity...{0}she slowly...{0}slowly...{0}continued to walk...{0}obeying Kanon's voice...`
`"......Alright, if you walk ten more steps, you will exit the servant room.`
` Then, please turn to face nine o'clock, and keep walking very slowly.`
` Put your hand on the wall to your right, and keep on following that.`
` ...I will take you to a safe room."`
`"............If I go there,`
` ...will you...`
`.........leave me again, Kanon‐kun......?"`
`"..........................."`
`Kanon didn't answer.`
`{n}...But even his lack of an answer was enough to let her know that was the truth.`
`"......Then, ......no.`
` .........I don't want to go..."`
`"If you stay here, you will be killed by the witch."`
`"That's alright...`
` If I'm killed, I can go to the world where you are, Kanon‐kun..."`
`"......Milady,`
` please be reasonable.`
` ......For the dead such as myself, the human world is too bright and painful...`
` So I cannot stay for long."`
`"So Milady, ......with the time I am allowed, ......please permit me to guide you to a safe place.`
` ............And after that, .........I will stay with you until my time runs out."`
`".........Is that...the best you can do, Kanon‐kun......?"`
`"...Yes.`
` .........And in exchange, I will stay by your side for every second I can, Milady.`
` ......The whole time, I will be with you, ......and I will talk with you, Milady."`
`"Talk...about what...?"`
`"..................What would you like me to talk about...?"`
`"...Anything...that you're willing to..."`
`"......Well then...`
` ............I will tell you the story of a cowardly servant boy without courage.`
` .........About a foolish and pitiful boy who felt love for a lady as radiant as the sun, ...and who, even though those same feelings were confessed to him,`
` ......lost to his cowardice, and in the end, was not able to be true to himself while he still lived."`
`"...............Yeah...`
` Then, ...I want to tell one too.`
` .........The story of a cowardly girl, ......who couldn't muster her courage...`
`...to keep telling the boy she loved just how much she loved him."`
`"......And, ......about how God gave her a miracle to be reunited with that boy,`
` ............and how, when she was given one more chance to muster up her courage, .........she did."`
`".........I also......want to hear that.`
` ......So, for that reason as well, let us go.`
` ......To a safe place."`
`"......Yeah...`
` If I could be with you, Kanon‐kun, I would walk however long, however far...`
` I don't need eyes anymore.`
` If you told me to step forward, I would even take a step off a cliff."`
`"Thank you.`
` ...Well then, Milady.`
` Let us go.`
` The first ten steps."`
`"No... Not like that.`
` ...Not unless you call me............Jessica."`
`"......Understood.`
` .....................Well then, Jessica.`
` ...Take the first ten steps."`
`"Yeah.`
` Kanon‐kun......"`
`Quietly, quietly, Jessica and Kanon snuck slowly out of the servant room.`
`Directly around the corner, the witch could be seen cruelly looking down upon Nanjo's corpse,`
` but the witch did not even notice their presence.`
`However, Ronove, who was waiting at her side, met Kanon's eyes.`
`...Kanon thought "oh no", grimacing and blocking Jessica with his back.`
`"........................"`
`However, Ronove did not inform his master.`
`As though it had been his imagination that he ever spotted him in the first place, he pretended to know nothing.`
`......No, maybe he did appear to chuckle.`
`From a finger on one of Ronove's hands, which were joined behind his back, a single small gold butterfly appeared,`
` flying in front of Kanon as though guiding him.`
`It was undetectable by the master he served.`
`Kanon was surprised at the magic that butterfly held.`
`Because it was far more powerful than the stealth barrier Kanon had.`
`...He may not have known, but that power had originally been Ronove's.`
`...An imitation of that had been given to Kanon by Kinzo, and that was what Kanon was using now.`
`As that butterfly of stealth magic scattered gold scales, it grew smaller bit by bit.`
` ...It probably wouldn't last long.`
`......But without a doubt, even that would buy them enough time to get far away from the cruel witch.`
`"Alright, Milady...`
` Let's follow that wall and keep walking.`
` ...On and on.`
` And on."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......If I can be with you, Kanon‐kun, ......I'll keep on walking, on and on, as far as you want to go..."`
`Led and protected by the small gold butterfly,`
` ...the two who were separated by the wall between life and death slowly walked away towards the end of the corridor...`
`......There was no way that the evil witch would have any magic to notice their flight.`
`Until they had already disappeared down the other end of the corridor, the witch never noticed that Jessica had vanished...`
`By the time the gold butterfly that Ronove had cast out evaporated completely, ...Jessica had reached the parlor.`
`Even though she would have been able to make it this far in no time if she had been able to see, as she was now, it had been a long, long adventure.`
`"......Now, Milady.`
` We've reached the parlor.`
` I will now take you to the bundle of curtains by the window.`
` ...If you hide in there, you'll surely be safe."`
`"Inside the curtains...`
` Not bad.`
` I used to hide in there a lot, long ago."`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama..."`
`"...Huh?"`
`Kanon called the witch's name.`
` Jessica looked around in surprise, but being unable to see, she obviously couldn't find the witch...`
`Beato had appeared once again with a faint form.`
`{n}Kanon squared off against the evil witch, but Beato's expression was soft, ...and actually pitying.`
`"I don't understand what kind of whim drove you to revive me... Your feelings elude me."`
`"......It was a whim and nothing more.`
` ......No, ......this is how witches should be.`
` ...It took me one thousand years to realize that.`
` ...That is all... A foolish tale."`
`"Wh‐......who?!`
` Who's there...?!"`
`"...Milady, be quiet.`
` ......She is the witch, ...{f:5:Beatrice}...`
` .........I am in her debt, ......because she let me be with you one more time."`
`"............The witch.........{f:5:Beatrice}......"`
`"...I am unimportant.`
` I suggest you instead make haste in hiding that girl in the shadows of the curtains.`
` .........You probably do not have much time left.`
` You should spend it in a final conversation with Jessica."`
`"...A secret meeting inside a bundle of curtains... You two have quite the sense of style.`
` *cackle*cackle*..."`
`"Uh, umm, ............thank you, {f:5:Beatrice}...!!`
` Thank you for letting me be with Kanon‐kun......!!"`
`Jessica didn't know where Beato was, so she said that while facing in the wrong direction.`
`Perhaps because she found that funny, Beato snickered.`
`"I will now leave this room to the pair of lovers.`
` Evil witches have no need for tales of love, you see.`
` Allow me to retreat."`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...`
` ...Thank you very much."`
`"Hmph...`
` .........No need to thank me.`
` You know well that something like this isn't enough to compensate for all of the evil I have done."`
`"I give my gratitude to good witches as a parting gift.`
` ...I don't care about what happened before now, or what will happen in the future.`
` ......All I know is that, in this very moment,`
` ...you are without a doubt...a good witch."`
`"......You flatter me, furniture.`
` The next time we meet, I may be an evil witch who will not betray your expectations.`
` ......And with that, farewell."`
`Beato left the parlor and closed the door.`
`And mustering the last of her remaining magical power, she sealed the door.`
`The fact that those two had escaped into here would eventually be noticed.`
`...And now that the ninth twilight had been reached, no matter how much they struggled, their inescapable fate had already been decided.`
`However, until that final moment, they should be permitted the time to speak with each other of their love.`
`The witch poured out all of her magical power to protect their time together.`
`......So that no one would be able to defile their time alone together until the final moment.`
`Just then, ...Beato perceived something.`
`......Her body had been detected by a magical searching technique.`
`...The cruelhearted witch's furniture had sniffed this place out.`
`"............So, boorishness is the witch's way of doing things...`
` To think that she doesn't even intend to allow the two young ones to speak to each other of their love...`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!!"`
`"45, data received.`
` Comparing target, confirmed as the Predecessor Lady {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Analyzing parlor defensive wall.`
` Multilayered defensive wall, 72 layers, attack barrier and magic reactive armor.`
` Sniping into the parlor is impossible.`
` Data link to 410."`
`"410, data received. Nihi!`
` Then we've just gotta{0}{nobreak:{m:-5:——}—}{0}the Predecessor first nyeh.`
` Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}, permission to fire, please!"`
`"Go ahead and shoot.`
` ...Oh, and avoid her vital areas.`
` There's something I want to ask that old hag."`
`"410, firing.`
` Nihi!"`
`The Chiester Sisters' gold bow released a golden snake.`
`......It crawled down the corridor starting from the front of the servant room, drawing a soft, serpentine curved trajectory as it made for the parlor,`
` ...and struck through Beato's chest.`
`"..................guhahh......!!!"`
`Gold butterflies gathered, and the cruel witch showed herself there along with her furniture.`
`"......Predecessor‐sama.`
` You will not get away with obstructing us a second time."`
`"......ugh......u......... I never thought I would...`
` ......Still, the Chiester Sisters really have gotten rusty.`
` To think that they failed to bring me down.`
` ...And twice, at that...!"`
`Ronove spoke in a manner fitting for the witch's butler.`
`{n}As she pushed her pain aside, Beato grinned and spoke back.`
`"My, my apologies, Predecessor‐sama...!`
` We were ordered to avoid vital areas...!"`
`"As soon as there's an order, we can pierce you at any time.`
` Through your earring holes, your belly button hole, any hole you like.`
` Nihi!"`
`The gold snake that had shot through Beato grew even longer, drawing a helix like a morning glory vine, and awaited its next order.`
`...It was ready to pierce a vital spot as soon as the merciless witch told it to.`
`".........For what reason would someone like you, who is even more brutal than me,`
` make them avoid my vital areas?`
` New {f:5:Beatrice}...!!"`
`"I wanted to ask you.`
` ...I don't know what trick you used to escape, but we were under the impression we had taken you out, you know?"`
`"Why is it that even though you could have escaped by hiding, you took the risk of appearing again?`
` ......It can't be that you came back just to protect those two young people, surely?"`
`"......Well, ...who knows?`
` ......*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"And just a second ago.`
` Why'd you do something as soft as reviving the lovers and reuniting them?`
` ...The more I hear about you, the more I learn that I don't even reach up to your feet as an incarnation of evil."`
`"If you're like that, why did you suddenly start acting so mildly?`
` ......That's what I wanted to ask."`
`".........*cackle*cackle*!`
` Because I am brutal, I am fickle.`
` How could there be any meaning in asking that?"`
`"Chiester Sisters. Sew her."`
`When she ordered that, the gold snake that was curled in a helix and suspended in space...`
`moved as fast as a real snake going after its prey,`
` and pierced Beato's body multiple times from the front and the back, its golden tail drawing a {p:0:×} shape.`
`As the ruthless witch had ordered, it drew a cross‐stitch through Beato's chest.`
`The gold thread made a squeaking sound and tormented Beato...`
`Rather than a gold snake aiming for its prey,`
` it waited for orders in midair as if it was a sewing needle ready to sew Beato.`
`"When it comes to you, there's no way it was a whim.`
` ......I've heard about you.`
` And I've learned.`
` You are such an incarnation of evil that I don't even rise up to your feet.`
` I thought I was truly a fitting successor to you."`
`"......But you've always been in the way.`
` You always say warm, pleasant things that shock me.`
` ......What changed you?`
` You explored the depths of evil for one thousand years,`
` so I let you live just to find out...what happened to overturn that millennium?"`
`"......If you want to know, I suggest you too spend a thousand years finding out.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Sew her."`
`"Gwaahhhh!!!`
` Ackkah, ......gahah!!"`
`Beato's chest was once again sewn with a golden cross‐stitch.`
`It tightened once again, squeezing fresh blood from Beato's chest.`
`The intense pain it caused ran in conflict with its beauty to the eye.`
`".........You might actually be another one of those types who disappear when they die and don't leave a corpse.`
` So I'll kill you slowly."`
`"But if you answer my questions honestly, I'll kill you gently.`
` I'll give you a splendid, gorgeous death perfect for my predecessor.`
` I'll sink you in a coffin filled with water and roses.`
` Isn't that wonderful?`
` ...And you still won't talk?`
` About the reason for your change of heart."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...!!`
` Not answering what she is asked is also one of the pleasures of an evil witch."`
`"Sew her. Twice."`
`"Gyoah, gwuhaahh.........!!"`
`"Of course, you don't have to answer.`
` After all, that way I get to torture you.`
` Kuukuhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!!"`
`"The Endless Magic, the Infinite Magic, truly is wonderful.`
` ...When you think about it, this world is finite in every way.`
` The infinite cannot exist in the human world.`
` Because God is infinite, he deprived the human world of all infinities so that he could look down upon it."`
`"...So, in other words, the power of the infinite is the power of God!`
` A wonderful power where the more you play with it, the more fun ways of playing you find!`
` You used that power as you pleased for one thousand years and went on a rampage!`
` Why are you having a change of heart only now?`
` Don't tell me you just {i:miss} it now that you handed it over to me?"`
`"How could I miss it.`
` The Endless Magic is not magic as you believe it to be.`
` ...True magic is in a deep abyss that you most certainly cannot reach."`
`"And you realized what that is......?`
` What...is it?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Wander around for a thousand years without realizing that, you foolish witch."`
`"Sew her. Three times this time."`
`"Gwoah, gyuooh, ...guhh...!!!"`
`They continued embroidering Beato's chest with the gold thread.`
`{n}It tightened even more, causing Beato more and more pain...`
`"......Well, whatever.`
` I'm not the least bit interested anymore in what deep understanding some good‐as‐dead hag came to.`
` I'm bored now, so I'll kill you quickly.`
` If I kill you, the barrier to the parlor will be undone."`
`"......Then I'll torture Kanon and Jessica to death a whole bunch of times.`
` ......Being able to have two lovers as my toys at the same time, ......sounds fun, right?`
` Kuhhi{0}hi{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hhi{0}hi{0}hihihi!!`
` Kill her...!!!"`
`Without missing by a millimeter, the gold sewing thread shot through Beato's heart...`
`{n}That intense pain was worse than all of the pain before that put together.`
`Beato finally remembered the actual feeling of dying, which she had forgotten over one thousand years...`
`But, .........she couldn't die.`
` She must not die.`
`{n}If she died, the two in the parlor would be handed over to the brutal witch.`
`So she definitely couldn't die.`
`{n}She resolutely...refused to die...!`
`".........New {f:5:Beatrice}...`
` ...I have a request.`
` .........The lover's meeting between the two in the parlor is to be short.`
` .........In the amount of time an hourglass can measure, Kanon will probably disappear to Hades.`
` ...Would you please allow them that much time...?"`
`"No waay.`
` Tearing apart two who love each other is fun, isn't it?`
` You're the one who said it.`
` So I want to try it!"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*...`
` In that case, I cannot allow you to enjoy that pleasure...`
` *cackle*cackle*, it is fun, tearing lovers apart."`
`"Right?`
` I'm sure it must be, right?`
` So don't get in my way!!`
` Sew her more!`
` Sew, sew, sew!!"`
`"Nihi!`
` 410, understood!!"`
`The merciless gold sewing needle sewed its golden thread through Beato's heart over and over again.`
`......However, no matter how much it tightened, that heart did not stop...`
`"Khh......hhhhhhh...this isn't nearly enough...`
` You'll have to do better than this to kill me...!!"`
`"What are you doing?`
` Make this old hag stop talking.`
` Kill her quickly!"`
`"W‐...we are...!!`
` Even though we've sewn her heart in place several times,`
` ......her heart...w‐won't stop...!!"`
`"......Are you...immortal?"`
`"Of course not.`
` ......I've handed the endless over to you.`
` There is a limit to how many more times my heart can beat."`
`"...However, if by making it beat just one time extra, I can give the two in this room even slightly longer to themselves,`
` ......I'll continue that meager resistance for all eternity!!"`
`"Sew!!`
` Keep sewing until her heart stops beating!!"`
`"Guuh, guooooh, gwaa{0}aA{0}A{0}Aaa{0}a{0}aAA{0}A{0}AAa{0}ahhhh!!"`
`"...Wh‐......why doesn't she die?!`
` This is impossible...!!"`
`"Her heart is, ......sewn in place...`
` ......So why...doesn't it stop?!"`
`"Fine then, we'll make the heart explode from the inside nyeh...!`
` How pitiful, and you could have died cleanly if you hadn't resisted us!!"`
`The gold needle and thread made round trips over and over again as they spoke, and still Beato didn't expire...`
`The barbarous witch was at last starting to turn pale at how unnatural this was.`
`"............What in the world......are you...?"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` ......You probably cannot understand.`
` ......Even I didn't understand.`
` ......But still.`
` ...Somehow or another, it seems that this is true magic.`
` .........In other words,`
` ......I have now...`
`...become it.`
` ...I have become...`
`...a true witch!!"`
`"Center of explosion stabilized in heart interior.`
` Primed and ready!"`
`"Detonate!!!"`
`There was a deafening sound, .........and gold leaf and a flutter of gold butterflies were scattered around the area.`
`Beato's chest had...opened wide from the inside,`
` ......and from that, gold butterflies and gold leaf erupted, staining the surrounding area gold...`
`Then, Beato's body crumpled.`
`Like a puppet whose strings had been cut, ...she crumpled and sank down to the floor.`
`......However, in the air, a gold heart tied by gold threads floated, and continued to beat...`
`".........Wh‐.........what the, .........hiiiiii..."`
`"M‐......monster......hiiiiiiiiii...!"`
`When the Chiester Sisters saw that, they fell on their behinds in shock.`
`......Somehow, ......even though Beato had become nothing more than a heart, it still kept beating,`
` continuing to protect the barrier to the parlor.`
`...It was an immeasurably immense magical power.`
`...Impossible to measure.`
` In other words, infinite—and endless.`
`".........I, {i:I'm} the Endless Witch, right...?`
` .........Why is this old hag......still alive......after all of this......?!!"`
`"Chiester Sisters!!`
` Smash that heart!!`
` Quickly!!"`
`"I‐it's impossible, my apologies!`
` We cannot do it!!"`
`"............It is probably impossible.`
` No number of people could crush that heart.`
` ...Much less the likes of the soldiers who serve under His Highness the Dragon King."`
`"In that case,`
` an Endless Witch like me should be able to crush it, right?`
` My power is a god's power!!"`
`"I am afraid to say,`
` that your power...`
`cannot leave a single scratch on {i:{f:7:Beatrice}‐sama's} endless nature."`
`"......Just what...do you mean by that......"`
`"In the same way that there is no light without knowledge of shadows,`
` ......there is also no endless without knowledge of the limited.`
` .........Before Milady {f:5:Beatrice}'s true endless power, your flimsy magical power is very, very lacking."`
`"What is.........that supposed to mean......"`
`"...aah—"`
`The cruel witch stepped back in surprise.`
`It was more transparent than a lace curtain...`
`......but Beato's form—no, {i:{f:7:Beatrice}'s} form—was still standing there.`
`Even after taking on this wretched appearance, ......she would not allow evil through that door.`
`At that time, ......a shadow just as faint as {f:5:Beatrice} stood behind her.`
`It was Kanon.`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` ...Thank you very much.`
` ...I will not forget this favor you have done for me."`
`"......Hmph.`
` ...I shall hear those words again when the number of my favors surpasses the number of grievances I have caused.`
` ......Are you done?"`
`"Yes.`
` .........Truly, thank you very much.`
` ......And {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama,`
` ......you have also...done enough.`
` ......Please,`
` ......be at peace..."`
`"......Is that so...`
` ......So this...is enough......`
` .........ku......*cackle*cackle*cackle*..."`
`"What's going on...?`
` ......Why are you guys calling that predecessor hag {f:5:Beatrice}?!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} is {i:my} name, right?!`
` It should be my name, as the new Golden Witch and Endless Witch, right?!"`
`"............What gall.`
` How dare you assume {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's name."`
`"I am afraid to say...`
`...that the name of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama should be taken by the person who can be crowned as the Endless Witch.`
` By now, the term "predecessor" refers to you.`
` ...Pukkukukukuku."`
`"What......did you say......?"`
`".........Farewell, Kanon.`
` ......I'll meet you soon anyway.`
` In a new nightmare."`
`".........In the nightmare of a new night, I will once again be your companion, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...`
` ......With that, ...if you would excuse me......"`
`Kanon's form grew faint, ......and he disappeared into thin air.`
`After watching him go, ...{f:5:Beatrice}'s form also grew faint, ......and before disappearing, it slumped over onto the floor.`
`Then, ......there was a splat.`
`The golden heart which had been floating in midair...had lost its sparkle, become blood‐stained flesh, and fallen to the ground.`
`...How frail it was.`
`{n}It was ragged and full of holes.`
`...But until just now, it had sparkled so much, and had continued to beat forcefully.`
`That heart still barely managed to beat.`
`......However, it was only a matter of time before it stopped.`
`{f:5:Beatrice}, whose form had become fragile and faint like incense smoke, lay on the floor,`
` ......steadily watching her own heart...`
`There, the cruel witch could be seen...`
`"...H‐...how are {i:you} "{i:endless}"...?`
` Face reality, you're collapsed in a heap on the floor, aren't you?!"`
`"Endlessness with limits...that's a contradiction, it can't possibly exist!`
` This is the limit of your magic!`
` The limited is inferior to the infinite!!"`
`"...................................."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} no longer had the energy even to respond.`
`{n}...No, in fact, it was doubtful whether the words of the cruel witch even reached her ears...`
`"If you're a real Endless Witch, try standing up!!`
` Well?`
` You can't, can you?!`
` Why do you think you can't stand?!`
` It's because you aren't an Endless Witch!!"`
`The merciless witch poked {f:5:Beatrice}'s heart with her fingernail.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} had no words with which to respond to that provocation.`
`......However, ...instead of words, she returned a single expression.`
`{n}......It looked insulting only to the cruel witch.`
`Because she had gently curved her mouth, ......and smiled.`
`......Footsteps were approaching that place.`
`There was no way she could mistake them.`
` ...That boisterous noise of shoes against the ground was the sound of Battler's footsteps...`
`".........Battler, is it.........`
` .........ku, ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*...`
` ...For all my talk, ...I've ended up like this......"`
`"................................."`
`"............I've been trying to become...`
`...the true witch you talked about,`
` .........in my own way......"`
`"...Yeah.`
` ......I was watching."`
`"......Hey,`
` ......have I now...`
`......been able to...`
`...become a witch......?`
` ......Have I earned the qualifications to become...`
`...your opponent......?"`
`"No good."`
`Battler said that unbelievably bluntly.`
`Taking a painful breath, {f:5:Beatrice} saw that, and sneered at herself as though she should have expected it.`
`"............ku, ...*cackle*...`
` ...Is that so.`
` ......It seems I still have an uphill struggle ahead of me on the road to becoming a true witch..."`
`"......However, ...I will not surrender...`
` ......Just like you never surrendered to my torture...`
` .........I will definitely......become a true witch,`
` ......and be...accepted as......your opponent......"`
`"Yeah, it's no good.`
` It's no goddamn good at all.`
` You aren't my opponent."`
`The brutal witch raised her foot high...`
`{n}...Below it was {f:5:Beatrice}'s frail heart.`
`"Die, you old hag!!`
` See if you can show how endless you are after you've been mushed to bits!!`
` I am the witch!`
` I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!!`
` Diiiiiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iieee!!"`
`{e:170:"Yeeeeeahhhh, it's no good, it's no goddamn good at aaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaall!!!"}`
`"Wha‐.........what...`
`...is this......?`
` ...Wh‐.........where am I......?"`
`"Get in your seat.`
` My opponent isn't Beato.`
` .........It's you."`
`"......B‐...Battler...?!`
` What kind of magic is this?!`
` Who cares, it doesn't matter!!`
` Chiester Sisters!!"`
`"45, understood, individual firing!!"`
`"410, understood, die Battler!!"`
`The Chiester Sisters each readied their own golden bows, and fired golden arrows.`
`The two only pulled the bowstring together when using precision guidance.`
`{n}If they were fighting against an enemy before their eyes, they fired their bows at the same time.`
`And the power was no different from what it normally was.`
`"Wha......... I‐i‐it was deflected?!?!`
` There's no barrier, it was deflected with resistance alone...`
` F‐...45, target measurement!!"`
`"45, understood...`
` ............huh, ......whaaaa...?!`
` Th‐this is... ...Am I broken?`
` The measurement is...going berserk......?"`
`"A‐anti‐magic resistance, endless nine...`
` E‐even mythical‐class magical attacks have no effect on the target!!"`
`The warheads of the golden bows could penetrate any magical armor with their mutual corrosion.`
`When attempting to block that using the anti‐magic resistance stat, even something with eight digits wouldn't escape penetration.`
`...Furthermore, even among the famous gods that appear in myths, there are not many who reach a resistance stat of nine digits.`
`For that reason, nine digits were enough to measure almost all imaginable values.`
`...Battler had filled all nine of those digits with 9's......`
`"......How foolish.`
` When Battler‐sama is serious, mere magical arrows cannot even succeed in making his hair tremble."`
`The Chiester Sisters dropped their golden bows in shock...`
`...To this Battler, it felt even less perceptible than two dragonflies passing by his sides.`
`"............What the hell are you guys doing?`
` Are you playing or something?"`
`"...Hiiiiiii...`
` ...M‐......monster......"`
`"If your name's not Eva, get the hell out of here!!`
` And you get in your seat, you goddamn fake witch!!`
` I'll tear that mask of yours off!!!"`
`""H‐...hiiiiiiiiiiiii!!""`
`The Chiester Sisters couldn't hide their fear at Battler's ferocity, and they backed up as though they had been struck.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} watched this scene in shock......`
`"B‐......Battler,`
` ......what......is this supposed to be......?"`
`"Just what you're seeing.`
` My opponent isn't you."`
`"It's her!!`
` The impostor over there, who's assuming your name!!!"`
`"Gh...!"`
`"......I'm fighting against witches.`
` ...And my method of denying them is to make anyone who calls themselves a witch my opponent, and crush them.`
` ......I've seen more than enough of your arrogance."`
`Then, Battler's eyes grew as sharp as blades as he fixed his eyes on the cruel witch.`
`"......Magic, my ass.`
` Witches, my ass!`
` You aren't a witch!!`
` I'll rip that mask off and tear it to shreds!!`
` {f:5:Virgilia}, get ready to fight!!"`
`"Understood.`
` Preparations are complete, so go whenever you're ready.`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` You stay back and rest."`
`"M‐mm......"`
`Beato looked at Battler timidly.`
`{n}...She still hadn't been acknowledged as his opponent.`
`{n}Was she qualified to watch the game board from the sidelines...?`
`"Beato, stay back and watch!!`
` I'll tear it off!!`
` I'll take this fake witch completely apart!!`
` I won't let someone like this call themselves a witch!!`
` You protected the honor of true witches!"`
`"Uh, ...I, umm......"`
`"You don't need to say anything."`
`"On your behalf, I'll teach her that the name of the Golden Witch definitely isn't that cheap!!"`
`".........B‐.........Battler..."`
`"Those are the general rules."`
`"............Thanks, Ronove.`
` I get most of the rules now."`
`"...I see.`
` You can't win with magic, so you came to face off with me in a world where victory is decided by something other than magic."`
`"......Foolish people.`
` You really think you can win against me with twisted logic?!"`
`"Damn right I do.`
` I'll crush all of your twisted logic, Aunt Eva!!"`
`"I, I am not Eva...!!`
` That is the name of the old shell that I shed.`
` I am a true witch, born inside of her...!!"`
`"Don't try to trick me! Your true form isn't a witch or anything like it, but a flesh‐and‐blood human.`
` The human culprit, Ushiromiya Eva!!!`
` {f:5:Virgilia}, reconstruct the second twilight!!"`
`"Understood."`
`"On the second twilight, Rosa and Maria were killed in the rose garden.`
` We make our first move by applying the Eva culprit theory."`
`"Huuh?`
` Riiidiculous!`
` Come, arise, try to remember!`
` What form did Ushiromiya Hideyoshi have?!!"`
`"Whaat?`
` What's this supposed to be?"`
`"......It's summoning of the dead.`
` It is easy for a witch to bring even the dead to the stand for testimony..."`
`An Uncle Hideyoshi who you could see right through was summoned.`
`...Magic sure is convenient.`
`{n}He looked as though he couldn't see what was going on here, almost like a person on the other side of the TV.`
`"Witness summons.`
` Ushiromiya Hideyoshi's testimony.`
` Come, Hideyoshi, speak...!"`
`"......I was takin' care of Eva in the room the whole time.`
` Eva didn't leave the room either, of course."`
`"Aunt Eva.`
` Around here, testimony that isn't red isn't worth crap."`
`"I demand that he repeats it again in red!!"`
`"Oh yeah, that's right.`
` Sure, say it in red for him!"`
`"`
`{p:1:I was in the room the whole time}.`
` {p:1:Both before and after the time period of the crime}."`
`"See, look.`
` This makes it impossible for Eva to be the culprit!`
` How will you counter this?"`
`"Ridiculous.`
` That move's so pathetic, I could yawn.`
` ......Beato never used such childish tricks, not even once."`
`".........Battler..."`
`"Repetition requested!!`
` "Aunt Eva was also in the room the entire time, before and after the time period of the crime"!!"`
`"Uncle Hideyoshi was just there to create an alibi.`
` You made Uncle stay in the room and stealthily snuck out.`
` ......If that isn't true, this guy should be able to say so in red!!!"`
`"D‐decline repetition...!`
` Hideyoshi's testimony is sufficient!!`
` There's no need to repeat that, right?!"`
`"......She's backed down.`
` Mercy is unnecessary.`
` This is check."`
`"Yeah, I'll take it. This opponent is a piece of cake!!"`
`"Check!!`
` Maybe Uncle Hideyoshi didn't leave the room the whole time.`
` But saying he was taking care of you the whole time...is a barefaced lie!"`
`"Therefore, no alibi exists for you!!`
` You had a chance to slip out of the room and kill Auntie Rosa and Maria!`
` If you think you can dodge that, try proclaiming in red that "Auntie Eva didn't take a step outside of the room"!!"`
`"You can't, right?`
` Checkmate!!!"`
`"Wh‐.........what is that......?!`
` I, ......I don't get it...!!"`
`"Sorry, Auntie.`
` ......Even if you aren't used to the rules, beating your opponent down with all your strength is how this game is played.`
` ......Isn't it, Beato?!"`
`"M‐...mm..."`
`"The witch side resigns.`
` Let us continue on to the next game.`
` Next is the fourth twilight through the sixth twilight."`
`It seemed that the witch still didn't understand how to approach things, and was losing her composure in irritation.`
`She was probably also angry that a shot had been taken at her while she still didn't get what was going on.`
`...But I won't go easy on her at all.`
`Just like she didn't go easy on the victims at all, I won't go the slightest bit easy on her...!!`
`"{f:5:Virgilia}, next crime!`
` Let's reconstruct the incident with Dad and the rest!!"`
`"Understood."`
`"Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi: these three people went to the mansion, and were killed there."`
`"My move won't change.`
` Aunt Eva, {i:you} are the culprit!!"`
`"This time, you don't even have an alibi from Uncle Hideyoshi!!`
` You claim that you were sleeping in that room all by yourself.`
` But that is untrue!!!`
` If you can proclaim it in red, just try it!!"`
`"......I refuse.`
` ...So tell me then!`
` Eva is just a woman.`
` And the people who were killed were three adults holding two guns, right?"`
`"How did she kill them all by herself?`
` How did she do it with those stakes as weapons?`
` How is this stake‐shooting device that everyone keeps talking about constructed?!"`
`"Explain that!!`
` As long as you can't explain it, even if Eva doesn't have an alibi,`
` it doesn't mean that it was possible for Eva to commit murder!"`
`"Decline explanation!!`
` It's a "Devil's Proof"!`
` You can't refute the existence of an unknown murder technique or an unknown weapon just because it's impossible to explain!!"`
`"In short!!`
` Even if I can't explain how the stake‐shooting device is constructed, that doesn't disprove its existence!!"`
`"Wh‐what is that?!!`
` Is that madness allowed?!"`
`"......‘Devil's Proof’, valid."`
`"Agreed.`
` "Devil's Proof", valid.`
` ......Battler‐kun can claim that a stake‐shooting device exists without bearing the responsibility of explaining how it is constructed.`
` The witch side cannot object to this move."`
`"......N‐not bad...`
` How pushy..."`
`"Heh!`
` Well, there's this ill‐natured witch who trained me well.`
` This is check, got it?!`
` Try saying in red that Auntie Eva didn't take a step out of that room!!"`
`"That's right, there's no way you'll be able to say it!`
` If you can't say it, it's over, checkmate!!"`
`"......Th‐......that's so irrational.........!`
` This is...messed up...!"`
`"Those are the rules of this game.`
` ...How about some black tea first?`
` We also have some delicious cookies, you know."`
`"I don't need all that!!`
` Oh, that pisses me off...!`
` So you fight like a coward just because you can't win with magic...!!"`
`"Don't get irritated.`
` Drink some black tea or something.`
` I'll take mine straight.`
` What about you, Beato?"`
`"I, ...I am fine...`
` .........More importantly, Battler, don't let your guard down.`
` Your opponent is merely unfamiliar with the rules.`
` ...It will start in earnest once your opponent gets the feel for it..."`
`"But I'll crush her.`
` I'll thoroughly crush her.`
` That's because she isn't a witch."`
`"If I accept her as a witch, ......all of your stubbornness counts for nothing!`
` I don't care what kind of irrational argument or twisted logic I have to use,`
` I'll crush her with all of my heart and soul!!"`
`Battler's side then stuck with the "Eva culprit theory" to explain Krauss and Natsuhi,`
` the seventh and eighth twilights, in the exact same way.`
`At that time, there had been no one on the first floor of the guesthouse except for Eva and the victims.`
` ...As before, no one could establish an alibi for Eva.`
`At the time, Eva had claimed that they had disappeared while she was in the lavatory,`
` but nothing supported that, and the witch side couldn't repeat that in red either.`
`With the same argument as she had used to ask about the construction of the shooting machine,`
` the witch side asked once more how Eva could have strangled both of them at the same time all by herself,`
` but of course, Battler splendidly counterattacked by refusing to explain because of the "Devil's Proof".`
`Under the storm and stress of Battler's spirit, the witch side was completely swallowed up,`
` and was forced to resign three times during the short period of time she had to grasp the rules...`
`".........Kuhhihihihihyahhyahhhya...`
` Hah, I see!`
` I'm finally starting to get the knack of it.`
` I won't let things go the way you want them to any more!"`
`"This time, let me take the initiative.`
` Ronove, reconstruct the fourth through the sixth twilights!`
` Pick out Ushiromiya Kyrie!`
` ......For now, let me return to the murders of Rudolf, Kyrie and Hideyoshi for the fourth through sixth twilights."`
`"......Wh‐...what is she thinking?`
` Why would she return once more to a board state she has already resigned from?"`
`"I see...`
` ...This is a rare attack, which you do not use.`
` Be careful."`
`"At the time, the survivors were barricaded in the guesthouse.`
` They didn't have food, but out of concern for their safety, they were at least prepared to go without eating until the next day.`
` ......However, in the end, three of them went out for food."`
`".........That's right.`
` In the end, three people went outside to get food."`
`"I'll add in some red as I speak, 'cause it'll be a pain otherwise.`
` {p:1:Kyrie didn't think that they needed food}.`
` Since going without food for about a day wouldn't kill them,`
` {p:1:she claimed that they should not leave the guesthouse}."`
`"And yet, she herself...`
`{p:1:suggested that they leave the guesthouse to get food}.`
` .........Isn't this a contradiction?"`
`"Yes, a spectacular contradiction.`
` It contradicts Kyrie's pattern of behavior."`
`"That contradiction...`
`{i:was created by me, using magic}!`
` In other words, I controlled Kyrie using magic, and made her say that to lure the sacrifices outside!!"`
`"R‐ridiculous!`
` There's no way that kind of magic exists!!"`
`"It's a "Devil's Proof", though!`
` Just because you don't know about that magic doesn't disprove its existence!`
` And I don't bear the responsibility of acting out that magic for you.`
` And yet, you still have no room to counter this argument!!"`
`".........*giggle*giggle*!`
` I wonder if it's alright to fight this way."`
`"Yes.`
` It is truly a spectacular move.`
` ......Battler‐sama, your response, if you please."`
`"You sure have brought in a weird argument.`
` ...Run that by me again?"`
`"She has made a play against Ushiromiya Kyrie's pattern of behavior.`
` ...As has already been explained,`
` Kyrie's pattern of behavior had her saying that they should not go outside and head to the mansion in order to get food."`
`"Yet, even so, she took the initiative,`
` and took the contradictory action of suggesting going to get food.`
` As long as you cannot explain this contradiction, this violent move claims that it was due to magic."`
`"...Well, Kyrie‐san probably thought that too in the beginning."`
`"But she probably, uh, ...thought about various things midway,`
` and had a change of heart, deciding that food really was necessary...`
` It would be a problem if, due to hunger, we had no energy when we most needed it...and, well..."`
`"......She is claiming that this change of heart is due to magic.`
` In short, ...while it might be extremely difficult, you must explain the reason for Kyrie's change of heart."`
`"Wh‐......what...?`
` ...But that's asking me what was inside Kyrie‐san's own head..."`
`"Can't I also summon Kyrie‐san's ghost and question her or something?!`
` Beato!`
` Can't you call Kyrie‐san here or something?!"`
`"She cannot.`
` That is a move permitted only to the witch side."`
`"S‐......sorry..."`
`"......Aaaaaaahhh, damn it!!`
` She was probably, umm, ......thinking of us kids and, umm, ...on the whole, thought that food really was necessary and..."`
`"You must make that claim objectively.`
` ...You require tangible evidence of the specific reason for which Kyrie changed her mind and decided that food really was necessary.`
` ......For example, if someone heard her say that, or if it was written down somewhere."`
`"Too bad,`
` {p:1:no reason for her changing her mind was ever told to anyone, nor was one ever written down}!`
` Therefore, you can only speculate as to what was inside Kyrie's mind!"`
`"So it is impossible to prove!!`
` You don't have a single counter to my move!`
` It's your turn to resign now, Battler‐kuuun...!!"`
`"......It is possible to hypothesize endlessly as to the reason behind her change of heart.`
` And, it is impossible to crush all of those endless possibilities."`
`"A detestably spectacular move.`
` .........If Battler‐sama were to have a method of countering, ...it could probably only be that move."`
`"Wh‐......what move is that...?"`
`"......Well now.`
` I wonder what kind of move it could be.`
` I have the feeling that it was Milady's specialty, but I cannot remember."`
`"..................kh...`
` Quit being stingy and tell me...!"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` There is no answer that will be given to those who stop thinking themselves.`
` ...Think.`
` Think in your own way!"`
`"Why don't you resign right now?`
` And I'll corner you even more with red.`
` {p:1:Until the last instant before she died, Kyrie maintained her pattern of behavior which states ‘I won't go to the mansion to get food’}!"`
`"And yet, she took the initiative and headed for the mansion.`
` She was pushing a cart, trying to carry food.`
` Why that contradiction?`
` ......Because I controlled her with magic!!!`
` This is the proof that my magic exists, and that I am a witch!!"`
`"...............Shut your damn mouth...!!"`
`"A‐...are you saying that she never even changed her mind?!`
` ......The whole time until she died, Kyrie‐san thought "we don't need food", "I won't go to the mansion"?`
` Then why did she step forward herself and say that they should go to get food, and go to the mansion...?!!"`
`"Are you saying that Kyrie‐san was being controlled with magic?!`
` That's stupid...!!`
` How, ...how am I meant to break through this magic?!"`
`"...If only Kyrie‐san were here, and just told us the reason behind her change of heart...`
` No, I've already been told in red that she never even changed her mind...!`
` What should I do...?!!`
` There's no move that the human side can counter with!!"`
`"The more I learn about this game, the more advantageous the rules seem for the witch, don't they?`
` Even if the witch loses in a lot of areas, if she can win in just one, with that alone she can flaunt her existence."`
`"......In other words, Battler‐kun, you have no way of denying witches other than a complete victory!"`
`"You called me Eva all those times and seemed to be under the impression that you'd been cornering me,`
` but it's all been turned over by nothing more than the inside of your respected Kyrie‐san's head, don't you think that's truly funny?!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!`
` Just do it, resign!!`
` Why don't you just accept it forever?`
` Why don't you just lose forever?!"`
`".........Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiit...`
` It's impossible for a human to show...`
` I can't do anything but guess what the dead were thinking when they acted.`
` Furthermore, I can't deny magic just by conjecture.`
` ...To break through magic, I need objective evidence as to why Kyrie‐san had a change of heart..."`
`"......But damn it,`
` it's been said in red that no evidence exists as to why she started wanting food...`
` ......What should I do, damn it, damn it...!!!"`
`".........Battler‐sama.`
` May I take it that...you resign?"`
`"...........................kh.........`
` "I won't go to the mansion to get food".`
` But how should I understand Kyrie‐san's thoughts, which actually do contradict......?!"`
`"You can't understand!!`
` It's impossible to understand, and impossible to interpret!!`
` That darkness is all of the witch!"`
`"Come on, it's useless to think, so quit, alright?!`
` There's no way you can deny witches!`
` I mean, look at me, {i:I exist}."`
`"I am the Golden Witch!!`
` I stole that name from that former witch over there!!`
` You can't deny that I am {f:5:Beatrice}!!!"`
`"Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit...!!!`
` You have no right to say that name...!`
` ......And yet, ......I can't think of a move to deny that.........!!!"`
`Battler could no longer counter this witch who was laughing derisively in triumph...`
`He didn't want to give up, but he could do nothing.`
`He ground his teeth, making fists with both hands.`
`{n}......But even so, he couldn't think of a brilliant counterattack...!`
`"Battler‐sama.`
` ......You are closing in on the time limit—will you resign......?"`
`"Kh......aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh......!!!"`
`".........The human side has no move in response.`
` We will res—"`
`"Wait!`
` ......Th‐there is......a counterattack."`
`"Wh‐......what did you say...?"`
`"Huh?!`
` What kind of move can you possibly have, Predecessor‐sama?!`
` Care to tell me what kind of move can deny my magic, the magic of {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` You can't, it's impossible!!"`
`"......If the proposition "I won't go to the mansion to get food" cannot be explained by itself,`
` ......I will explain it with the contrapositive.`
` In short, you may also be able to explain it with "she did go to the mansion, therefore there was a goal other than food"."`
`"......R‐rather than my specialty "Hempel's Raven", ......this is Battler's specialty, "chessboard thinking"."`
`"......If it is impossible for Kyrie to have gone to the mansion with food as a goal,`
` we can only explain it with another goal which caused Kyrie to go outside in any case.`
` In other words, if we can establish that goal, we can defeat magic...!"`
`"I, I see...`
` So she didn't go to the mansion with food as a goal, but had a different goal,`
` and said that she wanted to go and get food in order to disguise her real goal..."`
`"......Y‐...yeah, if that's the case, it may still be possible to explain it.`
` ......But......how?!"`
`"Master, reconstruct the scene where Kyrie died...!`
` We cannot summon a ghost, but inspecting the corpse should be the human side's right..."`
`"Yes, that poses no problems.`
` I will reconstruct the scene where Ushiromiya Kyrie died."`
`"We cannot call Kyrie's ghost here,`
` but by learning what Kyrie left behind, we may be able to use that as a weapon."`
`"Ha, hahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Fine, search as much as you want!!"`
`"There's no way you'll learn anything!`
` I just said it in red a short while ago.`
` {p:1:Kyrie did not leave anything written down}!`
` No matter what you find, how could you understand anything!!"`
`".........We may find nothing...`
` ......But, ......Battler is grinding his teeth, fighting to think of a move to break through you.`
` .........This is all that I can do......"`
`Beato landed on her feet in the reconstructed hall,`
` approached Kyrie's fallen body, and wandered around observing.`
`"I, I don't quite understand the process of how the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} side fights...`
` .........Evidence was required, was it...?`
` ......Then what should I search for?"`
`"The purported Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice} is getting down on her knees and crawling around!`
` And she's even disgracefully searching a corpse?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*, how that look suits you...!!"`
`"...Say what you wish...`
` ......I cannot do any more than this...`
` ......I do not care how I am mocked..."`
`".........However, I cannot abandon Battler, as he is fighting for my honor...`
` ......Even if I must crawl on the ground and search through dead flesh,`
` ......I must answer to that responsibility..."`
`While being subjected to the witch's sneers, Beato searched through Kyrie's corpse.`
`{n}......She fished through the pockets, taking out what was inside and laying it on the floor...`
`Laid on the floor,`
` ......was a handkerchief,`
` tissue,`
` a key to her house,`
` the stub of a plane ticket,`
` a lighter,`
` a cigarette butt,`
` and a single hundred‐yen coin...`
`There was no special, suspicious object...`
` Although Beato was down on all fours and being sneered at, that was all she could find.`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` What's with that wretched looking trash?!`
` Come on then, how are you gonna break through my magic with that stuff?!"`
`"Worthless, worthless, you look so duuuumb!!`
` What's with this state of affairs after you butted in sounding all heroic?!`
` Aaah, how pathetic, how embarrassing!!`
` Why don't you just give up and die forever?!"`
`The witch fell over laughing, taunting Beato.`
`{n}...Beato hung her head, trying to withstand this shame.`
`"...Milady,`
` are you satisfied with your inspection?"`
`".........M‐......mm...`
` ...I......will not find any more than this..."`
`"From this evidence, can some move be made to counter?`
` If not, then the human side must resign."`
`".....................khhh........."`
`"Obviously! You don't have any room to argue back!!`
` I am a witch.`
` You can't break through my magic!!"`
`"You're no longer anything but a former witch.`
` Just a loser who isn't even allowed to take the name {f:5:Beatrice} anymore!!`
` Go on, pile up as much trash and rubbish as you like, and try to break my magic with it!!"`
`"...You can't, right?`
` You can't, can you?`
` Kuhhihihihihi, and why's that?`
` It's because I'm a witch.`
` ...It's because you're just a loser without a name!!`
` Kuhhi{0}hhyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah!!!"`
`".........Something, ............something should be here......`
` .........I won't lose heart...`
` ......I will not lose heart......`
` No matter how much I am sneered at......Battler is fighting for my honor,`
` ......so for the sake of his honor, ...I must not lose heart........."`
`As Beato held back tears at the words of humiliation she was being showered with,`
` in the hope that Kyrie was holding something else, ......in the hope that she could find something that could save Battler from his plight,`
` ......she searched earnestly.`
`...However, nothing more came up......`
`"...............Damn it all......`
` ......Please, ......Ushiromiya Kyrie......`
` I know you will save your son from his plight......`
` .........Please, ......even after death, lend me power for his sake......"`
`However, Kyrie's body did not answer.`
`{n}......It was only natural that a corpse would remain silent.`
`No dead person existed that would answer Beato, now that she had lost the Endless Magic...`
`"It's pointless, pointless pointle~ssss.`
` Toying with the dead is a privilege only for witches.`
` For you, who is neither a witch nor even a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, no one exists who will lend a hand!!"`
`"You will be alone for all eternity!!`
` You have no witch or {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} allies, and no one will save you!!`
` If that frustrates you, why don't you cry forever?!`
` Why don't you apologize, say "I'm sorry I'm so useless" forever?!`
` Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"...............Sorry, ...Battler.........`
` ...I......couldn't help you...in any way......"`
`"..............................`
` ......No, you've done enough.`
` ......Thanks, Beato.`
` I won't waste your efforts..."`
`"I, I don't need consoling...!`
` Just how could you argue back with this pile of rubbish...?!!`
` Just how could you strike back with this rubbish I endured her sneering to scrape together...?!"`
`In front of Beato, who was still crawling on all fours and hitting the pile of objects Kyrie had left behind with her fist, Battler also crouched.`
`And, ......after patting her on the shoulder in thanks,`
` ......he moved that hand to the ground, picked up the cigarette butt, and held it up over his head.`
`".........What are you trying to say with that trash...?"`
`"Kyrie‐san doesn't smoke."`
`But Kyrie was even holding a lighter.`
`Certainly, she wasn't carrying a box of cigarettes itself,`
` but at a glance, it very naturally looked as though Kyrie had a smoking habit...`
`"...Dad smoked, but Kyrie‐san didn't.`
` ...But she did walk around with just a lighter to light Dad's cigarettes."`
`"Ha!`
` So what?`
` If the husband smoked, then even if the wife didn't, it isn't strange for her to have a cigarette on her."`
`"Maybe she just picked up her husband's irresponsibly tossed cigarette butt?`
` What are you trying to say?`
` What does this have to do with my magic?`
` Nothing at all!!!"`
`"I'll say more.`
` ...This is a different brand of cigarette than Dad smokes.`
` ......Sorry, Beato,`
` could you look in the pockets of Dad's body too?"`
`"..................M‐...mm.`
` ......This...?"`
`"......Checking the brand.`
` The brand is different from the cigarette butt.`
` ...The cigarette butt Kyrie had on her is not of the same brand as the cigarettes that Rudolf smokes."`
`"And so what?`
` Maybe Kyrie is just a good girl who likes things to be clean, so she couldn't leave a fallen cigarette butt alone and picked it up?`
` I wouldn't though!!"`
`"......Beato, sorry, but one more time please.`
` ...Uncle Hideyoshi's pockets.`
` .........In this family, only Dad and Uncle Hideyoshi smoke cigarettes."`
`"I‐......it's here...!`
` Is this it......?"`
`Beato found a cigarette box in Hideyoshi's pocket, took a single one out, and held it out.`
`"......Checking the brand.`
` We acknowledge that the cigarette butt is of the same brand that Hideyoshi smokes."`
`"L‐like I said, so what?!!`
` How can you break my magic because you found Hideyoshi's cigarette butt in Kyrie's pocket?!?!!!!"`
`"...............That's right.`
` This cigarette butt is our message from Kyrie‐san.`
` No, ......this cigarette butt itself is the reason that Kyrie‐san left the guesthouse."`
`"Beato, thank you.`
` ......If you hadn't found this, I would have given up here."`
`"............{f:5:Virgilia}!!`
` Reconstruct the situation!`
` The guesthouse after it came to light that Auntie Rosa and Maria had been killed on the second twilight!!"`
`"Understood."`
`"Reconstructing.`
` ......After Rosa and Maria's deaths, the remaining survivors rechecked all of the doors and windows in the mansion.`
` They constructed a barricade.`
` They rechecked that their defenses were solid."`
`"There's nothing suspicious about that at all.`
` What are you trying to say?`
` Why are you bringing back the second twilight when we're talking about the fourth twilight and after...?!"`
`"Dad carried a portable cigarette butt holder with him.`
` I can finally see why Kyrie‐san deliberately put that cigarette butt in her own pocket."`
`"............It was because that cigarette butt meant something.`
` That very cigarette butt was the message left by Kyrie‐san for us...!!"`
`"L‐let's hear it, then!!`
` How, using a single cigarette butt,`
` are you going to deny me?!!"`
`"......As you've just heard,`
` after the second twilight, an inspection was done for all the rooms in the guesthouse.`
` .........At that time, Kyrie‐san found something that shouldn't exist, in a place where it shouldn't be."`
`"S‐......something that shouldn't exist...?`
` ......What do you mean by that?"`
`"It's this.`
` This cigarette butt.`
` This had been set in the ashtray of the guest room where Uncle Hideyoshi had been."`
`"Huuuh?!?!`
` What's wrong with there being a cigarette butt in an ashtray?!!`
` Are you sure there isn't something wrong with your head?!"`
`"Aunt Eva hated smoking!!`
` There's no way that there would be a cigarette butt there when she was sick and sleeping!!!"`
`"However, there was a cigarette butt in the ashtray.`
` When she saw that, Kyrie‐san realized immediately.`
` ......Uncle Hideyoshi was lying.`
` She realized that Aunt Eva hadn't really been sleeping,`
` ...and that she had snuck out of the room!!"`
`"Repetition requested!!`
` "This cigarette butt was stubbed out in the ashtray of a room in which Uncle Hideyoshi {i:and} Aunt Eva were resting!""`
`".........I, ......I refuse...!"`
`"I've finally got it.........`
` Thank you, Beato."`
`"W‐`
`......was I...`
`...of some...`
`use...?"`
`"Yeah, you were!!`
` We'll tear it off, we'll tear the mask off of the fake witch!!!"`
`From that cigarette butt, Kyrie realized that Hideyoshi was creating an alibi for Eva's sake.`
`Hideyoshi had been tasked with watching over the room to create an alibi,`
` ...and during that time, he had been unable to withstand the tension and had smoked.`
`Then Kyrie had disclosed that to Rudolf.`
`{n}She disclosed that there was a good chance that Eva was the culprit, and Hideyoshi was an accomplice.`
`".........Next, Kyrie‐san proposed that they go to get food.`
` And then she asked Uncle Hideyoshi to lend a hand!!`
` This could only mean one thing."`
`"Kyrie‐san planned to isolate Uncle Hideyoshi and question him about the truth!!"`
`"‘Hempel's Raven’, valid.`
` Unless the witch side can counterattack this move, the existence of the magic which claims to have controlled Kyrie is denied."`
`"Wh‐what did you saaaaaaaaaaaayy?!?!`
` I, I deny it, anyway, I deny it...!!`
` It wasn't me, no, wait,`
` it wasn't Ushiromiya Eva, Eva was sleeping in the room!!!"`
`"Then try saying it.`
` You can't and I know it!`
` You can't say it this time either!!"`
`"Repetition requested!!`
` "At that time, Ushiromiya Eva did not take a step outside the room"!!"`
`"What the hell is thiiiiiiiis?!`
` {i:I'm} the one who was attacking, right?!`
` Why did I get on the side that's being attacked?!`
` When did offense and defense get reversed?!"`
`"I'm the one doing the questioning, you know?!`
` The witch, me, whyyyyyyyyyy!!!"`
`"I repeat!!!!`
` Repetition requested!!`
` "Ushiromiya Eva did not leave the room"!!`
` There's no way you can say it,`
` it's CHECKMAA{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}AATE!!"`
`"Does the witch side have a move in response?"`
`"......There cannot be one.`
` There is no truth that can be accepted from a false witch dressed up with truths and falsehoods."`
`"You aren't qualified to call yourself a real witch!!`
` You aren't the Golden Witch!`
` You are a human!"`
`"You are Ushiromiya Evaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`"OOOAAAOOOOOOOOOooooOOOOOOoooooohhhhhhhh!!"`
`The witch roared.`
` Her entire body was burned with a tremendous heat that denied her own witchcraft and existence, and she let out a roar like a dragon...`
`Her body flickered repeatedly,`
` flashing as Eva's figure and the witch's figure overlapped.`
`However, the roar drowned out that flicker, ...and made it return once more to the original form of the cruelhearted witch.`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ...kuhhihha{0}hha{0}ha{0}hahaha...`
` ...Alright.`
` ...If you want to call me Ushiromiya Eva, then go right ahead..."`
`"......I admit it, I really can't repulse all moves related to Ushiromiya Eva being the culprit.`
` ......I may have been dragged down from the position of Golden Witch,`
` ...and maybe I am now being called Ushiromiya Eva..."`
`"......But you know what? That by itself doesn't mean that witches and magic are denied!!`
` ...I'll teach you now..."`
`"I'll teach you that I am not Ushiromiya Eva, nor a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human},`
` ......but a real witch...!!!`
` Look and see this red truth!!"`
`The witch clapped her hands, and time advanced in the world of the game board.`
`As they called Jessica's name, Battler and Eva ran up to the parlor.`
`...They were searching for Jessica because they had gone to the servant room, found Nanjo's corpse, and didn't know where Jessica was.`
`".........So what's your point?`
` ......What are you trying to say?"`
`"Y‐.........you couldn't be...`
` ......Oh no......"`
`Beato went pale.`
` ...That made it clear that the move the evil witch was about to make was bad enough to have such an effect on Beato...`
`"This time,`
` ......I'll give you a fatal move that you won't be able to talk yourself out of.`
` ...No, I'll make this move against all {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s who support you.`
` Prepare yourself and listen...to my move."`
`"D‐......don't... That move is.........!"`
`"Beato, stay back...!!`
` I'll take it!`
` Bring it on, you fake witch!!"`
`"`
`{p:1:After Jessica was injured,}`
` {p:1:Eva was constantly under Battler's supervision}.`
` {p:1:Battler is neither the culprit nor an accomplice}.`
` {p:1:By this, we can establish a perfect alibi for Eva}."`
`"Wh‐......whaat...............?"`
`"I'll seal you,`
` and {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s as well,`
` ......in a red barrier of death that most certainly cannot be escaped from.`
` Farewell, lowly {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.`
` Sleep for all eternity in an absolute locked room of magic with no exits.`
` ......Now, prepare yourself.`
` For the red truth."`
`{p:1:There are no more than 18 humans on this island}.`
`Throw away your foolish thoughts of mysterious people hiding and committing crimes.`
`...But if I say it this way, you could also suspect animal culprits.`
` It would be unbearable to hear an irrational theory about how an orangutan trained to commit murder wouldn't count as a human.`
`So, I'll change it like this.`
`{p:1:No life forms other than humans have any connection to this game}.`
`So, with that covered,`
` next, I'll explain the situation for all 18 people who exist on this island.`
`{p:1:Kinzo is dead}.`
` {p:1:Krauss is dead}.`
`{p:1:Natsuhi is dead}.`
` {p:1:Hideyoshi is dead}.`
`{p:1:George is dead}.`
` {p:1:Rudolf is dead}.`
`{p:1:Kyrie is dead}.`
` {p:1:Rosa is dead}.`
`{p:1:Maria is dead}.`
` {p:1:Genji is dead}.`
`{p:1:Shannon is dead}.`
` {p:1:Kanon is dead}.`
`{p:1:Gohda is dead}.`
` {p:1:Kumasawa is dead}.`
`{p:1:Nanjo is dead}.`
`Those 15 are all dead.`
`And.`
`{p:1:Battler is alive}.`
`{p:1:Eva is alive}.`
`{p:1:Jessica is alive}.`
`That's everyone, all 18 of them!`
`"So you understand that, accordingly, when the last victim, Nanjo, died,`
` only three people, Battler, Eva, and Jessica, were alive, right?"`
`".........Wh‐......what did you say...?`
` ......Y‐......you bitch, ...you couldn't mean............"`
`"`
`{p:1:Eva was with you the whole time}.`
` {p:1:So committing a crime was impossible for her}.`
` {p:1:Of course, Battler‐kun isn't the culprit}.`
` {p:1:He wasn't forging an alibi for her, and he took the possibility that she was the culprit into account, watching over her actions carefully}."`
`"`
`{p:1:No chance existed for her to do anything suspicious}!`
` {p:1:In short, at the time of the crime, only Nanjo and Jessica were in the servant room}."`
`"......And I know what you're thinking.`
` Your next move will be this, right?`
` There's also a chance that Jessica is the culprit!`
` But too bad, I'll slice it up in red before you try!!"`
`"`
`{p:1:Ushiromiya Jessica has not committed murder}!`
` {p:1:She was not involved with Nanjo's murder}!!`
` {p:1:Her eyes were completely blocked}.`
` {p:1:It's impossible for her to carry out a murder like that}!"`
`"And here's an extra.`
` {p:1:Neither Eva nor Battler killed Nanjo, nor were they involved}!!"`
`"W‐wait a fucking second!!`
` That makes no goddamn sense!!`
` There are only three humans, then a murder occurs, ......and none of those three were involved? That's insane!!"`
`"I'll state it clearly.`
` {p:1:The culprit who killed Nanjo was neither Battler nor Eva nor Jessica}!!`
` In other words, it wasn't one of the survivors.`
` Get iiit?"`
`"No, umm, .........th‐that's right!`
` What about multiple personalities...?!`
` Just like you were originally another personality of Auntie Eva's,`
` ......let's say Jessica had another, witch‐like personality,`
` which took the name of "someone other than Jessica" and killed Doctor Nanjo...!!"`
`"Moron.`
` I've already said it in red.`
` {p:1:Jessica's eyes were completely blocked, and murder was impossible for her}!"`
`"No matter what kind of personality she was possessed by, murder could not be carried out with her body!`
` I wonder if you'll be satisfied if I say it this way?"`
`"{p:1:No actions caused by Jessica's body had any relation to or influence on the murder of Nanjo}!`
` {p:1:This also applies to Battler and Eva}.`
` In other words, no matter how much you try to struggle and interpret it,`
` {p:1:neither Jessica nor Battler nor Eva is the culprit who killed Nanjo}!"`
`"Y‐...you've got to be kidding me!!!`
` I mean, everyone else is dead for sure, right?!!"`
`"Then......all that's left......is the Doctor Nanjo suicide theory, right?!`
` And the trap theory!`
` The culprit was already dead, but a trap that they had already prepared went off..."`
`"{p:1:Nanjo's death was a homicide}.`
` ...{p:1:Of course, it was with a direct method of murder, not a trap}.`
` {p:1:They readied their weapon, and killed him with it directly from the front at point‐blank range}!`
` {p:1:The culprit appeared openly before Nanjo's eyes, and as they both looked at each other's faces, the culprit killed him}...!!"`
`"But wait!!`
` There are only three survivors!`
` You said in red that everyone else is dead!`
` You basically confirmed the life or death status of all 18 people.`
` Furthermore, the existence of a 19th person has already been denied in red...!!"`
`"In other words, no one can exist except the three survivors!!`
` And yet, a fourth person other than those three appeared before Doctor Nanjo!!`
` How can a person other than us appear and murder Doctor Nanjo when no 19th person exists?!?!"`
`"Insane!!`
` You're lying!!`
` You're lying with the red letters!!!"`
`"{p:1:The red only tells the truth}!!!`
` Isn't doubting that the same as betraying the honor of that witch who's behind you, shriveling up in fear of me and hiding behind your back?!"`
`"D‐.........damn it............!!!"`
`"I'll state it clearly,`
` right now.`
` ......The one who appeared in front of Nanjo was me.`
` A witch.`
` ......The Golden Witch, who can't be explained by the 18 humans!!"`
`"{f:5:V‐Virgilia}!`
` Ronove...!!`
` Isn't the situation contradicting itself?!`
` Is she really telling the truth with red?!"`
`"......Yes.`
` "Red truth", valid."`
`"............What an......elaborate and precise cornering......"`
`"H‐......how should I make a move against this...?`
` {f:5:Virgilia}...!`
` Isn't there any move......?!"`
`"..................I...cannot think of anything..."`
`"...And you, Ronove?!"`
`"........................`
` .........My apologies.`
` ......However, in these last thousand years,`
` ...I have never seen......such an elaborately beautiful game board layout."`
`"............Although it pains me to admit it,`
` ............it is beautiful.........`
` ......What a...`
`...beautiful red...`
`...checkmate..............."`
`The witch's master and the demon butler were both stunned, ...and a somehow rapturous expression rose to their faces...`
`.........Forget surrendering,`
` ...they were simply impressed at this perfect checkmate,`
` ...which could only be admired...`
`When people accept defeat from the bottom of their heart...`
`{n}it gives rise to neither regret nor humiliation.`
`{n}......Nothing is born except feelings of respect...`
`I.........no longer knew......what was what anymore.`
`There were absolutely no weak points in her red.`
`She had said in red that all 15 people had died.`
`{n}She had said in red that no people existed other than the 18.`
`In other words, no more than three people—me, Jessica, and Auntie Eva—existed.`
`And even though none of those three people were the culprit, Doctor Nanjo was killed.`
`And without a doubt, Doctor Nanjo's death was a homicide, murdered by "that person" openly from the front...!`
`And she claims "that person"......is a witch.........?!!`
`"The culprit that killed Nanjo was not an animal or anything of the sort.`
` That has already been dealt with in red, you know?`
` Remove everything other than humans from consideration entirely.`
` And no stuff like robots, either."`
`"{p:1:Absolutely no factors other than humans participate in this game board}!`
` Therefore, I can also say this:"`
`"{p:1:The one who killed Nanjo was definitely a human}!"`
`"{p:1:A human, with their feet on the ground, held up a weapon and killed with it}!`
` {p:1:Right before his eyes}!`
` However, the human may have been able to use magic.`
` ......Which means, it was a witch."`
`"......That is, in other words, me.`
` The Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!"`
`......Even as Battler...`
`ground his teeth...`
`......his knees hit the floor with a thunk.`
`His soul still refused to submit...`
`......However, ...his knees had already...`
`...started to accept submission......`
`"Kuhhihhihihihihihihihihi!`
` Oh, did you kneel...?"`
`"That's right, you're already starting to understand.`
` ......The Golden Witch does exist.`
` .........And that Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, is me...!!"`
`"Come on, praise me.`
` Now is the time to praise the resurrection of a true witch.`
` Now is the time to praise the resurrection of the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive......!!!"`
`"Daaamn iiiiiiiitt.........`
` ......I don't......understand......!`
` After...being so thoroughly immobilized by the red,`
` ......I don't......have a clue anymore......!"`
`"B‐......Battler......`
` D‐don't lose heart......`
` ...You and I...promised that we would fight each other again, did we not......?`
` Will you surrender here...?!`
` Will you disappear in a place like this before fighting with me again......?!"`
`"I don't want to break that promise......`
` ............But......I can't think of any move to deny her...!!"`
`"In the first place, ...this isn't even a proper problem!`
` Nothing exists outside the suspects, and all of the suspects are innocent!`
` I've been told that they're innocent in red!`
` And also that it was a real homicide, and that the culprit was human, and that they did appear in front of Doctor Nanjo's eyes and kill him!`
` I give up... There's nothing I can do...!!!"`
`"Please, Battler, don't give up, don't lose heart......!`
` ......If you stop thinking, it automatically becomes your loss.`
` ...I'm begging you, don't lose heart...`
` ......I'm also cheering you on, ......so don't lose......!"`
`"I can't think of anything anymore...!!`
` I end up thinking that she's just a witch anyway, and must have done it with magic, so just thinking is pointless...!"`
`"It's no good, my head hurts, my brain's tired...`
` I end up thinking that thinking's pointless, so I should just stop...!!"`
`"Battler, listen...`
` .........In the game of chess, both sides do all they can to make the other lose, so a single game takes a long period of time.`
` ......However, if one side throws away victory from the beginning, and voluntarily makes moves harmful to themselves, the game will end in the blink of an eye.`
` ......That is called a fool's mate."`
`A fool's mate is, simply put, a strange way of playing chess, with the mind to lose as soon as possible.`
`...Opening the area in front of your own king and inviting the opponent's queen in.`
`Chess, in which the average playing time for a single game may stretch for several hours, can be resolved in a scant four moves.`
`......In other words, if both sides try to win in a fight, they are compelled to take a painfully long period of time,`
` ...but if one side decides to lose, they can end the game all too easily, at any time...`
`"......When the human side stops thinking, it hands the problem before its eyes over to the witch,`
` and even an apple falling from a tree can be immediately resolved as the work of magic."`
`".........And it is the same way for the witch side.`
` ...Witches use the red truth.`
` ......If they use that to show that the true form of magic can be explained away using humans, they can immediately lose."`
`"............You don't have to tell me that...`
` ......You're telling me not to stop thinking, right...?`
` But,`
` .........how am I meant to counterattack her perfect bright‐red move...?`
` For me,`
` ......for humans,`
` .........it's no longer possible............"`
`".........Is it...`
`......impossible...?`
` ......Is it...`
`...impossible for you, Battler......?`
` ......Please... Don't lose heart........."`
`"..................Sorry.........`
` ...It's no longer...`
`......possible for me........."`
`Battler scratched at the floor, crying heavily.`
`......Beato watched that with a distressed face...`
`Then she stood up, and spoke to the witch.`
`"............I will make a move as a counterattack to yours."`
`"Huh?`
` How can you possibly cut up this perfect checkmate?"`
`"How can this checkmate, which is completely impossible for {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s to break,`
` possibly be broken by the likes of you?!"`
`".........{f:5:B‐Beatrice}, you couldn't be..."`
`"Mm.`
` ...What about a move that a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} cannot make.`
` ......I will counterattack you with a move I can use because I am a witch..."`
`"A move you can use because you are a witch......?`
` ......Wh‐...what are you planning to do...?"`
`"I will use the red...`
`to deny witches."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}...!!"`
`"M‐Milady...!!"`
`The master and the butler were both startled.`
`......I also immediately understood what it meant.`
`{n}To use the red that only witches could use.`
`{n}...{i:To use the red to deny witches}.`
`It was like using her own sword to slit her own throat.`
`"Wh‐............whaaat...?!`
` C‐......come on, what are you saying?`
` Deny witches with red...?`
` .........D‐...don't talk like an idiot.`
` If you do that, ...you won't get away unscathed either......!!"`
`".........You are not a witch.`
` And I am not a witch either.`
` ...The road to becoming a true witch is difficult, and I have much, much farther to go..."`
`".........Then that is convenient.`
` In this place now, witches did not exist from the beginning.`
` I will strip this deception away myself."`
`"You and I both are real, obvious witches!!`
` Being able to use red is itself proof that we are!"`
`"I don't know what the definition of a witch is to you,`
` but if you're mistakenly thinking that you alone will be able to get away unscathed, then you'd better—"`
`"I am making no such mistake.`
` I would accept it."`
`"Wh.........at did you say......?"`
`"I never managed to become a witch in the first place.`
` ......I have done nothing more than finally begin walking on the road to becoming a true witch."`
`"...If it is true that I am a witch as I stand,`
` ...then I am nothing more than a false witch who got addicted to power, like you."`
`"......Rather than existing in that shabby form,`
` I would have no regrets...`
`in erasing this form of mine along with you...!"`
`"A‐...are you insane?!?!`
` S‐stop it...!`
` I still want to be a witch! I don't wanna be {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}...!!"`
`".........Witch, please return to your seat.`
` Please, receive the human side's response from your seat."`
`"Wh‐what are you doing?!`
` L‐let go of me!!`
` Don't let that woman use red!!`
` Make her stop!!`
` Let gooooooooooooooooooo!!"`
`As the witch stood from her seat and tried to spring upon Beato, Ronove pressed down on both of her shoulders, forcing her back into her seat.`
`And, even after that, he didn't remove his hands from those shoulders.`
`Denying witches was the same thing as denying magic.`
`......That included demons such as Ronove.`
`However, instead of running away, Ronove chose to act as the facilitator for the game,`
` ...and to carry out that duty for his master's sake.`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` .........You have...no regrets, I hope."`
`"The same to you."`
`"......Sorry.`
` ......Even though you taught me a lot of fun magic and happy spells,`
` .........I couldn't use it well at all.`
` ............So I'll train from zero,`
` ...and start over again.`
` ...I am truly sorry.........that you had to get caught up in your stupid disciple's misconduct."`
`"......I had a good disciple in the very end.`
` ......Go, and do as you believe."`
`".........I, I don't have a clue what you guys are talking about..."`
`"...But I do understand one thing.`
` And I can say this...`
` ......Beato, I don't know what you're trying to do,`
` ...but whatever it is you're about to do, don't do it...!"`
`"You have no moves.`
` But I have one."`
`"......If we let this move escape us, she will be revived as a witch in the true sense, and this time, she will control this whole island.`
` ...All nightmares will be hers to do with as she pleases,`
` and this island will fall into the deepest hell of the evil witch's constant fantasies, for all eternity."`
`".........Can you permit that?`
` ...Is it alright for your dear relatives to be toyed with for all eternity in that witch's nightmare?"`
`"S‐still, ......{i:you} shouldn't have to sacrifice yourself...`
` Th‐this is a game between me and her.`
` There's no need for you to sacrifice yourself to make a move!`
` I, I'll think of something!`
` I'll definitely think of a miracle move...!!"`
`"So don't rush into it!!`
` Ooooooooooooooohhhh, damn it to hellllllllllll,`
` I'll definitely think of one, ......so don't rush into iiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`".........This game is cruel.`
` The time limit for your deliberation has already run out.`
` .........I am now the only one who can do it."`
`"...Worry not, Battler.`
` .........I'll defeat her.`
` ......I'll defeat that cruelhearted witch with my own hands..."`
`"W‐wait, Beato!!`
` Stop it, quit it!!`
` There's absolutely no need for you to sacrifice yourself!!"`
`"Last I remember, you were fighting to deny me.`
` ......What a strange person.`
` Hahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha."`
`"......Let that child do as she likes.`
` And please, see her through."`
`"B‐...but......"`
`"Battler.`
` ......There's only one thing I ask.`
` ......Would you...cover your ears?"`
`"My ears......?`
` Why...?"`
`".........In a few moments, I will deny witches in red.`
` I will slice up the game board that she has laid out with her red."`
`"......By doing that,`
` .........I will probably lose my form as a witch as well.`
` ......If you also hear the red truth I will tell, you will understand my true form."`
`".........Even if you alone cover your ears, the truth will not change at all.`
` ......However,`
` ...even so, I want you alone to cover your ears.`
` ..................I at least want to be a witch...in your eyes.`
` ......Please."`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` ...There is no problem on the witch side.`
` Please, your move."`
`"Let gooooooooooooooooooo!!`
` You won't get away unharmed either, you know?!"`
`"She's insane!!`
` She plans on dying and taking us with her!`
` Stop it, don't deny it!!"`
`"Stooooooppppppppppppp!!!"`
`"...How unsightly for a Golden Witch.`
` .........Now, are you ready?"`
`"...I will remove your checkmate in Battler's stead.`
` What happened on the chessboard where fifteen died, and only three remained?`
` ...I will now expose it in red.`
` With that red truth, ......I will impale and kill both fake witches!"`
`Beato turned around and smiled at Battler.`
`......Most likely, no one would believe that the witch who had gone to the limits of cruelty...`
`would try to leave a smile as the last expression she showed Battler.`
`And that smile signified her last wish, that she wanted him to cover his ears...`
`Denying witches in red......was the same as knowing her shabby form.`
`Battler put both of his hands against his ears...`
`......To protect her final...`
`honor as a witch, he put his hands against his ears, ...rejecting the truth.`
`And he howled.`
` So that not even a bit of what she was saying would slip into his ears.`
`After that...was a world where Battler could not hear anything.`
`{n}Beato was saying something with red.`
`Even the evil witch attempted to cover her ears at their bitter contents.`
`......That was...the red truth.`
` Words of power.`
`{n}......Words that denied her own existence.`
`Words that only witches could use—the only words capable of denying witches.`
`Beato talked.`
`{n}With the red truth, she sliced apart the bright‐red game board that the witch had released.`
`She explained difficult problems that could not be solved by humans, with moves that could only be solved by witches, and began cornering the witch.`
`The {i:truth} that Battler was not permitted to hear.`
`If Battler had broken his promise, and sneakily listened in...`
`{n}......in an instant, Battler would probably have been able to become the victor in his game with Beato.`
`......He would probably have understood all the riddles on the island, all of the magic and tricks, locked rooms, spells, curses, legends,`
` ...and the entire tale of anger and sadness.`
`However, ......Battler would only learn what that was when he reached the truth by himself.`
`Yes.`
` ...From the beginning, ......{f:5:Beatrice} had wished that Battler would reach that truth by himself.`
`It was something that shouldn't be reached by being told.`
`{n}It was a truth that Battler would have to drag himself to with his own power.`
`A brilliant light gathered with Beato and the evil witch at the center, and grew gradually stronger...`
`It was...the power of truth.`
`.........A heat and brilliance like the sun...`
`shone on all of the falsehoods that hid in the darkness, trying to deceive, ...and burnt them to nothing.`
`"GWOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAaaaAAaaAAAaaaahhhh!!`
` How?!`
` How can you die?!`
` How can you throw away your life...when you have such incredible power?!`
` You hold the power to control gold, magic, and everything else at will—`
`how can you so readily throw that away?!"`
`"......Learn that even with a mountain of gold,`
` even with magic to split the sea,`
` there are some things you can never obtain.`
` .........Come, show yourself.`
` Show your true form, ......Ushiromiya Eva!!!"`
`When the sun exploded and blew everything away...`
`{n}......Eva could be seen there, holding a gun.`
`"Y‐.........you are the culprit...`
` Aunt Eva......!!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*......ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!`
` Took you long enough to notice, Battler‐{i:kun}!!"`
`Without any hesitation or mercy, Eva raised the gun and pulled the trigger.`
`...An explosion resounded, and Battler fell to the floor, his heart shot through.`
`After going into convulsions for a short time,`
` ...with blood dripping from his mouth,`
` ...Battler died...`
`But in his last moments, ...he understood without a doubt that she was a murderer.`
` And not just for killing him...`
`.........There are several murders where I don't have a clue how they were carried out.`
`However, ......while my ears were covered,`
` ......Beato exposed all of them with the red, blasting away all magic.`
`...In other words, .........even though I didn't understand it,`
` ......hadn't that been nothing more or less than proof that all magic can be explained with humans?`
`.........Beato made me cover my ears.`
`{n}...So I myself don't know the whole truth.`
`...However, .........from the fact that she managed to deny it in red,`
` I learned one fact which is extremely unfair for us......namely, "it is possible to deny all magic".`
`So, in other words, .....................`
`......No,`
` ......I must not think of that.`
`.........If I do, ...then the time I covered my ears would be made pointless.`
`If I'm going to regret, I can only regret my own actions.`
` ...If, at that time, I had thought of some turnabout move to counter the witch's final play,`
` there would have been no need for Beato to sacrifice herself.`
`I......brought about this conclusion......because I was worthless...`
`...Even though it was a pitch‐black world where nothing could be seen,`
` ......for some reason, I felt Beato's presence right next to me.`
`......So I tried calling out to her.`
`{n}...You can exchange words with someone whether they're a human or a witch.`
`......So even in a world where witches have been denied......I should be allowed to talk to her...`
`"...............Beato......"`
`"......Battler, is it...`
` ...............It is done.`
` ......I...did it."`
`"...Yeah.`
` ......I didn't hear it,`
` .........but I watched you...until the very end...`
` I was watching......as you boldly stood up to that evil witch..."`
`".........With this, ...I am no longer a witch.`
` ............But, I will definitely...become a witch again...`
` ......And...`
`...I will make it so that I can be called the Golden Witch again,`
` .........and then,`
` ......when I am ready to be accepted as your opponent,`
` .........I will return once more......"`
`"No.`
` .........You...were a witch."`
`"...............Huh......?"`
`"...I...was watching.`
` .........When you took that evil witch,`
` ......and blew her away with that awesome magic, exposing her true form,`
` ...I was watching with my own eyes..."`
`"Th‐...that wasn't magic,`
` ......but the red—"`
`"No, it was magic.`
` .........You were definitely...the Golden Witch.`
` .........Even if you deny it yourself,`
` .........I'll accept it.`
` ............‘You are definitely...`
`the Golden Witch’."`
`.........When Battler said those words...`
`In the world that had been dark, ...there was suddenly a single grain.`
`...A small grain of gold, like a wheat seed, shone brightly.`
`{n}...Even though it was small, it had a strong, gold‐colored glow.`
`And......it illuminated the two of them, sitting with their backs together...`
`So they each became aware of their own form.`
`...They did not exist only as consciousness.`
`......They became aware that they had bodies, and definitely existed.`
`...No, maybe we should say that they each had been given an existence called a body.`
`When Battler looked at his own form, he wasn't that surprised.`
`...But when Beato looked at her own form, she was a little startled.`
`......From Battler's perspective, she looked just like normal,`
` ......but for a short while, she was surprised by that form...`
`".........What............`
`......is going on.........?"`
`"The glow from that grain of light......is getting stronger and stronger..."`
`That grain of wheat was no longer simply gold‐colored, but was like the light of the sun.`
`Then, it softly.........began to approach Beato's chest.`
`When that grain of the sun......was sucked inside her chest...`
`......the world became wrapped in a deep blue sky, and then a deep blue ocean spread out below them.`
`An island rose up, trees sprouted and created a forest, walls surrounded us and a ceiling swallowed us.`
`And it became adorned with more and more things,`
` ......until we realized that this was the hall in the Ushiromiya mansion.`
`In that fantastical hall where many gold butterflies beat their wings,`
` ...many tables were set up with white tablecloths, like it was a party,`
` and beautiful cooking and fruits were set out.`
`...And over there......were a great many figures.`
`{n}Everyone was there, talking together and smiling.`
`"G‐............guys........."`
`There was Dad and Kyrie‐san, Uncle Krauss, Aunt Natsuhi and Auntie Rosa, and of course, even Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi.`
`......George‐aniki, Jessica, Maria, ...wait, wait, even Shannon‐chan, Kanon‐kun, Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san are here.`
`Everyone, everyone was at the party, clapping their hands and celebrating our return...`
`"Wh‐...why...?`
` Everyone was dead...!`
` Why are they alive...?!"`
`"......In the Golden Land, all the dead people's souls can be revived.`
` ......Welcome back, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` And welcome, Battler‐kun.`
` Welcome to the Golden Land."`
`"............I...made it?`
` ...I made it...`
`to the door of the Golden Land?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......Milady, you have finally been able to invite everyone to the Golden Land.`
` ...Welcome, Battler‐sama, to the Golden Land."`
`"Battler.`
` .........So, you have finally made it this far."`
`"G‐Grandfather...`
` .........Where in the world...am I..."`
`"...My blood, which is...incompatible with magic, runs more deeply in your veins than any other.`
` ...Therefore, you were the only one who could not reach the Golden Land, and {f:5:Beatrice} has been searching for you ever since.`
` ...She tried everything to bring you here."`
`"............What did you say......?"`
`"It seems that we are all here at last."`
`"Battler‐sama, if you would take your seat.`
` Tonight's dinner is my very best work.`
` If you would, please relish it."`
`"You should be honored!!`
` Normally, I would have eaten all of it, but I left you guys some out of pity!"`
`"......The seven stake babes..."`
`"In the Golden Land, all of those with minds are equal.`
` ......Here, there is no distinction between us furniture, {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, or witches."`
`"...Battler‐sama.`
` We were waiting for you.`
` And welcome to the Golden Land..."`
`"Shannon‐chan, ......George‐aniki...!!"`
`"......I'm still suspecting that this might be a dream...`
` I'm sure that we died.`
` ......But, ...we're alive.`
` And everyone, every one of us is here, ......and we're all happy.`
` ...I can't believe it."`
`"That's right, this place must be a dream worrld!`
` So it doesn't matter that George is so friendly with a maid girl, it has to be a dreeeam!`
` Waaaaaah!"`
`"Give it a rest, Eva.`
` For now, you gotta stay quiet and bless the two young 'uns.`
` The Golden Land is a capital of bliss.`
` We should never quarrel here...!"`
`"Here, any people are free to love each other.`
` ...No one needs to hesitate over it."`
`"Jessica‐chan, Kanon‐kun, so wonderfuul!`
` I'm so jealouuus!"`
`"......H‐hey, Battler...`
` This is kinda, umm, wahahahaha..."`
`"Battler‐sama, welcome.`
` And welcome home..."`
`Jessica was probably embarrassed because she was holding hands with Kanon‐kun.`
`And Kanon‐kun wanted to act humbly like a servant and bow,`
` but since neither of them could let go of the other's hand, he couldn't do it so well, and the whole scene looked fairly comical.`
`"With a servant child...?!!`
` I forbid it, I couldn't possibly give away our Jessica to such a person...!!"`
`"Why not allow it?`
` Let her at least choose the person she likes."`
`"I forbid it, I forbid it, aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaahhh, Jessicaaaaaaaaa!"`
`"Mine has gone awry toooooo, ohhhhh, Geooooooooorge!"`
`...As Aunt Natsuhi and Auntie Eva hugged each other, they cried tears of regret for their darling children.`
`......Even though they had always been at odds.`
` ...It was a very bizarre scene.`
`"......It isn't really a problem, right?`
` It doesn't matter who likes who."`
`"Exactly.`
` It's proof the parent hasn't let go of their child."`
`"Battleer,`
` you can bring home whatever kind of woman you want, I'll accept her waaarmly, alright?"`
`"You can't introduce her to this guy, you know?`
` He'll get his hands on her immediately.`
` He'll elope right away."`
`"............Battler.`
` You finally came here.`
` Kihhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi."`
`"Maria...`
` .........From the beginning,`
` .........you knew that we would be coming here......?"`
`"Uu!`
` That's why I wasn't scared at all.`
` Everyone was a fraidy‐cat.`
` It was funny!"`
`"......What the hell.`
` ...Even though I thought you were the most screwed up,`
` ...you actually knew the truth from the beginning."`
`"H‐how rude...!`
` It is absolutely unforgivable to speak of Lady {f:5:Maria} in that way!"`
`"Forming firing curve, attack preparations ready.`
` Lady {f:5:Maria}, we can attack at any time.`
` Nihi!"`
`"Kihhihihihihihihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi...!`
` Ouch!"`
`"...Quiet.`
` You are in the presence of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"Well, there's no need to be quite so strict.`
` For now, let us take their desire to fool around and play together into consideration.`
` More importantly, why don't we begin preparing for the toast?"`
`"Yes, I have finished preparing my excellent mackerel cooking.`
` I can serve it at any time."`
`"Hey!! Ladies!`
` Work a little more like furniture!!"`
`"Nooooo!!`
` I wanna stuff myself some mooore!`
` Wahhhhhhh!"`
`"Come on, let's work.`
` Don't keep the guests waiting.`
` Let's work studiously and attend to them.`
` Don't let the guests do anything.`
` Make them lazy, make them slothful, fatten them like pigs.`
` Ahhahaha!"`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Battler‐kun.`
` This way."`
`Grandfather and {f:5:Virgilia} were standing on the landing at the top of the staircase, beckoning us.`
`Beato and I looked at each other quizzically, then climbed the stairs together.`
`From the hall, it looked like a very high stage.`
`A small table had been set up there, as well as a piece of parchment and an old‐fashioned quill pen.`
`I saw that strange magical characters and Japanese were written side by side.`
`{n}...And below it, many names were written.`
`There were 17 of them.`
` ......Grandfather was the first, and everyone else's names had been signed below in one long column.`
`The people who arrived at the Golden Land probably signed this one after another.`
`"Battler.`
` Now that you are here, everyone is gathered.`
` Listen carefully."`
`"The Golden Land is not a world supported by the power of magic alone.`
` The cooperation and approval of all humans who receive happiness here is required.`
` For that sake, we must gather the signatures of everyone here."`
`"Last time,`
` the door to the Golden Land was finally opened, but you refused to sign.`
` ......Although you probably don't remember it.`
` Because you refused to sign, this world was once again sealed in darkness."`
`"......Just hearing it like that, ...it kinda sounds like I've been the only stubborn one,`
` and I've been causing everyone all kinds of trouble..."`
`"That is because you are a certified hardhead.`
` It seems that you inherited more than just blood from Kinzo."`
`Beato laughed amiably.`
` I knew I was being made fun of, but that smile led me to go along with her, and I laughed without thinking.`
`"Magic is a miracle.`
` ......Miracles cannot be completed unless everyone believes.`
` ......And when you do, as the last to do so, this miracle—the Golden Land—will be completed."`
`"..................It looks like I've been a real pain.`
` ...So, what should I do...?"`
`"First, sign here.`
` Then, {f:5:Beatrice}, sign here."`
`"......It's hard to use a quill pen.`
` ...Whoa, it shot."`
`"You klutz.`
` Shooting ink is a bad omen.`
` Can't you at least write your name quickly?`
` In that illegible scrawl.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"And what about you...!`
` Don't write it in {c:86EF9C:{ruby:katakana:capitals}} like that!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} is a stylish name, so write it in cursive!`
` You're making the quill and your name cry!"`
`"Sh‐shut up, in school, didn't they tell you not to use cursive on tests?"`
`"This is a solemn ceremony. Be silent."`
`"Very good.`
` We have gathered the two signatures, as well as the form for the covenant.`
` ......Both of you, your oath please.`
` We'll start with {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Put your hand on the covenant, and take the oath."`
`"......‘I, {f:5:Beatrice}, as a good witch, swear to continue with my training for the sake of bringing happiness to the people’.`
` ...Say it."`
`"......M‐......mm...`
` ......I‐it's a little embarrassing."`
`"......I, B‐{f:5:Beatrice}, as a good witch,`
` swear to continue with my training for the sake of bringing happiness to the people.`
` ......Is that alright?"`
`"Good.`
` Battler is next."`
`"In the same way, Battler‐kun.`
` Put your hand on the covenant, and take the oath.`
` ......‘I, Ushiromiya Battler, as a member of the Golden Land, swear to serve for the sake of bringing happiness to myself and my neighbor’."`
`"Ah,`
` ...I, Ushiromiya Battler,`
` as a member of the Golden Land, swear to serve for the sake of bringing happiness to myself and my neighbor.`
` ......I'm embarrassed too..."`
`"Hear me, one and all...!!`
` Here and now, we have gathered the oaths of all 18 humans accepting the Golden Land...!!"`
`When Kinzo proclaimed that, everyone applauded at once, praising us.`
`......Since I'd been the only stubborn one and had just been a nuisance, I felt a little bad about being the most celebrated one.`
`"And with that, in accordance with the ancient rites, we ask Battler‐kun, the last to make the oath, to sign the invitation to the Golden Land.`
` ......This is something that invites the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, to the Golden Land.`
` The Golden Land invites the Golden Witch through a consensus of those who have accepted it, and becomes complete."`
`"Battler, I will read it out loud.`
` Listen carefully.`
` ............‘The 18 of us acknowledge the Golden Witch to be {f:5:Beatrice}, and welcome her to the Golden Land’."`
`"What's going on with you? You won't be invited unless I send an invitation?"`
`"It seems that is the ceremony.`
` It makes me uncomfortable also.`
` Why don't we end it quickly?`
` I've been so hungry for a while now."`
`"......Come to think of it, I've only been pecking at canned food and haven't eaten anything good.`
` Let's get this thing signed and be done with it."`
`"Let's see here.`
` "We accept you as a witch".`
` .........Huh?`
` That's pretty simple.`
` Damn you, Grandfather, exaggerating how it actually says it."`
`"Come on, come on, quickly."`
`"Sign, right here."`
`"............huh...?"`
`"Quickly."`
`"Sign."`
`......With slightly weird and uncomfortable smiles, the two of them started demanding that I sign...`
`At that time, an incredible sound like that of a glass window breaking reverberated through the hall,`
` and the bustling tumult melted back into complete silence.`
`I dropped the quill pen and turned around, trying to see what had happened.`
`When I did,`
` ...............where had she come from?`
`...A human who clearly hadn't been there a short while ago was in the very center of the hall, ...looking up at us.`
`Who's that......?`
` ......A woman?`
`{n}She's probably about the same age as Jessica and me.`
`......But I didn't know that face.`
`{n}None of the other people here knew that face either.`
`"......Wh‐......who are you?!`
` Who is this?!`
` Where did you come from?!`
` Those without invitations are not needed in my party.`
` Servants, throw her out!!"`
`"As you command!!`
` Surround her!!"`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory surrounded her from seven directions, taking out magic blades that drew purple trails and blocking her.`
`And from out of nowhere, shuffling goat‐head servants appeared in great numbers, surrounding that woman.`
`On top of that, the Chiester Sisters stood in front of Beato like a wall, readying a golden bow and pulling back the bowstring...`
`"......................................."`
`But the woman didn't move at all.`
`...On the contrary, she was still staring at us on the landing, not paying them the slightest bit of attention.`
`......Who is she looking at...?`
` Beato?`
` Grandfather?`
`............It couldn't be......me.........?`
`Yes.`
` ...The woman was staring straight into my eyes, ...glaring.`
`{n}Then, after our eyes met perfectly, she yelled.`
`"You must not sign that!!!`
` Are you going to accept your own defeat?!`
` Don't be tricked by the witch!!!"`
`"......Huh?`
` By the witch,`
` ......huh?!"`
`Just then, something incredibly strong lifted me by the nape of my neck.`
`...Wh‐what's going on...?!`
`And after I was forced to turn around,`
` ......I saw {f:5:Virgilia} with an eerie smile on her face, and the muscular forms of goat monsters...`
`A goat monster that looked like it was two meters tall was holding me up with an arm as thick as a log...!`
`"Hohhohohohohohohohohohoho...`
` There is no need to listen to an uninvited guest.`
` Come, give your signature as well.`
` On this written oath.`
` "Ushiromiya Battler accepts the existence of witches".`
` Come now, sign the written oath...!!"`
`"Ow, ...owowowowowowowowowowowow!!`
` D‐damn it, let go!!!"`
`As the goat monsters constricted me with the power of a vise, they forced me to grab the quill pen.`
`...I couldn't even touch the floor with my feet, much less resist...!`
`"Battleer, why are you resistiiiing?`
` Weren't you just about to sign willinglyyy...?`
` Don't change your mind now, after all that, alriiiight?"`
`"Didn't you think for an instant, ...that it might be alright to accept witches?`
` You thought that, riiiiiight?`
` Kukki{0}ki{0}ki{0}kka{0}kka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}kakaka!!"`
`"............I,`
` ......I was...`
`...tr‐`
`...tricked......?`
` That can't be.........`
` You aren't that kind of—"`
`".............................."`
`"......Hi......hihhihahhahhahaaaHAAaHAHHH!!"`
`"Sorrrrry, Battleerrr, I am that kind of persooooooooooon!!`
` Aah, it's no good, I can't keep this up, it looks like sentimental sob stories don't match well with meeeeeeeeeee!!`
` Master, with all your strength, if you please!!`
` That was such a plain role to play, and I got so bored!"`
`"I don't know who you are, woman!!`
` But I'll beat you to death, mash you and crush you until threads start trailing, got iii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiit?!`
` I'll make you regret being born a womaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaan,`
` hyahhaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaahh!!"`
`Beato raised her gold pipe high,`
` and the massive chandelier hanging in the hall crackled with electricity, and from that fell an almighty purple thunderbolt...!`
`It was a direct hit on the woman right below it, and should have turned her to ash.`
`However, ......not a single hair was singed.`
`"Hoh...!!`
` I see you have what it takes to show up uninvited...!!`
` Tell me! Say your name!!"`
`"I don't have any name to tell {i:you}.`
` .........More importantly."`
`"......You idiot!!!`
` How long are you going to be tricked?!!`
` Stop being so naive and trusting!!`
` Figure it out already!!`
` All this, all of this is the witch's trap!!"`
`Those words were aimed at me.`
`......This is all...`
`...the witch's trap, she says...?`
`That can't be...`
`{n}Beato reformed and swore to become a good witch......`
`".....................Beato...............`
` ...Calling it a trap...`
`...is a lie, right......?`
` Please.........tell me it's a lie......"`
`"......Sorry, Battleer.`
` It was pretty interesting."`
`"...Still, I was just trying to do what Master told me, but it really did work very well!"`
`"I hear, after acting {ruby:tsuntsun:bad‐tempered} and exploring the depths of cruelty, if you act properly incompetent and {ruby:dere:soft}, you can get a massive rise on that goodwill meter thing, riiight?"`
`"I've heard that villains who go {ruby:dere:soft} and then {ruby:yan:crazy} are pretty popular these daaaays...!`
` Despite how I loook, I've studied a lot of manga, anime, and {c:86EF9C:galge} that have been popular recently, you seeee?"`
`"And I tried it out, and just as expected, it was "tears please", and you're down!!"`
`"Hihhyahhahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha, idioooot, what a truly simple person!!`
` They call this the "North Wind and the Sun Strategy".`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"......How could............`
` ............D‐`
`............damn you......`
` You two‐faced bitch......`
` How dare you deceive me like this...!!"`
`"...................................."`
`"......Yes, that expression fits you the most.`
` That caring expression of yours really doesn't match me after all.`
` My back was itching, and I was frantically trying to withstand it.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"Too baaad, wiiiitches...don't reforrrm{p:0:☆}"`
`"Hyaahhahhahhahhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!!`
` You take care of the signature, Master!`
` This uninvited guest is my prey!!"`
`"Come, you can no longer refuse to sign.`
` ......Now, come on.`
` Sign it and offer your body, your mind, and your soul...!!"`
`When {f:5:Virgilia} lifted her chin as a signal, the goat monsters, with an even more vise‐like power,`
` forced my arm to approach the parchment......!`
`Owowowow... These guys are trying to make me sign, even if it breaks my arm......`
`At that moment, a bright red light burst open with me at the center, knocking the witches and the goat monsters away.`
`Did that woman save me......?!`
`{n}B‐but who in the world is that? I don't have a clue!`
`"How long do you plan to keep playing in a place like this...?`
` Enough already.`
` I'm jealous of you."`
`"............I, I'm glad you saved me, but that's a pretty cruel way to say it.`
` ...Sorry, but who are you...?"`
`".....................`
` ...............Witch of Rokkenjima!!`
` It's time you gave him back!!"`
`"Kuhhahahahahahahahah!!`
` Who would do that, you fool!!`
` Battler is my toy.`
` My favorite toy, the best toy in the world...!!"`
`"I won't get tired of him, I won't throw him away, I won't hand him over to anyone!!`
` Even Battler is enjoying this to the fullest.`
` Together with me, he is having so much fun playing.`
` No matter who you are, I won't let you interfere...!!"`
`"Oh yeah, it really does look like you're living it up here, I'm so jealous my blood is boiling!!`
` In a wonderful place like this, guffawing and having a lively, fun, noisy blast of a time with everyone!"`
`"Surrounded by lots of eye‐candy witches and being pampered all the time,`
` I'm sure you're having so much fun, you don't even want to come back!!"`
`"......A‐...are you talking to me...?`
` Wait wait, you've got the wrong idea...!`
` This is a pain for me too!`
` The hell is fun about this, you don't know a damn thing about my troubles...!"`
`"What troubles?!!!`
` You get to have fun living with Mom and Dad, you get to play around happily with all of the cousins,`
` you get to play with pleasant witches as long as you want for all eternity!"`
`"Don't you realize the happiness you have?!`
` I'm jealous of all of you, don't you get it?!`
` I'd love to be part of all this!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` I'm sorry, but no.`
` I am satisfied with the toys I have.`
` A rude toy like you is not fitting for my toy box!"`
`"Yes, I'm aware of that.`
` Who would ever play with someone like you?`
` ......But I will thank you a bit.`
` ......For bringing everyone together like this."`
`"......Who...`
`......are you...`
` .....................You can't be—"`
`"......I see, so that's it...`
` .........Yes, I get it, I know who you are!`
` ...I see,`
` so {i:you} are the piece Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} threw in.`
` I like it!!"`
`"Why don't I formally invite you to my party?!!`
` I'll welcome you fully...!!`
` Along with Battler, I'll play with you nicely, break you, kill you, crush you, turn you to ash, mix you with bread dough and bake you until you're fluffy!!`
` Fuhha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaahh!!"`
`".........Ohhhh, that's no good, no good at all!`
` You'll never be able to do that!`
` Rokkenjima, in the year 1986.`
` ...I will expose everything that happened then to the light of day!"`
`"I'll teach you that you're no more than needle ice, scared of the spring of truth!`
` Prepare yourself, Golden Witch!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}!!!"`
`"Hahahaha, wahahahaha!`
` I never thought that Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}'s piece would barge in at the very end...!"`
`"......I searched all over the place for a piece fitting for a game with you.`
` ......I'm sure that you'll grow to enjoy her."`
`"What's with that piece?!`
` Who was that person, who was it?!`
` She didn't say her name! That's not fair!!`
` Hey, don't you think so too?!"`
`"...I have a general idea.`
` ......Come on, normally, anyone would know."`
`"Normally?!`
` No we wouldn't, it was that character's first appearance, wasn't it?!`
` If she doesn't say her name, I won't—the players won't—everyone won't know, right?!"`
`"............Beato, it's alright if you don't tell her.`
` See?`
` Isn't she a funny kid?"`
`"M‐...mm.`
` ......Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s simple‐minded naiveté truly is precious and funny.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Why, why, why I am the only one you won't tell, you meanie!!`
` Okay, in exchange, I'll teach you a special secret that only I know!`
` So tell me!"`
`"......Hoh.`
` A special secret, you say!`
` Now that, I do want to hear...!"`
`"Blehhh!`
` If you want me to tell you, first tell me who that woman really was!`
` The secret I know sure is awesome!`
` I mean, it's gonna blow you away like finding out that Santa‐san is actually Daddy!"`
`"Huh?`
` *giggle*!`
` Oopsie{p:0:☆} Sorry, I'll bet you're so shocked that your world turned upside‐down, right?!`
` Oh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!"`
`".........Your father was the one who came to your place, Lambda?"`
`"To my place... Wait, what's that supposed to mean?"`
`"...Lord {f:5:Santa Claus} only visits the homes of children with clean hearts.`
` He didn't come to your place, then?"`
`"Well, Lord {f:5:Santa Claus} is gracious.`
` Unless you are a reeeally bad scoundrel, he will give you a present.`
` After all, he even gave them to me!"`
`".........As you grow and your heart becomes hardened, he stops coming, doesn't he?`
` How old were you, Beato, when he stopped coming?"`
`"Mm.`
` He stopped coming when I was about twelve.`
` My maiden's heart awoke, and I quickly got somewhat embarrassed about Lord {f:5:Santa} coming."`
`"After I wrote "Thanks for everything, that's enough.`
` So make sure you splurge on the last presents", he stopped coming.`
` Oooh, and I was looking forward to it too!`
` How old were you when he stopped coming, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}?"`
`".........I was pretty wild.`
` ...It happened fairly early.`
` I think when I was about nine.`
` ...Something about that beard really irritated me, so I waited in my futon with some sewing scissors ready, thinking I'd cut it off.`
` ............What a cringeworthy age."`
`"So, ......Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, as long as you can remember, Lord {f:5:Santa Claus} has never come to see you, you say.`
` ............He usually comes until the last year of elementary school or during middle school."`
`"...Maybe we should have a doctor look at her.`
` I hear that maturing too fast can have an adverse effect on the growth of mind and body.`
` ...Yeah, there's definitely some of those.`
` ...Adverse effects."`
`"Hey, wh‐what are you guys talking about!!`
` Gaaaaah!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Wahahahaha, it truly is boisterous when three witches gather!"`
`"......If you're talking about that level of secret, I doubt it's worth listening to.`
` Can I go now?`
` I have to prepare for the next game."`
`"Wha—hey, wait a sec!`
` Tell me who that woman really was!!"`
`"......Well then, tell me this special secret of yours first.`
` If it's good enough, then I'll tell you."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!!`
` Alright, I'll tell you, and it really is a special secret, okay?!`
` ......Remember, in this game, there was a girl who found the gold and became the new witch, right?"`
`"Mm.`
` Just what kind of secret could that person have?"`
`"Ehheheheheh!`
` I realized who that girl actually is.`
` Does anyone know?`
` *giggle*giggle*!`
` There was a hint in the way she talked."`
`"Remember, that girl said it a lot, right?`
` "Why don't you something foreverrrr?",`
` right?!`
` Yes, that phrase was the main point!`
` Foreverrrr?`
` For Evaaaa?`
` Yes!"`
`"She was actually...Ushiromiya Eva!!`
` What do you think?!`
` Are you shocked?!`
` Oh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!!"`
`"Hoh...!`
` I did not notice that!`
` ...Mngh, to think that there would be a hint in a place like that."`
`"......You're good at playing along with her, Beato.`
` This kid can get a little full of herself, so don't take it too far.`
` See you, I'm leaving."`
`"Wait, wait!`
` It's not fair if you just listen to my secret and don't tell me yours!!`
` Tell me who she really was!!"`
`"......Your secret was so incredible that mine just wouldn't match up.`
` ...So in exchange, I'll tell you my own special secret.`
` I'll tell you the name of the culprit in this game called {i:Higurashi no Naku Koro ni}."`
`"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, don't tell meee!!`
` I'm playing it right nowwww!!"`
`"......Ahhahahahahhahhahhahhah...`
` See you, Beato.`
` The black tea was delicious.`
` Oh, about the crackers, though, the repertoire of jam was lacking.`
` Get some gochujang chili paste every once in a while.`
` It goes great with Russian tea.`
` Later."`
`"I see. Alright.`
` I shall try it.`
` I shall call for you when the preparations are finished for the next game.`
` Until then, feel free to draw up a strategy at your leisure."`
`"Yes, I will.`
` This last game was pretty interesting.`
` Later."`
`"Heyyy, wait a sec, tell meee!!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` My, my, you two really are close."`
`"..............................`
` ......Yes, that's right.`
` ...Oh, how I love you, {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` You could even say I'm in love with you."`
`"......I want to gouge out her eyes so she can see no one other than me.`
` ......Oh, wouldn't that just be to die for?`
` It'd be wonderful to dunk them in black tea.`
` Ahah!"`
`"Who knew she had entranced Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} to this extent.`
` ......It seems I carry a heavy responsibility.`
` Still, this last game truly was close!`
` I was a breath away from defeating Battler."`
`"..................Beato.`
` Can I ask you something?"`
`"What is it?`
` I won't tell you that girl's name.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"...Just when are you going to stop screwing around?`
` ...Do you even have the {i:slightest} intention of winning?"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} threatened her with a low voice that she had never used in front of {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`...It completely blew away the calm atmosphere which had been there until a moment ago.`
`".........You know,`
` I'm supporting you 'cause you're meant to be a witch who can win against {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` If you don't have the power to win against her,`
` then I'm ready to abandon you at any time, got it......?"`
`"...............How scathing.`
` What about me dissatisfies you?`
` ...As you know, my game board is perfect.`
` Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} will never be able to win..."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` Your board truly is impressive.`
` {f:5:Bernkastel} could spend a hundred years,`
` or even a thousand years here, and she would still be unable to win against this game board, it truly is that impressive and perfect."`
`"......That's why, in exchange for letting me borrow that, I made you a witch.`
` .........If I stop being your guardian, you'll immediately go back to being a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` ...Make sure you don't forget that, no matter how much incredible magical power you hold, ......you are nothing more than a temporary witch."`
`"I, ......I know that.`
` ...I am grateful to you..."`
`"Don't speak so casually.`
` I'll forgive that when {f:5:Bernkastel}'s around, but I won't when she isn't.`
` Recently, maybe you've forgotten your debt to me."`
`"Th‐that is, .........n‐...not, ......not so, my Lady......"`
`"...Aah, changed my mind, that creeps me out.`
` You can talk the same way as usual.`
` But be mindful of what you say.`
` ......I have a surprisingly short temper, you see?"`
`"M‐......mm......"`
`"Back to the point.`
` ...Your game board truly is perfect.`
` ......You should be able to defeat {f:5:Bernkastel} without any trouble.`
` ...But that kid won't give in easily.`
` She'll challenge you over and over."`
`"That is no problem.`
` ...It has been certified by you, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` ......My game board is perfect."`
`"Yeah, that's right, it's perfect.`
` ............So long as you, the player, are perfect as well, that is?"`
`".........I don't understand what you mean by this..."`
`"What {i:I} mean by this...?`
` That's what {i:I} want to ask {i:you}.`
` .........You play around a lot in your games.`
` ...At first, I thought it was part of your tactics, because it would completely baffle {f:5:Bernkastel} from time to time."`
`"............But I get the feeling that's not quite true.`
` You're not playing around in a match you know you can win,`
` ......the truth is, you don't care whether you win or lose, do you?"`
`"R‐......ridiculous...`
` How could that be..."`
`"Listen close, okay?`
` Your role is to break {f:5:Bernkastel}, force her to yield.`
` In other words, that means being the victor in this game for all eternity.`
` ......As long as you keep trying to become the {i:certain} victor, then I will give you my power as the Witch of Certainty.`
` ............However."`
`"If you fight in a way that doesn't deny any possibility of your loss,`
` ...that's a different story."`
`"This is a game, of course...`
` In the same way that Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} will lose if I win,`
` ...there will be some days on which I will lose and she will win.`
` The possibility of loss always exists.`
` That is why I—"`
`"...............This is why you're useless.`
` There's no need for this to be a game board for you.`
` It simply needs to be a bird cage to lock {f:5:Bernkastel} up here for all eternity."`
`"...What's the role of a bird cage?`
` Making certain that the little bird inside never escapes.`
` ......What's a bird cage worth if it has gaps that sometimes let the bird out?"`
`".........O‐of course, games exist to be won.`
` So it is impossible for me to lose.`
` ...Therefore, I will continue to win......`
` ...As you wish, for all eternity..."`
`"Good answer—that's all I want.`
` ......I'll allow you to play around and use fakes as part of your tactics.`
` ...It was sometimes effective in this last game."`
`"............But hear this.`
` If you make a move hoping for anything else other than victory,`
` ............make sure you're wonderfully prepared, okay?"`
`"I, I will not do such a thing...`
` I swear it...!"`
`"............Originally, you weren't even a witch,`
` and I can remind you what a truly shabby creature you were at any time.`
` ............If you betray my expectations...`
` At that time, I will have a delightful delightful penalty waiting for you."`
`"...Of the billions of fragment worlds out there, ......I'll send you into the most miserable fragment and seal you there.`
` .........You were miserable in the first place, so it'll be worth choosing a really miserable fragment.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"................................."`
`"Oh, how I love you, {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` ...Scrabble your feet in {f:5:Beatrice}'s bird cage as much as you like,`
` and spend a thousand years learning that you can no longer escape."`
`"......And when you give in,`
` ...I'll train you so that you can't tweet in anyone's palm but mine."`
`"............*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*,`
` ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!"`
`A monotonous electronic sound kept on repeating.`
`The theme of that room was a so‐called "hygienic" emotionless white.`
`{n}...It was a room of a certain university hospital.`
`An ordinary person wouldn't be able to afford the cost of even a single night in this room,`
` a room which neither her doctors, nor she herself, had any doubts would be the last she ever stayed in...`
`Was the person on the bed...`
`............Eva?`
`She looked haggard and aged, to the point that you would not believe it was her, unless you were told.`
`A well‐built man in a suit, waiting in the corner near the door, was having a conversation with the outside in a low voice, over the intercom.`
`...He was a guard protecting Eva's person.`
`After telling the person on the other end of the intercom to wait, he approached Eva's bed.`
`...Eva had been awake for a while.`
`......However, she stared at a single point in empty space, as though her mind was not in the same place.`
`"......Ange ({p:0:縁寿})‐san has arrived in the lobby below.`
` Should we let her pass?"`
`"................................."`
`For a long time, Eva didn't answer.`
`However, bit by bit, her eyes began to regain their focus, and she gave a small nod, indicating that she didn't mind if they called Ange.`
`...Eva herself had been the one to call her.`
` And she was right on time.`
`Eva now refused to meet anyone without an appointment made in advance.`
`The reason the room was dark, even though it was still light outside, was because the curtains were closed.`
`...There was always one guard waiting in the room, and three more waiting in the corridor and the lobby.`
`They were all there to protect Eva's person...`
`Eventually, there was the sound of a knock.`
`Also, there was a message from the intercom that the guest's body check had been completed with no problems.`
`The door was unlocked, then opened,`
` .........and a woman of about high‐school age was standing there.`
`"Chairman.`
` Ange‐san has arrived."`
`Eva reacted and turned her face towards the guest.`
`However, instead of reacting to the guard's call, maybe it would be better to say that she reacted to the smell of Ange's makeup.`
`......Having been shut up in this room for so long, Eva was sensitive to small changes in smell.`
`"........................`
` So you came.`
` ......Ange."`
`"......Yes, I did.`
` You did call me."`
`On Eva's face, you couldn't find the expression of one warmly welcoming their niece.`
`{n}...And on Ange's face, you couldn't see the expression of one pleased to see their aunt.`
`Eva waved her arm, which had grown as thin as a withered branch, and motioned for the guard to leave.`
`The guard bowed silently and went out into the hall.`
`"......It's not only stuffy, but dark too.`
` Why don't you have the curtains opened...?"`
`"...............And then the hitman you hired will shoot through the window, is that what you're planning......?"`
`".........If it came to that, I'd much rather be the one paid to do the hit.`
` All I'd have to do is relax at home for a month and the job would take care of itself."`
`"...Heheheheh, hahhahhahhahha......"`
`Their discussion was quite morbid for an aunt and niece.`
`...However, they didn't look like they were joking.`
`{n}......At the very least, Eva did believe that someone was after her life.`
`All of the Ushiromiya family's massive fortune had come into the possession of Ushiromiya Eva.`
`...It was said that this fortune also included the ten tons of hidden gold that Ushiromiya Kinzo was rumored to have kept concealed.`
`They could do nothing while this vast wealth was in the hands of the cunning, sly, and extremely suspicious Eva,`
` ......but it was rumored that if it passed on to Ange, who was no more than a young girl, certain people were plotting to snatch it away at once.`
`By now, Eva and Ange were Kinzo's only descendants.`
`{n}......If Eva died, all of the wealth would go to Ange.`
`...And if Ange were to be killed as well,`
` ......that wealth would go to the family of Ange's mother, Kyrie.`
`In this sense, not only Eva, but Ange as well,`
` ...was in a position where it wouldn't be odd at all for her life to be targeted by some unknown person.`
`......And Eva had hated Ange for a long time.`
`Because, after losing her precious only son George,`
` ......she had learned that the only one who had survived to inherit her own wealth...`
`was Ange, who had been absent from that family conference twelve years ago.`
`Eva shunned Ange, hated her, even detested her.`
`She isolated Ange in a special school, and separated her from the youth and happiness normal people have, trying to deprive her life of all opportunity.`
`......However, Eva had succumbed to an incurable illness,`
` and ironically, ...her remaining life was estimated to be the same as Kinzo's had been at that family conference twelve years earlier...`
`Both Eva and Ange...hated each other.`
`Even though they were each other's last blood relatives, ...they hated each other so much that they hoped the other would die quickly...`
`".........And?`
` Why did you go to all the trouble of calling for me...?"`
`"......I don't have much time left.`
` ......These quack doctors still have no idea what I was poisoned with.`
` .........But I know.`
` I'm sure it's that secret assassination drug, the one that foreign intelligence agency was using."`
`"...Ooh, I'm going to be killed, I'm going to be killed...!!`
` Aren't you lucky, very soon, I will die, and then you will be so relieved...!"`
`".................................`
` ...What a pitiable person."`
`This always happened.`
`{n}......She immediately deviated from the main topic, distorting it into a more unsettling discussion.`
`Eva, who was full of suspicion, believed that someone was always after her life.`
`Indeed, after inheriting the vast wealth of the Ushiromiya family,`
` she had used wild methods just like Kinzo had done in the past, and had repeatedly made money by any means necessary, creating many enemies along the way.`
`With a massive supply of capital, she had launched aggressive takeovers against businesses which were starting to have rapid growth,`
` making them buy it back at a high price under the guise of reconciliation.`
`......Ironically, it was the same type of action that her husband's company had been hit with twelve years ago...`
`She had repeated this constantly for the past twelve years.`
`{n}......She had also earned a lot of hatred.`
`If her husband had heard of this from beyond the grave, he might have defended her, saying that this was because of the loneliness from losing her family.`
`......However, no one who knew her now would come to her defense.`
`For some time, Eva waxed eloquent about exactly how her life was being targeted,`
` listing off names of people who likely held hatred for her,`
` and sneering at the fact that she still hadn't been killed.`
`Even when Ange heard her own name included in that list,`
` her expression did not change significantly, and she waited indifferently for Eva to tire herself out...`
`".........You know what?`
` ............I really hate...`
`you."`
`"I'm honored.`
` Same here."`
`".........I built this future for George's sake.`
` ......To think that it would be snatched away by you.`
` ...To think that it would be stolen by Rudolf's daughter...`
` .........I can't bear it.`
` ......To think that not only will I not leave a child,`
` ...but even my fortune will be stolen,`
` .........that, to me, is just...`
`...unforgivable............!"`
`"......In that case, why don't you give all of your fortune to charity?`
` What happened to all those religious people you've requested so many times?"`
`"............*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` They all say the same thing.`
` ...My excessive wealth has become a burden to me.`
` They always say something about how I need to give it up and cleanse myself.`
` ......Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!`
` And then the idea came to me.`
` To stop donating!"`
`For a time, Eva had invited in the founders of several strange new religious cults, perhaps looking for peace in her heart.`
`...But in the end, they did not give her heart any relief,`
` and only further increased her suspicion...`
`".........If you've got money to burn, why don't you start buying up thoroughbreds and make some corned beef?"`
`"I've thought of something even more interesting.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` I've racked my brains over it a lot.`
` What could I do to make things horrible for you?"`
`"......I thought about just killing you.`
` I also thought about erasing all of my wealth, leaving you penniless, and kicking you out of the Ushiromiya family or something."`
`"Wouldn't that be wonderful?`
` A lady brought up prim and proper, made to crawl around and prowl for moldy bread and muddy water.`
` Aaah, that too would be truly glorious,`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"............Having fun?"`
`"Oh, yes.`
` It's fun to scare you...`
` ......But very soon, I will die.`
` ...So I thought about how I can continue to cause you pain even after I die."`
`".........And then, ......*cackle*cackle*!`
` It was surprisingly simple.`
` ......I called you because I wanted to tell you about it."`
`".....................I have midterms coming up.`
` Keep it brief."`
`"...I have decided.`
` I will have you inherit all of my fortune."`
`".................................`
` ...Huh."`
`"Not only that,`
` ......I decided that until the very day that I die,`
` ...I'll increase that fortune as much as I can, inflate it to massive proportions and have you inherit all of it.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*, can you even imagine what that would be like...?"`
`"......No idea.`
` Because I'm stupid."`
`"Ehhehhehheh, *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` No, you wouldn't have any idea, would you...!`
` Look forward to it, it really is fun, being rich...!`
` Every day, from morning till night, monsters from across Japan will come to play."`
`"From now on, your entire private life will be followed by talk shows and weekly magazines.`
` The media criticize me no matter what I do or don't do!`
` If I donate, they'll attack me as a bourgeois, and if I begrudge them that money, I'll be abused as a miser."`
`"Oh, every day really is wonderful, you see?`
` I realized that I would love to invite you to that kind of life, when you are so young and have so much ahead of you.`
` Isn't that just to die for?"`
`".........The public is right in its criticism of all that you've done."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` Yes, yes, I'm sure that they are.`
` ...Go ahead, insult me as much as you want.`
` And then you will be burdened with that criticism."`
`"......Japanese culture says that good people live in honorable poverty, while the wealthy should die.`
` No matter what you do or do not do, you will eventually be held up as a symbol of envy and hate from across Japan."`
`"...*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` I wonder how twisted your life will become after living this way...?"`
`"You will have no allies!`
` No one will listen to your worries.`
` Insulting you will become a public sport.`
` And no one can stop that!"`
`"Oh, Ange!`
` Ehheheheheheh,`
` oh, I'm really looking forward to it.`
` ...I wonder how you will live your life, and how you'll end it...!`
` Relish your life of being unable to trust anyone in the world, love anyone, or talk with anyone...!!"`
`"I'll be patiently waiting for you in hell, waiting for you to come falling down, bringing that story of hardship with you.`
` Heheheheh,`
` ahahhahahahahahahaha,`
` waah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah,`
` ghhkk,`
` *cough*cough*,`
` ghah!!"`
`Her insane laughter turned into a painful cough.`
`Without changing her expression in the slightest, looking completely unconcerned,`
` ......Ange stared at the only survivor of Rokkenjima.`
`Perhaps because he found the violent coughing odd, the guard flew in as he gave a short knock on the door.`
`Ange glanced at him, wordlessly showing that she hadn't moved a step from where she had been.`
`......Ange was prepared for some kind of trap to frame her in Eva's death.`
` However, that was fortunately a needless anxiety.`
`As the guard rubbed Eva's back, he poured hot water from a thermos into a mug.`
`As he did, Eva kept coughing, looking like she was in pain.`
`Ange thought that this was probably the final form of the witch of Rokkenjima, and the last she would be able to see.`
`Eventually, Eva was able to moisten her throat and regain her normal breathing.`
`{n}...However, the glittering madness inside her eyes hadn't subsided in the slightest.`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` That cursed mass of gold and the inheritance of the Ushiromiya headship,`
` ......as well as...`
`.........the name of the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`are now yours.`
` ............Enjoy your insane, twisted life fitting for the name of the witch...!"`
`"I don't care about those.`
` Enough of that, just tell me this.`
` ......What happened on Rokkenjima that day?`
` .........I don't believe that there was an accident.`
` Tell me the truth about what happened that day, and why Mom and Dad and Nii‐san died......!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*...!`
` Oh, that must be the best way to harass you, mustn't it?`
` ......What happened on that day?`
` What happened on this very day in 1986...?`
` ......You want to know what they said before they died, ......don't youuuu...?"`
`"I woOOn't tell yooOOOoouu,`
` aaahh{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah!!`
` I'll leave behind the cursed gold!`
` But you know what? I'll take the truth you desire with me to hell...!`
` That's the best way I can harass you!!"`
`"Upset?`
` If you want to hear, try going to hell and asking your family there!`
` In that case, you better die right now, right?!`
` Ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha, why don't you just give up and die now and foreverrr?!`
` Waaahhah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"`
`That laugh continued until she started coughing again.`
`And that cough did not subside until she started moaning and going into convulsions......`
`October 4th, 1986.`
`On Rokkenjima, the Ushiromiya family's customary and final family conference was held.`
`And on the next day, October 5th...`
`an "extremely unfortunate accident" occurred, and the Ushiromiya family was wiped out.`
`"As good luck would have it", Ushiromiya Eva escaped from that,`
` and succeeded almost all of the Ushiromiya family's fortune.`
`However, due to the many turbulent rumors surrounding the Ushiromiya family, the way Eva acted afterwards,`
` and her unnatural actions at the time of the "unfortunate accident", there was public controversy over whether this might have been a plot to get all of the inheritance for herself.`
`Under pressure from the public, prosecutors attempted numerous investigations,`
` and the media began tracing the outline of the murder plot under the name of Rokkenjimagate,`
` but in the end, they were not able to find sufficient proof that this "unfortunate accident" was a crime.`
`However, because the media continued to give the impression that Rokkenjimagate was a murder plot by Eva,`
` public opinion began to believe that she was the true culprit.`
`...Of course, all that easily condemnable overbearing financial activity which she had carried out using that vast wealth...`
`left a bad impression that only made matters worse.`
`Every time she did something and the rumors started spreading, the talk shows would bring back Rokkenjimagate,`
` blaming the justice system by saying that she was the true culprit, and that the only reason that she hadn't been arrested was because even the police had been bribed.`
`And the impression that she was an evil criminal grew stronger and stronger...`
`Her heart eventually degenerated,`
` ...and ironically, it began to transfigure her into the kind of human that the public expected...`
`By now, Eva had no one she trusted, and no family.`
`......Her beloved husband, Hideyoshi, was already no more, and the talk shows would occasionally mention his company,`
` saying that it was run recklessly, while criticizing and disgracing its former accomplishments.`
`Even her beloved son, George,`
` was dramatized as the stereotypical "rich, lazy son" that the public expected,`
` ...and no one even attempted to find out what a simple and honest character he had possessed.`
`...As to how much all of this hurt Eva and ran her to ruin, ...no one was interested.`
`The public was only interested in the idea of an evil woman who had gone so far as to kill her whole family to become a multimillionaire,`
` and in what kind of pitiful final years she would lead.`
`So she changed more and more,`
` ...until eventually...`
`{n}...Eva's personality was transfigured to the point that she was treated as a lunatic......`
`It was said that she sometimes remembered that this was exactly the same way her father Kinzo, who she had once admired, had been in his later years,`
` and laughed at herself with scorn...`
`And, on the day of that final family conference...`
`Because Ushiromiya Rudolf's daughter, Ange, had been sick and had stayed with her mother's family, she had not participated.`
`At the age of six, she lost her family and gained Eva as her guardian.`
`Since Ange had become Eva's only blood relative,`
` Eva "took very good care of her".`
`She had imposing guards always surrounding Ange's person, to prevent her from coming to harm.`
`......Ange had even her right to play with friends, to come home from school together, and to enjoy the seasons together...stolen.`
`"So that she can live a full and pleasant school life",`
` Eva sent Ange to an elegant boarding school which took care of her every need, completely isolating her from the world.`
`She didn't even know the popular songs that girls her age might hum.`
`She was never once given a chance to enjoy window shopping with her friends, or stuff her mouth with crêpes,`
` ...much less an encounter with a member of the opposite sex to make her heart throb.`
`Ange did not have a single friend.`
` If anyone carelessly acted friendly with Ange, they would be scolded by the guards, or else the teachers.`
`......All of them were strictly ordered not to let the peasants approach the daughter of the esteemed Ushiromiya family.`
`During that time, the talk shows were always talking about Ushiromiya Eva, and always spreading rumors about her many financial evil deeds.`
`......Those who found out that she was her "daughter" naturally began to keep their distance.`
`...Even now, she was called a witch at school, and any time something adverse happened,`
` it was baselessly whispered as truth that the school was operating according to her wishes, and that she had something to do with it.`
`The environment makes the person.`
`{n}By now, she had a heart as hardened as those around her feared.`
`...She trusted no one, and didn't even try.`
`{n}She loved no one, and didn't even try.`
`And on top of all of this, when Eva caught an incurable illness,`
` it was whispered that this too had been planned, and this time, Ange was set up as the mastermind...`
`Everyone whispered that the daughter of a witch was a witch.`
`{n}Even the talk shows and the weekly magazines whispered that.`
`...So Ange, too,`
` because of that,`
` no,`
` as though it might as well be true, accepted it.`
`Therefore, since she already believed that she was a witch,`
` when she heard that the name of the Golden Witch was being turned over to her, she felt nothing if not completely unfazed.`
`However, she was at least sure of one thing.`
`This title of witch that she had inherited would definitely never be inherited by anyone else.`
`She would be the last head of the Ushiromiya family, and the last, isolated, Golden Witch......`
`Ange could be seen on the roof of a skyscraper.`
`Compared to the winds of the world which had beaten down upon her until now, this strong, cold wind was warm and pleasant.`
`Below her lay a beautiful nighttime scene, and a dazzling river of red and white lights.`
`It was a clear sky tonight.`
` ...So there really should have been countless stars stretching out over the sky.`
` ...However, the light from the ground was so bright, you couldn't see them at all.`
`...Ange couldn't help but think that what she really sought lay somewhere in that unseen starlight.`
`The world of reality below her looked so far away from here.`
`...This place felt to her as the closest to the world she should really be in.`
`............There was only one thing that Ange cursed:`
`Why had I not been able to go to that family conference, on that day twelve years ago?`
`If I had gone, I would probably have been able to be with my family forever.`
`...Recently, ...I've been having a dream about my family, over and over again.`
`My self of twelve years ago calls out frantically, urging them not to go to the family conference.`
`But both Mom and Dad are too far away, and my hand won't reach them.`
`I reach for the hand of Battler nii‐san, who always really loved me—for the hand that would always pat my head—`
` .........but even though it looks like it's so close to reaching, even that falls short.`
`For some reason, I started having that dream over and over again.`
`......Whenever I have that dream,`
` I repeat my useless effort inside the dream, trying to stretch out my hand even more forcefully.`
`If only Battler nii‐san at least could have lived...`
`.........then perhaps, at least the two of us could have supported each other through life in this cold and lonely reality.`
`But his hand never reaches me.`
`So even if I climb to the roof of a building as tall as this one,`
` ......I am distantly separated from all of them.`
`......A mysterious girl appears in my dreams and urges me.`
`That girl in my dreams urges me to arrive at the truth of what happened twelve years ago.`
`"........................`
` ......If I could learn...`
`what happened to Dad and everyone else on that day,`
` ............would they come back?`
` At least one of them...!"`
`There was no way...`
`...that anyone existed who could answer those words.`
`I understand.`
` .........In this world, I have no family, no friends, no one.`
`So,`
` ............let's go.`
` ...Let's go home.`
`{n}......To where my family is.`
`From the beginning, ...Ange's figure had been on the far side of the fence.`
`The scenery below her eyes was distant, beautiful, and so fantastical that it did not give rise to the slightest bit of fear.`
`If I face down, I'll surely be taken to the world below.`
`......So I faced up.`
`Because I wanted to be taken to the world above, the world where my family was.`
`.........Who cares about vast wealth.`
` Who cares about cursed gold.`
`{n}Who cares about the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`What I really want...isn't something that even a mountain of gold will help me obtain...`
`What I need for that...is just the small amount of courage...to take a single step forward.`
`............Just then,`
` ...I definitely heard a voice.`
`{n}I knew that voice.`
`The voice that had always......called to me in my dreams...`
`Before my eyes, ......in other words, in mid‐air above that jet‐black nighttime scenery...`
`......There was the figure of that girl I had seen in my dreams...`
`She spoke again, with the same voice I had heard inside my dreams.`
`".........Your assistance is needed."`
`"...My...`
`.........assistance......?`
` Who needs it......?"`
`".........Your family needs it.`
` ...Your family is eternally imprisoned in the two‐day span that began on this day twelve years ago."`
`"I‐...if I save them,`
` ......does that mean my family will come back?!"`
`When I asked the question I most wanted to ask, the girl cruelly stopped talking and hung her head.`
`"......I cannot promise that.`
` The enemy is the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...A mighty opponent.`
` I cannot compete with her.`
` ......But another Golden Witch might be able to manage something."`
`"............I, I don't know...what you're talking about."`
`"......The only one who can oppose the {f:5:Beatrice} of 1986...`
`is the final {f:5:Beatrice}, of 1998.`
` .........In other words, you.`
` Ange.`
` .........{f:5:Ange Beatrice}."`
`"That witch from twelve years ago...`
`...took away my family.........?"`
`"Yes.`
` She is responsible for what happened to your family.`
` ............The source that always leads to your future of isolation."`
`"........................`
` ......My...`
`...family's...`
`......killer."`
`"......In exchange, I will search for the fragment with the ideal world that you wish for, the world where your family comes home.`
` .........But I can't promise you that your desire will be granted.`
` ...The game board of the 1986 {f:5:Beatrice} is quite perfect."`
`"......I had planned on bringing you that ideal fragment as a present today, but I still can't find it.`
` ............It's a very firm fate.`
` I haven't seen the likes of it since I fought with {f:5:Lambdadelta}."`
`".............................................`
` I,`
` ......I don't know...`
`...what you're talking about."`
`".........I'm giving you a chance for revenge.`
` ...In exchange, I promise to find and bring you the happiest resolution that it is possible for you to receive."`
`"..............................Revenge......"`
`"......It may be a fruitless effort.`
` Even if you succeed in your revenge, there's no definite proof that your family will return.`
` Even with a miraculous probability, you may only be able to bring one person back."`
`...Ange now understood the meaning of that dream.`
`......That dream where it seemed that, with just a little bit more, her hand might at least be able to reach Battler nii‐san.`
`"A miraculous probability......is still higher than zero, right...?`
` Is it about one percent...?"`
`"......All probability values are powerless before the result.`
` So I cannot tell you that number."`
`"But unlike if I don't do anything, there definitely is a small possibility."`
`"Yes.`
` As long as you do not throw your hope away.`
` ...But prepare yourself.`
` It is extremely close to zero."`
`"..................`
` Alright.`
` I'm in."`
`"......Are you sure?`
` You'll probably never be able to come back here again."`
`"This is not the world where I belong.`
` ......And...as for the world where I do belong...I'll find it myself.`
` Tell me your name."`
`"The Witch of Miracles, {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` And by that name,`
` I acknowledge you as the Golden Witch, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}.`
` ......As of now, you are a true witch."`
`The instant she proclaimed that I was a witch...`
`...I felt dizzy, as though something inside me had changed drastically.`
`Just then, I heard a slam.`
`{n}...It was the sound of the door connecting the staircase to the roof being opened.`
`There were Aunt Eva's guards.`
`...“Guards” only in name.{n}Aren't they the cage that's closest to me, shutting me in?`
`They saw that I was already on the other side of the fence and dashed forward, horrified.`
`"20, target found.`
` Requesting assistance on the roof."`
`"Ange‐san...!`
` We were looking for you!`
` It's dangerous there, so quickly, come this way!"`
`".........What's that?"`
`"......My fan club.`
` ...I'm pretty popular."`
`"No point in getting caught.`
` .........Let's go."`
`Looking annoyed, {f:5:Bernkastel} turned on her heels.`
` ...In the jet black sky.`
`Watching that perfectly casual gesture, I followed her as though it was completely normal.`
`"Ange‐san!!!`
` Wait!`
` Don't be hasty, look ooooooooooouuuut!!"`
`"Oh, it's no good, it's no goddamn good at all.`
` Time to go. <See you again>."`
`"Please send a limo to get me.`
` 'Cause everyone else will be with me too.`
` See you."`
`"Wahahahaha, you alright, Battler‐kun...?!`
` We're already on the ground, y'know, you can't fall any further than that, wahahahaha...!"`
`"Uu, *giggle*giggle*!`
` Gonna faaall, gonna faaall, *giggle*giggle*!"`
`In the lobby of the Niijima airport, Maria dashed around in excitement.`
`{n}Battler's uproar in the plane must have been very funny to her.`
`"Hey, Maria!`
` That's enough!`
` ...Sorry, Battler‐kun.`
` Don't take it badly."`
`"Man, you're {i:pathetic}.`
` A grown‐ass man like you still can't handle vehicles?"`
`"Urgh, shut up...`
` All humans have one or two things they can't handle..."`
`"Battler‐kun, why don't you come with your aunt on an overseas trip sometime soon?`
` What about Europe?`
` I'm sure you'd conquer your fears after the half‐day plane trip.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"...Stop it, Mother.`
` I'm sure Battler‐kun's dislike for vehicles is inherited."`
`"Oh, from Asumu‐san?"`
`"......For some reason, she just couldn't handle vehicles.`
` Pretty much anything other than a bicycle or a car.`
` Whenever we tried to take a trip somewhere far away, that woman was so annoying with the "no not this, no not that,`
` I'm scared I'm scared, I'm going to fall I'm going to fall, scream scream"."`
`"Children tend to learn that things which their parents can't seem to handle are dangerous.`
` Battler‐kun must have seen Asumu‐san doing something like that and learned that vehicles are scary."`
`"*giggle*giggle*.`
` Could it be Asumu‐san's genes, I wonder?"`
`"Beats me.`
` Those'd be some damned annoying genes.`
` .........Stop talking about Asumu.`
` Right now, the one who's here is you.`
` Right?"`
`"...You're right, sorry."`
`"Heyyy, the cars are here!`
` Exactly three of 'em.`
` All in, all in!"`
`"Gonna fall, gonna faaall!!`
` Where's the parachuuute, where's the parachuuuute!!`
` Uu‐uu, *giggle*!!"`
`"You little rapscallio~n!!`
` Wait, wait, come back here, you!`
` I'll sentence you to the tickle punishme~nt!!"`
`"Ehheheheheh.`
` It's good that they're in high spirits.`
` If Battler‐kun and Maria‐chan weren't there, the atmosphere in that plane would have been very stiff."`
`"Thanks.`
` I'll take that at face value.`
` ......Hey, brats!`
` The taxis are here!`
` Save the games for later."`
`"Uu‐uu!!`
` Taxiii, taxiii!!`
` I'm gonna be first iiiiin!`
` *giggle*!!"`
`"Hey!`
` Maria, and you too, Battler‐kun, stop fooling around!`
` You'll bump into someone!"`
`The tone of Auntie Rosa's voice became a little frightening.`
`Battler, too, had started to think that perhaps he really was fooling around too much...when, just as expected, he bumped into someone.`
`"Oh, sorry..."`
`"Battler‐kun, your family is going in the car over there.`
` You're keeping them waiting."`
`Rushed on by George, Battler made an apologetic gesture to the person he had bumped into and ran up to his parents, who were telling him to come quickly.`
`With clunking sounds, the doors on the three taxis were shut one after another, and they departed, heading for the harbor......`
`......As their taxis dashed away...`
`...the entire world grew suddenly dull,`
` ......and slowed to a halt.`
`Voices, the wind, and even sound—`
`absolutely everything ceased, and as if they had been frozen in the instant a photo was taken, everything moving or about to move...`
`...stopped.`
`People, machines, clock hands, even the dust dancing in the wind—frozen.`
`{n}People who were in the middle of walking—frozen, with one foot still raised.`
`{n}Scraps of paper dancing in the wind—frozen, pinned in midair.`
`......And among these stationary figures in this world that had come to a standstill, a single one...moved.`
`It was a woman.`
` The very woman that Battler had just bumped into...`
`It was truly the slightest of movements.`
`Her gaze dropped, her shoulders lowered a minuscule amount, and she sighed.`
`{n}...That was all.`
`In a normal world, that probably wouldn't even count as movement,`
` but in this still world, it looked very out of place.`
`...Then something else moved.`
`{n}It was a black cat that had been dozing in the shadows near the taxi rank.`
`It came up right behind the woman,`
` ......and leisurely...changed its form into that of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
`It wasn't a cat.`
` It was a witch.`
`{n}Of course, the woman was also a witch.`
`As the witch stood there, her gaze still downwards, she muttered...`
`".........I can't stop them...`
`...from going to Rokkenjima, can I..."`
`"You cannot.`
` On October 4th, 1986, you are not here."`
`"......So if I had been here, it might even have been possible to stop them all from going...?"`
`"What verbal acrobatics a six‐year‐old girl could possibly perform to persuade them to turn back,`
` I can't even imagine.`
` ......But yes.`
` If you had been in this place, the probability wouldn't have been zero.`
` If there is a probability other than zero, I can find a miracle."`
`"......If I hadn't been sick,`
` ...and they hadn't left me behind......"`
`With her head facing downwards, the witch tightened her fists...`
`{n}...They were trembling very slightly.`
`"You were sick in bed starting October 3rd, 1986.`
` And Beato's game board is a snippet of time beginning on October 4th.`
` ......You are not given the possibility of not getting sick.`
` ...In other words, you are fundamentally an existence which can never step up onto the game board."`
`"Thanks for being so patronizing.`
` ......I'm aware of that.`
` ......I know that just seeing Mom, Dad,`
` .........and Onii‐chan healthy and happy like this,`
` ......that alone...`
`...is a very wonderful miracle...`
` .........I know that all too well..."`
`Ange had been trying to stand in the way of her family, and prevent them from going outside the airport, ......towards Rokkenjima.`
`...But that was impossible for Ange, who could not exist there on October 4th, 1986.`
`Just receiving a shoulder‐bump and words of apology from her older brother...`
`...Even though he hadn't known that she was his sister,`
` ...that was still such a miracle,`
` ......it could have moved her to tears......`
`"............I'm sorry for the sarcasm.`
` I won't waste the miracle you've given me."`
`"I'm glad to hear it.`
` ......Now, let's go with them.`
` To Rokkenjima.`
` Soon, all of the pieces will be gathered.`
` ......The curtain will open on the fourth game.`
` Beato and Battler will already be seated by now."`
`"......To Rokkenjima......`
` ............To the day my...`
`no,`
` ......the day {i:everyone's} fates changed...October 4th, 1986,`
` ...on Rokkenjima........."`
`...What happened on that day?`
`{n}I will expose that.`
` Learn that.`
` And I'll take them back...!`
`As she stood there with her fists still clenched, she surely turned her face to the heavens.`
`{n}A single teardrop from the depths of her eyes dripped down into the air.`
`And when time started moving again, the two witches' figures were sucked into a blowing gale, and erased in an instant.`
`"Good morning, Milady.`
` My, my, you do appear to be in a good mood.`
` What a pleasant awakening you seem to have had."`
`"‘Pleasant awakening’...!`
` I was so excited, I couldn't sleep a wink.`
` After all, the curtain is rising on the oh‐so‐fun fourth game...!"`
`It seemed that she truly had been so excited that she hadn't gotten any sleep.`
`And yet she showed absolutely no signs of tiredness; was that due to her youth, or her low mental age?`
`Ronove chose not to say that aloud, and laughed with a {nobreak:"pu ku ku"} instead.`
`"I really ran that Battler into the ground last time!`
` Ah, that look of "you tricked meee" all over his face!`
` He looked so pathetic!`
` In any case, I do hope he's not still feeling down?"`
`"Feeling down, you say...?"`
`"Mm, well, how to put it.`
` ...You know how he is a bit too sincere for his age?"`
`"Indeed I do.`
` Although one could call that his charm.`
` Pu ku ku..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` You could, you certainly could!`
` Well, speaking of that.`
` You know how he completely fell for the thing I pulled the last time?"`
`"Oh, yes, completely and splendidly.`
` ...His pure, rosebud‐like innocence, arising from never once having been tricked by another since birth, you unreservedly violated."`
`"............Even the joy of running around a field covered with beautiful new snow on a winter morning and trampling it utterly wouldn't even begin to compare."`
`"You took Battler‐sama's innocent heart, Milady,`
` and thrillingly, splendidly, atrociously, mercilessly, and in quite the uncultured manner, enough to make one think "maybe I went a teensy little bit overboard...?",`
` you most assuredly perpetrated the very worst of atrocities against it."`
`"I am quite sure most people {i:would} start to feel down.`
` Pukkukukuku, so much so, that I doubt they would ever want to see your face again."`
`"S‐so you understand...!"`
`"I also, umm, considering that the fourth game is finally getting underway,`
` I thought that it would be such a pain if he was so disheartened that he wouldn't join us at the table,`
` and so, you see, I asked you first, thinking that it would be better to prepare a countermeasure beforehand...!"`
`"Hmmmm...`
` In that case, indeed, I do think you would be well served to prepare such a countermeasure.`
` Most unfortunately, due to your "North Wind and the Sun Strategy", it appears that Battler‐sama has received quite a shock."`
`"H‐hoh...`
` ......A shock, you say... How badly...?"`
`Beato lowered her voice slightly, asking timidly.`
`{n}Ronove went along with that, and lowered his voice in the same way.`
`"......In truth, he has been curled into a ball clutching his knees for some time now.`
` I called out to him several times, but he did not answer.`
` I also carried him something to eat, but he does not appear to have touched it."`
`"...Th‐that is...troublesome......`
` Is he really feeling that down......?"`
`"Pukkukukuku.`
` It is only natural.`
` ...After all, you`
` {nobreak:com‐`
`pre‐`
`hensively}`
` destroyed him, Milady.`
` That would turn most anyone into a misanthrope."`
`"Hoh, distrust of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s? How convenient!`
` Let him give up on {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s and trust witches, wahahaha...`
` ...............O‐...oh,`
` *cough*.`
` Sorry, I took it too far."`
`Beato had tried to joke about it, but it seemed that the situation was quite serious, and after picking up on this, she hid her laughter.`
`"......Is it really that serious...?`
` Sh‐should we wait just a little longer before beginning the fourth game...?"`
`"Because Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}'s guest will be coming,`
` it may be more appropriate to open the fourth game quickly.`
` However, it might be useful if you were to show him a little consideration, Milady."`
`"Consideration!`
` Consideration, you say?!`
` How should I show that...?!`
` He is feeling down, so,`
` ...h‐how about...I cheer him up, or something?!"`
`"When a person's heart is closed off to the light, it is useless to interact with them in a gloomy fashion.`
` You can do nothing but shine with a brightness stronger than the dark."`
`"Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiit, quit messing arooooooooouund...!!!"`
`"Kyaahhahaha!!`
` Battler‐kuun, over he~re!`
` A croissant baked by Ronove‐sama would be wasted on the likes of youuuu!`
` Maybe I'll enjoy it aaalll myself?"`
`Battler's stomach involuntarily growled at the fragrant smell of the croissant.`
`His breakfast plate was empty, but he hadn't eaten any of it.`
`{n}...The biggest glutton of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory,`
` Beelzebub, had waited for Ronove to leave, and had then come to snatch the food away.`
`Battler had discovered her in the process, and they had been charging about causing a crazy amount of noise ever since.`
`Even though Beelzebub could have ended it by either giving it back already or else throwing it into her own mouth,`
` she intentionally ran around in circles, making fun of Battler.`
`"Give me my breakfast back, damn iiiiiiit!!`
` If you give it back now, I'll let you off with a single flick to the forehead.`
` But just you try eating it!!"`
`"What, are you gonna eat me inste~ad?!`
` Kyaha!`
` Try it if you think you can! I'll bet I'd be as sweet as honey pancakes.`
` ...kya!"`
`"Gotcha!!`
` Right now, I'm more interested in that bread than your thighs.`
` Be a good girl and give it heeeeeeeeere,`
` fugagigigigi...!!`
` So, you resist until the eeeeeeeeeend...!!"`
`"Ugugugugu!!`
` No way, no way, I won't give it to yo~u!!`
` Even the croissant wants me to eat i~~t!!!"`
`"Y‐yaa~y, yoo‐hooooooooo, g'moooooorning, Battleeee~r!!`
` Get a load of this guy, first thing in the morning and he's back to moping already~?!?!`
` It's the beginning of a new day, and a new game, you know, so get your spirits up and let's get this party starte{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeddd!!"`
`...The door opened forcefully.`
`Like a marathon runner drawn on a {c:86EF9C:certain caramel box},`
` with her hands held high and with an idiotic cheeriness,`
` ......Beato appeared.`
`For some reason, countless country flags and confetti scattered everywhere, creating what was clearly intended to be the perfect party atmosphere.`
`......Battler and Beelzebub, who had been grappling on the floor over the croissant, completely forgot about their argument and stared at her speechless.`
`"Kya‐...kyahahahaha!`
` Good morning, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama!`
` Well, that's all for me!`
` Here, Battler‐kun, say aa~h!"`
`"Mggmffff!!"`
`"Mmmffmmmff, *munch*munch*, ...*gulp*.`
` .....................`
` ......H‐hey, morning, Beato...`
` ......Glad to see you're in perfect form this morning."`
`....................................`
`Beato and Battler looked at each other.`
`{n}...It seemed that neither had a clue what was going on with the other.`
`"B‐......Battlerr......?`
` Wh‐wh‐what is this, Ronoveeeee,`
` he looks like he's in high spiriiiiiiits!!`
` He isn't clutching his knees!`
` And he's answering!`
` {i:And} he was even in the middle of eating!!"`
`"Pukkukukukuku!!`
` No, no, he certainly was clutching his knees, under the blanket as he slept like a baby.`
` I informed him that it was time for him to wake up, but he just wouldn't get out of bed.`
` As for his food, it seems that he was rather too preoccupied with the naughty cat that had wandered in.`
` Pu ku ku, puu ku ku ku ku!"`
`"G‐`
`.........gwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!!`
` You tricked meeeeeeeeeee...!!"`
`"Heh, you should talk.`
` Weren't you the one who played that massive trick on me last time?`
` I don't have a clue what's going on, but I'm glad to see you started your morning with a helping of just deserts.`
` ...Well, anyway, nice one, Ronove."`
`"Pukkukuku, I am much obliged, Battler‐sama."`
`The two stuck up their thumbs as though they had forged some kind of male bond, chuckling together.`
`For a while, Beato acted very energetically, trying to hide her embarrassment......`
`"Heh.`
` Don't take me so lightly.`
` You thought I'd still be hiding in a corner, holding my knees?"`
`"*cackle*.`
` Then who was that person crying their eyes out in frustration last time?`
` I should've collected your copious tears in a bottle and used it as eau de toilette."`
`"Sh‐shut up.`
` That was, uh, you got me a bit with your crappy acting and crazy plot twist, that's all.`
` I made an ass of myself, but you'd better not think that same move is ever gonna work again."`
`"Naturally.`
` Don't disappoint me by falling for the same move over and over again, alright?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Ihihi, yeah, just you watch.`
` I'll teach you that I'm a guy who gets stronger every time he's beaten down."`
`"............But Beato."`
`"Mm, what is it?"`
`"Never do it again."`
`"Hoh?`
` And why is thaaat?`
` So you really are weak against the rear attack?"`
`"............You and I are enemies,`
` and we'll never, ever join forces.`
` ...I now understand that clearly.`
` ......So never again do something as unpleasant as trying to make me confused about that fact."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` You say that, but now that I know it's your weak point, ........."`
`Beato thought they were still joking around, ...but that had disappeared from Battler's expression some time ago.`
`Beato felt as though his eyes were like the surface of black tea gone cold...`
`"You hear me?`
` Never do it again."`
`"..................`
` ......You never know...`
` I might do it again when you've forgotten..."`
`"Never do it again."`
`"............nn, ..............."`
`Pierced by his strong and forceful gaze, Beato held her tongue.`
`She may have thought that Battler would surely be the one to break that silence with laughter.`
`...However, Battler's serious expression didn't change in the slightest.`
`So, to break that silence, Beato had no choice but to start laughing herself.`
`"*cackle*cackle*, hahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!`
` As things should be.`
` You and I are worthy adversaries.`
` No matter how favorable our relationship, we shall never cross that line defining us as enemies.`
` If you have not mistaken this, that is enough for me."`
`"...That's right.`
` I almost forgot that you were my enemy for just a second.`
` I won't show such a disgraceful display again.`
` ......I won't fall for your rear attack again.`
` Ever...!"`
`"...........................`
` ...Heh!`
` Hahhahahyahhahha!!`
` It seems that I am not the only one who cannot wait for the fourth game.`
` I am pleased, Battler.`
` Come, take your seat."`
`"...Sure.`
` Bring it on.`
` ......Clever little tricks aren't gonna work anymore."`
`"Stop acting so tough.`
` You remain in a state of surrender for the last mystery in the previous game, the mystery of Nanjo's murder...!"`
`".........I'm still holding off on an answer for that one.`
` But that doesn't mean I've lost heart.`
` I will break your "red truth" and deny witches—I guarantee it...!"`
`"Hmph.`
` A good disposition.`
` You truly are a man like a phoenix.`
` You don't betray my expectations!`
` With that, let us raise the curtains on the fourth game."`
`"But before that,`
` it seems that we must welcome a new guest."`
`"A guest......"`
`"I am sure you must remember.`
` That mystery woman, who appeared at the very end of the last game without an invitation and spoiled my performance."`
`"......Her........."`
`"She says that she wants to join our game, you see.`
` I took the liberty of sending her an official invitation to join us.`
` Ronove, call the guest."`
`"......There's no need.`
` I'm already here."`
`The voice that answered Beato's call came from the darkness in a corner of the room.`
`Battler turned around in surprise to discover that the mysterious woman was suddenly there.`
`"Goodness gracious.`
` How rude.`
` If you were here, the least I would have expected is a simple greeting."`
`"I don't make a habit of greeting people before punching them.`
` But I will give one after I punch."`
`"Hoh, and what will that be?"`
`"<Good night,`
` have a nice dream>."`
`"*cackle*cackle*, hahhahhahahahahahaha!`
` Entertaining, truly entertaining...!"`
`Beato cackled and clapped her hands.`
`But that was only Beato, and nothing rose to Battler's face except an uncertain smile.`
`"......Whew.`
` So you're the "punch first, ask questions later" type, huh."`
`".............................."`
`Battler met eyes with the woman, shrugging his shoulders as he spoke.`
`{n}But the woman didn't answer, giving only a cold stare in return.`
`"......You helped me out last game when things were really coming down to the wire.`
` I'm grateful."`
`"I don't need gratitude.`
` The way you were acting was just {i:flaccid}.`
` I only told you to get a clue."`
`"Kuhhyahhyahhya!`
` Yesss, Battler is flaccid indeed, hyahhyahha!"`
`Beato tried to laugh in agreement, but the woman wasn't listening.`
`She did absolutely nothing except stare at Battler with ice‐cold eyes.`
`"...............Well, it looks like someone hates me."`
`"I'm just annoyed that you aren't fighting seriously."`
`"You say I'm not serious......?"`
`"You can't possibly mean that the mess you got yourself into earlier was you being {i:serious}?`
` ......What do you take me for?`
` How long do you intend to go along with this witch's farce?"`
`"...I am fighting Beato in my own way.`
` And yes, I'm serious about it."`
`"Serious?`
` .........Don't make me laugh.`
` You keep on drinking tea and chatting with a witch for all eternity and call that fighting seriously?`
` Keep the jokes to just your hairstyle."`
`"......I mean, sure, I wasn't used to this witch's game in the beginning, and I've had a hell of a rough time, I'll admit.`
` But now, I'm finally starting to see how to fight and the knack to doing it.`
` ...If the pathetic way I've been acting makes it look to you like I haven't been serious, you're mistaken."`
`".........Am I?"`
`"Of course, I know I've gotta close in a lot more before I can grab Beato by the collar."`
`"But no matter how long that distance is, it is finite.`
` And with each passing game, I am steadily closing that distance step by step!"`
`"No matter how long it takes, I will close in on that witch, and I'll definitely checkmate her.`
` ......Borrowing one of her common phrases, it might even take me "a thousand years".`
` ...But even so, eventually, I will definitely win."`
`"Why?`
` Because I will never accept losing.`
` I will never stand still, and I'll keep closing in on her!`
` So in other words, there's just one thing I can say for sure."`
`"......I will definitely win against that witch someday!`
` That's how it is."`
`"You sure are patient.`
` Are you even trying to win?`
` Even the finite can become infinite if it's treated the wrong way.`
` You've already become Achilles, unable to even outstrip a tortoise."`
`".........Now I get it. So this is why I'm needed.`
` At this rate, there's no way you could win against the Endless Witch even after a billion years."`
`"......Who are you?`
` It wouldn't kill you to tell me your name."`
`"................................."`
`At that point, the woman fell silent, gazing straight into Battler's eyes.`
`At first, Battler faltered under the firmness of that look and his gaze wavered slightly, but as her eyes continued to stare into his, gradually, he found himself becoming lost in them.`
`......And in their depths, he saw a light that he had seen at some time before...`
`Battler was struck by how strongly they resembled the eyes of a girl who definitely couldn't be here,`
` ......but that was completely impossible.`
`"...I know it's stupid,`
` ......but for some reason, I'm getting that feeling.`
` But that can't be right.`
` ......She's supposed to still be six years old.`
` ............You couldn't possibly be...`
`.........Ange, could you............?"`
`"........................`
` If I said yes, ...would you believe me?"`
`"Nn..............."`
`"I'll put it another way.`
` If I said "I am on your side, so trust me",`
` would you believe me?`
` Would you unconditionally trust some unknown woman you're meeting for the first time just because she looks a little like someone you know?"`
`"......It's because you're so trusting that you were tricked so easily in the last game and cried so bitterly."`
`"......You said it yourself.`
` That kid is six, right?`
` Do I look like I'm six?`
` And despite that, if I were to claim that I'm that kid, you'd still just swallow that story?"`
`"......When you put it like that,`
` ...I guess you're right."`
`"...Sorry.`
` Yeah, I am too trusting.`
` The last game should have taught me that.`
` ......Is this what you meant when you said I wasn't serious?"`
`"Yes.`
` You may think you're fighting against the witch, but all you're doing is making friends with her and having fun.`
` ......You're just competing in a friendly game of chess."`
`"That may be a serious contest for you two,`
` but looking at it from far away, I only see you two playing around like you're good friends, protected by the rules."`
`".....................`
` ......Ihihihi.`
` That's harsh."`
`"But as long as you can't win this game, you won't be released from this place.`
` ......That's why I came.`
` To bring this game to its conclusion.`
` ......You claim that you're closing in on the witch, but you're just like a hamster running around in a wheel."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Oh, those? Those things that run around and around in a wheel night after night?"`
`"At a glance, you might think that running around in a wheel is endless.`
` ......Endless Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` You are just like that wheel.`
` And he is the one running around in the wheel forever, thinking he's fighting, but actually just making a fool of himself."`
`"......This isn't a game.`
` This is nothing more than a cage to keep him imprisoned for all eternity."`
`"Hoh.`
` ......You would liken my infinity to a mere wheel that a mouse plays in?`
` Interesting, interesting, *cackle*..."`
`"Something that's infinite in a certain dimension tends not to be infinite in a higher one.`
` A Menger sponge may have infinite surface area, but that only applies in a world of less than three dimensions.`
` In the three‐dimensional world of reality, it has zero mass.`
` Not only is it not infinite, it can't even exist."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!`
` What an assertive woman.`
` It seems you are worthy of calling yourself my enemy."`
`"............Who...are you?"`
`"I am your ally.`
` And an enemy of witches.`
` .........Of course, you don't have to believe it."`
`"No one can prove that I really am your ally.`
` In fact, it would be preferable if you stayed on your guard strongly enough to find me very suspicious."`
`".........You're right.`
` I got burned bad the last time.`
` I've got to be at least that careful.`
` ...I'm done with getting tricked."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*......!"`
`Beato laughed with true satisfaction in a way that was insulting only to Battler.`
`"People don't just get tricked out of the blue.`
` They neglect to check things for themselves, and entrust that to other people—and that's when they get tricked.`
` ......Saying that you thought the light had turned green just because you saw other people start crossing is no excuse for getting into an accident.`
` Get it...?"`
`"Yeah... I get it.`
` ......You're telling me not to swallow information given to me by others, but to think for myself.`
` .........I've just been swallowing the magic that Beato showed me."`
`"{i:I'd stopped thinking}.`
` That's why it was no good."`
`Battler grimaced as he remembered his many painful losses.`
` ...Seeing that, the witch laughed audaciously once again.`
`"I will advise you in a way that will be to your advantage.`
` Of course, you shouldn't just swallow the things I say.`
` Because no one can provide absolute proof that I'm on your side."`
`In the last game, {f:5:Virgilia}, who I'd thought was an ally, turned out to be on the witch's side after all.`
`......Battler couldn't get that eerie smile worn by {f:5:Virgilia}, who he had even thought of as dependable, out of his head.`
`"So you don't have to unconditionally trust me.`
` Therefore, taking my advice as nothing more than an opinion to be considered is absolutely fine.`
` After all, ......the player who's fighting in a game against the witch {i:is you}."`
`"...Yeah, you're right.`
` Saying I lost because I followed the moves of an outsider would be just too pathetic of an excuse."`
`"Indeed it would!`
` My opponent is Battler.`
` You are nothing more than an outsider.`
` It is good that you understand that.`
` *cackle*!"`
`"No, I'm not an outsider.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}, Ushiromiya Battler,`
` ...and me with my bird's‐eye perspective over you...will fight in a formation almost like a triangle.`
` At a glance it might not seem to be a united front, but fighting together is not the only way to form a united front."`
`"Hoh.`
` What an odd thing to say."`
`"Just now, he described fighting with you as closing the distance.`
` But you can't measure distance with a single eye.`
` Only with two eyes are things visible in three dimensions, and only then can distance be measured."`
`"......And having two viewpoints is meaningless if they're in the same place.`
` You can gauge the witch more accurately if they're far apart."`
`"......Shooting from different positions and different angles.`
` ...So, like crossfire, then.`
` Heheh, interesting."`
`"We will shoot from different positions...and different angles.`
` ......So I won't make friends with anybody.`
` In order to separate my own position and catch the witch in a pincer attack."`
`".........Are you sure about this, Battlerr?`
` This woman may actually be an ambush I set up, you know?`
` She might just be saying something plausible to gain your trust, you know...?"`
`"......Maybe.`
` She's been saying that over and over again herself.`
` ...So, of course, I can't blindly accept her advice."`
`"But I can think for myself and decide whether it's worthy of being trusted or not.`
` As long as I don't stop thinking for myself, I won't be tricked by anyone again...!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` Impressive confidence, Ushiromiya Battleerr!`
` After you've said so much, it makes me want to...`
`trick you all over again, you see...?`
` And I want to see what kind of face you'll make when you realize that you've been tricked yet again!`
` I like it, kuhha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"......So, it looks like you know my name, but I don't know yours.`
` ...Tell me your name."`
`For a while, the woman remained silent without the slightest change in her expression.`
`...She looked as though she couldn't decide whether to say her name or not, or possibly, as though she was deciding what to call herself on the spot.`
`"......Gretel."`
`"Girdle?`
` You wear one?"`
`"That's my name, dumbass.`
` Call me Gretel."`
`"Then should I call myself Hansel?`
` Ihihihi, just kidding, I'm Ushiromiya Battler!`
` Just call me Battler."`
`"............Nice to meet you.`
` ...I hate handshakes.`
` Don't take it personally."`
`"...Yeah, you're right, sorry.`
` I mean, it isn't a sure thing that you're on my side.`
` ......And you only just told me to keep my guard up, too."`
`Battler drew back the right hand he had stuck out.`
`His bitter smile disappeared, and was replaced with a strong expression of resolve for the new game, now in its fourth iteration.`
`"Battler.`
` ......Think deeply about why you must win against this witch.`
` ......You can't stop with something abstract, like "She annoys me so she's going down".`
` ......Have a deep conviction that you'll definitely defeat the witch and escape from this world."`
`".........Because there is definitely...`
`......someone waiting for you to come back.`
` ......For her sake as well, you...`
`..........................."`
`Maybe she had something on her mind.`
` Gretel clenched a fist in front of her chest and hung her head in silence, at a loss for words for a short while.`
`Beato spoke up in a forceful voice, shattering that silence.`
`"Good, that should be enough of an introduction for Gretel or whoever!`
` Come, try to remember, what happened on October 4th!`
` Kuhhihihihihihihi, the curtain opens on the fourth game!!"`
`In unison with her voice, the clock, which had been turned back to October 4th, 1986, ......started to move, as though blown by a suddenly raging storm.`
`While we remained in the witch's tea room, the blue‐gray sea and the green Rokkenjima spread out beneath us,`
` ......and we could see the boat heading there, trailing a wake behind it.`
`The sky was already cloudy, and it seemed that the barrier of the typhoon would soon shut the island away.`
`The boat docked in the harbor,`
` .........and Gohda, who had been waiting there, could be seen helping to unload it.`
`And finally,`
` ......the boat dropped off all of the passengers,`
` .........and began to separate from the island.`
`The relatives started to get swallowed up by the island.`
`"Ahhahahaha!`
` You're as energetic as ever, Maria."`
`"Maria‐chan, you'll trip if you don't look out.`
` Be careful...!"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Gonna faaall gonna faaall, gonna siiink gonna siiink, *giggle*!"`
`...All my fondly remembered cousins I had loved so much dashed away through the beach,`
` ......disappearing as they were sucked into the forest path leading to the mansion.`
`And of course, Onii‐chan could be seen among them too.`
`"......Dammii~it!!`
` Hold it, hold it, Mariaaaa!!`
` You nimble little brat!"`
`"*giggle*! Uu‐uu‐uu!`
` *giggle*giggle*!"`
`Maria onee‐chan, who I had loved, dashed away, and Onii‐chan chased after her.`
`They were swallowed up by the forest.`
`Following in pursuit, Mom and Dad were also swallowed up.`
`The rest of my relatives were swallowed up, too...`
`......Swallowed up, leaving only me behind...`
`You idiot......`
`How long are you going to joke around and play with a witch in a place like this......`
`Come back quickly, ......Onii‐chan......!`
`Don't leave me all alone...!`
`And realize.`
`Realize what a cruel and lonely world I end up isolated in...`
`"Good day to you."`
`".........G‐...good day to you."`
`"Good day to you" is the standard greeting used here.`
`No matter how many years pass by, this style of greeting still feels very awkward...`
`I had responded to the greeting in order to stifle that awkward feeling,`
` but the classmate who had spoken looked at me blankly.`
`"......Oh?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"Ohhh? What's this?`
` I think you must be mistaken, *giggle*giggle*..."`
`Their choice of words and manner were certainly what you would expect of a school for rich girls,`
` but at their core, they were as innocent and cruel as any children of that age.`
`......It seems they found it funny that I'd mistakenly thought the greeting had been directed at me.`
` No, it might be the opposite.`
`...Maybe I should say that they didn't know what to do after being greeted by an introverted kid like me.`
`No, judging by the looks of my classmates, glancing this way over their shoulders and whispering to each other,`
` there were even some who seemed to consider their refreshing morning ruined.`
`......I am...depressing.`
` Because no one likes me.`
`So, trying not to get in the way of everyone's refreshing morning any more, I entered the classroom in a low crouch.`
`......Almost like I was cutting across the aisle in a movie theater while the movie was running.`
`This is an all‐dorm academy called Saint Lucia Academy.`
`It's not a school that just anyone can get into simply by passing a test.`
`{n}...It's a hidden rich‐girls' school, known only to a select group of celebrities from various circles.`
`For lofty nobles who truly wish their daughters to be brought up like saints,`
` this is probably the ideal academy in which to protect them from the impurities of the common world.`
`......But at the same time, it was probably also a convenient place for nobles to confine daughters who they didn't want the public to know about.`
`As well as an academy isolated from the impurities of the common world, it also held excellent potential as a prison school.`
`I was truly among the latter, and spent my days confined in Saint Lucia Academy,`
` .........as the weeks, months, and years dragged on at a mind‐numbing pace.`
`Of course, there weren't that many students like me, and you couldn't tell us apart at a glance.`
`However, even if they didn't come forward, you could usually guess from their appearance.`
`...Because they were always hanging their heads all the time, with an expression on their faces as though the whole world had abandoned them.`
`And every class had one or two kids like that, so even if they didn't speak up about it, you could guess who they were.`
`So.`
`Even though I never confessed that I was one of those kids, at some point, everyone in the class knew......`
`Just like how the seriousness of your injury grants you status in a hospital room, here, status is granted by the nobility of your birth.`
`Those who aren't permitted to go out in public are probably nothing more than filth to them.`
`They must think that getting involved with students like that would dirty them as well.`
`Whenever such a rumor sprang up about a particular student,`
` those fastidious girls would about‐face and grow cold and distant, chasing that student out of all possible social groups.`
`I have that to thank for this quiet and solitary school life of mine...`
`Well, that's only if hearing people whisper behind my back, finding my things lost or broken all the time,`
` and having everyone pretend like they don't know anything about it can be called a quiet school life.`
`I must be wearing a weary expression already this morning.`
`......I can understand completely why my other classmates, who had been enjoying a refreshing morning, would want to click their tongues upon seeing it.`
`Consciously trying to do my best to avoid tainting my classmates' morning, I quietly took my seat.`
`......Then, unusually, someone came to talk to me.`
`{n}It was the class leader.`
`"Good day to you, Ushiromiya‐san.`
` ......You seem to be in a bad mood this morning.`
` Are you certain you're getting enough sleep?"`
`"............Is there some business you have with me?"`
`"You do know you're the only one who hasn't submitted her questionnaire for the class presentation?`
` Did you forget that the deadline was yesterday?"`
`...I'm pretty sure I heard something about that sometime last week.`
`But I think the questionnaire hadn't been passed out yet.`
`{n}All the necessary information would be written on that, so it should have been no problem to forget about it until it was handed out...`
`"......I wasn't given a questionnaire..."`
`"You must have been.`
` The dormitory leader distributed a copy to everyone.`
` If you lost it, all you have to do is honestly say so."`
`"............I lost it.`
` I'll fill it in right now, so could you give me a paper?"`
`Again.`
` ......Either someone lost my paper, or they intentionally didn't tell me about it.`
`But I have no way of knowing who was behind that.`
`In the end, treating it as though it was my own carelessness would settle everything more quickly and without any drama...`
`"Once you've filled it out, drop it in the questionnaire box in the student council room yourself.`
` Our class is the only one, you know, that didn't get everyone's in by last night."`
`As I hung my head at the class leader's scolding,`
` I could hear the giggles and whispers of people watching, coming from no direction in particular...`
`Ushiromiya‐san did it again.`
`{n}Because she never concentrates.`
`{n}She is unsuitable for this school.`
`{n}She has neither class nor manners.`
`......Sorry, girls, but I've dealt with much worse when it comes to unfair personal attacks.`
`I froze my heart and let those arrows of ridicule pass by as I quickly filled out the questionnaire...`
`When I heard the news that Mom, Dad, Onii‐chan,`
` and all the rest of my family had died, I was in the house of my grandpa on my mom's side.`
`The only survivor of the accident was...Ushiromiya Eva.`
`{n}......Only Aunt Eva.`
`Even at the time, I hadn't really liked Aunt Eva.`
`At a glance, she seemed to act kindly to me,`
` but even as young as I was, I could see clearly that she was somehow belittling Dad and the rest, and I didn't like it.`
`So when it was decided that Aunt Eva would take care of me, I was pretty miserable.`
`It wouldn't have mattered if my nice Uncle Hideyoshi and George onii‐chan could have been there too,`
` but I hated the thought of living all alone with Aunt Eva.`
`I had an honest talk with Grandpa about that, hoping that I could live with him.`
`However, Aunt Eva was very insistent that she should be the one to look after me.`
`Aunt Eva had no desire to remarry, so she said I was essential for the succession of the Ushiromiya family.`
`Aunt Eva felt very strongly about the House of Ushiromiya.`
`She firmly demanded to take charge of me right away, so that she could give me an education and lifestyle fitting for the successor.`
`Complicated negotiations with lawyers apparently took place.`
`{n}...But in the end, I was forced to go live with Aunt Eva.`
`After she took me in, Aunt Eva told me something.`
`You must bear all of the glory and history of the Ushiromiya family.`
`And in order to make you a fitting successor to bear that, your life from now on will be dedicated to studying like hell.`
` Sacrifice the rest of your life for the Ushiromiya family.`
`......She was definitive about it.`
`At first, I thought she meant exactly what she said.`
`But I quickly realized that wasn't the case.`
`Because even then, in Aunt Eva's eyes,`
` the one most fitting to be successor was George onii‐chan, who had passed away.`
`At my first meal, I was strictly instructed and interrogated about my table manners,`
` and was forced to listen to her disparage Mom and Dad as though they had been neglectful in my upbringing.`
`I also received the same strict instructions regarding manners at my first party,`
` and I was insulted in public for my clumsiness, and forced to endure insults to Mom and Dad as well.`
`After that happened enough times, I finally came to understand.`
`Aunt Eva didn't really want to make me the successor.`
`She thought that the one who was truly fitting to be the successor was George onii‐chan,`
` ......and she couldn't forgive the fact that it was going to be me.`
`So I was disparaged in front of a lot of people.`
` Humiliated.`
`And she made it known far and wide exactly how inferior I was to George onii‐chan,`
` ......surely in memory of her dead son—`
`no, ...she must still have been mourning his death.`
`......However, that wasn't something I could endure.`
`{n}I couldn't possibly live together with Aunt Eva.`
`......I would be eternally suffocated, continually compared with her dead son.`
`Even as an elementary schooler, I understood that.`
`I ran away from the House of Ushiromiya, and tried to go to my grandpa's house.`
`However, Aunt Eva had already foreseen that.`
`...No, thinking back on it, she might have been luring me into escaping.`
`I was caught by the guards and brought back,`
` .........and for being a coward who had disgraced the Ushiromiya family crest and attempted to abandon the Ushiromiya name,`
` .........I was punished,`
` .........in a way that makes my whole body shake and shiver just remembering it.`
`How should I describe what Aunt Eva was like when she punished me?`
`Frenzied?`
` Gleeful?`
`......The anger and sadness of losing her beloved son, and well as her hatred and pain towards the fact that I was going to steal the headship her son was meant to inherit.`
` And the dark pleasure of being able to let those feelings out on me.`
`......I was pummeled with all of those negative emotions at once.`
`Then, all of my free time and freedom was taken away, and I was put under round‐the‐clock surveillance.`
`I may have lived in a gorgeous mansion, and been dressed in expensive clothes,`
` ...but my heart and my dignity were being trampled upon, and I was the Ushiromiya family's slave,`
` ...its cattle.`
`Compared to that lifestyle, the derisive laughter of my classmates here even felt refreshing.`
` ......It was no match for my heart...`
`After filling in almost all of the fields of the questionnaire with "nothing in particular", I folded it up and put it in my pocket.`
`......Because if I left it in the desk, I might "lose it" again.`
`After dropping it off in the box in the student council room during lunch break,`
` I finished lunch by myself, as usual, and headed behind the school building, where no one was around.`
`......Only the time I spent by myself could protect me from the derisive laughter and whispered comments.`
`Since I was hated and didn't have a single friend, my time alone was the most kind to me.`
`After checking the surrounding bushes to see whether some malicious classmates were hiding and threatening my time of quiet,`
` I finally relaxed the tension from my entire body, knowing that I had gained some true peace.`
`Then...I let out a sigh.`
` ...It lingered, heavy, as though it was the first time I had breathed out today.`
`My previous favorite place behind the vegetable garden storehouse...`
`had been found out by my classmates, and now they would mess with me there, so this was my new lunchtime hideaway...`
`There was nowhere to sit behind the school building.`
`I crouched down against a wall in the shadow of the bushes, opened my bag, and took out a book with an elaborate, old‐fashioned binding...`
`Just glancing at it, you would probably think it was a religious book written in the Middle Ages or something.`
`But this isn't a book.`
` It's a diary.`
`Of course, it's not {i:my} diary.`
`{n}.........There aren't any special things worth writing about in my daily life.`
`Every single day is just gray, ...cold, and dry.`
`{n}When nothing changes from day to day, there aren't any notable changes worth writing down.`
`This is......the diary of Maria onee‐chan, who I had been very good friends with.`
`She was three years older than me and a bit of a funny person, but Onee‐chan was always a warm, wonderful cousin.`
`She would always grab me by the hand and invite me to play some fun game.`
`......I remember that getting to see her was the most enjoyable thing about family gatherings...`
`Though I preface this with "for an elementary schooler", the handwriting that greeted me when I opened the diary was fairly accomplished,`
` and while admittedly it had been written using every other line, the pages were dense with text.`
`Was she just hopelessly obsessed with jotting everything down in her diary?`
`{n}......Probably...not.`
`To her, writing her daily life down in a diary was probably like having a conversation with another part of herself.`
`So rather than a journal in which the events of her day were simply listed,`
` Maria onee‐chan's diary was written like a letter to another Maria, telling her of the events of that day.`
`I had found this diary among her belongings after her death, and had secretly taken it home.`
`At first, I had felt that reading someone else's diary might be boorish, and had been satisfied to just keep it by my side,`
` ......but I was unable to resist turning over a page or two, and slowly but surely I found myself reading through it.`
`And now, .........{i:she had become my only friend}.`
`I gently opened to the page with the bookmark.`
`"......Sorry to keep you waiting, Maria onee‐chan.`
` ......Could you tell me more about your life...?"`
`At the same time,`
` ......a very, very soft breeze blew, tickling the pages.`
`And I thought the open diary might have sparkled faintly.`
`......The weather is good today.`
`{n}Maria onee‐chan loves wonderful rays of sunlight.`
`So I'm sure she's in a good mood.`
`On the open diary, ...no, in the world of the diary, Maria onee‐chan showed herself...`
`She had been nine, I believe, when she died.`
` ......So her appearance was already younger than mine.`
`But I call her Onee‐chan, and in turn, she fondly calls me just Ange.`
`"Uu.`
` Ange, you were slow getting here today.`
` Was it packed at lunch......?"`
`"......Yes.`
` It's always packed.`
` Because groups of friends install themselves in the seats and stay there even after they've finished eating.`
` It's pretty fatal if you go to the dining hall late.`
` ......I was on cleanup duty today."`
`"......Uu!`
` I'm fast at eating!`
` The faster you eat, the more you can play!`
` Uu!"`
`Maybe she noticed that I was still bitter about how that duty had been forced upon me, shortening my lunch break by a bit.`
`Maria onee‐chan brightly changed the subject.`
`Grateful for that consideration, I responded that I eat slowly.`
`Maria said something about how she'd teach me the trick to eating fast, and cheered me up.`
`I read it in the diary.`
` No, I heard it from Maria onee‐chan.`
`She was once ranked number 1 among the girls on the speed‐eating leaderboard in her grade's newspaper.`
`She had been very proud of that, but had apparently been a little disappointed that her mother, Auntie Rosa, hadn't praised her very much for it.`
`"Uu!`
` Okay, so I'll start today's story.`
` How far did we get yesterday?`
` Uu?"`
`"Umm......`
` This far.`
` Up to when you got Sakutaro as a present.`
` ......You promised that you would tell me about Sakutaro."`
`"Uu!`
` Talk about Sakutaro!`
` Sakutaro is...a reeeeally cute stuffed animal!`
` I'm sure you'd like him too, Ange!`
` Uu!"`
`"Yes.`
` Tell me about that.`
` ......The lunchtimes I spend listening to your stories are the only times I can feel relaxed at school."`
`"Uu!`
` I'll talk!`
` So about Sakutaro, umm, umm!"`
`Watching Maria onee‐chan, who's always in a good mood, makes my heart feel warm as well.`
`As I listened to her tale, I began to get absorbed into her world......`
`"Happy birthday, Maria.`
` Sorry I got back so late."`
`"Uu!`
` Good job with your work, Mama!`
` I know you're busy, so, waited without crying even when you were late.`
` Was good and waited, watching TV!"`
`"Yes, you're such a good girl, Maria.`
` As a reward for waiting politely, you can order anything you want today.`
` Of course, only as much as you can eat, okay?"`
`"Uu‐uu!`
` Can I change my corn soup to onion gratin soup today?!"`
`"Yes, you can."`
`"Uu‐uu!`
` It's 200 yen more, but can I even change it to prosciutto pizza?!"`
`"Yes, you can.`
` {i:If} you really can eat it.`
` ......But what the hey.`
` It is your birthday, after all.`
` I have to reward you for being a good girl and waiting so patiently."`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!`
` Then, then, can I have enchilada cheesecake for dessert?!`
` And, and, the chef's choice fruit salad and kids' french fries!`
` Want to have a melon soda too!"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!`
` I'm a good girl, I'm a good girl!`
` Praised by Mama, uu‐uu‐uu{p:0:♪}"`
`"*giggle*.`
` You're getting a little too excited.`
` If you don't quiet down a bit, you'll disturb the other customers."`
`When Rosa gently admonished her, Maria stuck her tongue out and eased up a little.`
` ...But it seemed that she was having a hard time repressing her excitement at being able to eat out with her mother again after such a long time.`
`Today was Maria's birthday.`
`Rosa always spent Maria's birthday at a wonderful restaurant.`
`When Maria had still been in kindergarten, they had sometimes invited other kids from the neighborhood over and had a party at home.`
`Rosa would make a wonderful cake, and homemade sweets, and decorate the house herself, making it a huge celebration.`
`But after they moved and Maria no longer had any friends in the neighborhood, Rosa had started splurging at expensive restaurants instead.`
`However, today, they were instead in a normal family restaurant.`
`It was also a little late in the day for a kid like Maria to eat there, even with a parent.`
`Rosa had actually gotten reservations at a fantastical place that Maria would absolutely have loved.`
` Of course, she had also prepared a wonderful cake with Maria's name written on it.`
`......But Rosa just hadn't been able to finish up her work, and had been forced to cancel.`
`Since that had turned into a local family restaurant, Rosa felt a little indebted to Maria.`
`So she was prepared to spoil Maria a bit and let her have whatever she wanted tonight...`
`"......I thought you weren't a very big eater, Maria onee‐chan?`
` Are you sure you're going to be OK asking for this much?"`
`"Uu.`
` I can't eat very much, but I like it when there's a lot lined up.`
` You know, when you have a birthday table,`
` and it's all multicolored with red and blue and green and yellow, it makes you really happy!"`
`"...You're right.`
` When a birthday table is colorful, it does make you feel happy, doesn't it?`
` ......Birthdays at my place were no match for yours, Maria onee‐chan, but I remember the cakes we bought at the cake shop in front of the station were always gorgeous..."`
`Ange thought back to her own birthdays nostalgically.`
`Even though Dad was busy, he sometimes came home just to show up at my birthday party, and then went right back to his company.`
`I was sad at the time, but now I understand how important I was to Dad.`
`Of course, Mom also took very good care of me.`
`In particular, she always had a really good sense in birthday presents,`
` and sometimes arranged for them several months in advance.`
`Even though we always sent an invitation to Battler onii‐chan, he didn't get along with Dad or something, so he didn't always come.`
`......So when he did come, I was really happy.`
`...The birthday parties when the whole four‐person family was together made for fun memories that I will never forget...`
`"Uu~.`
` Your birthday looks like a lot of fun too.`
` Battler and Uncle Rudolf are the life of the party.`
` Noisy and laughing!`
` Ah, Battler got covered in soda, ahahahaha."`
`Maria onee‐chan peeked into my happy memory.`
`It's kind of embarrassing looking at myself, sitting quietly there, wearing the origami helmet that Dad had made as a party trick.`
`In my hand was a paper gun that Battler onii‐chan had folded for me.`
`{n}...And Mom was taking a commemorative photo.`
`{n}It was the happiest moment of my life.`
`"But your birthday's just as good, Maria onee‐chan.`
` So, you get him today, right?`
` Sakutaro."`
`"Uu!`
` Was reeeally looking forward to it.`
` Was so excited the whole time, wondering when Mama would show me the wrapped present in the side of her bag."`
`"Sakutaro" is the name of the stuffed animal that Maria onee‐chan was to receive as a present today.`
`For quite a long time, Auntie Rosa had been making a stuffed animal to give to her as a birthday present today.`
`It was apparently to be a cute lion stuffed animal,`
` and Maria onee‐chan had already given it the name Sakutaro even though she hadn't received it yet.`
`Today, she was looking forward to meeting Sakutaro even more than celebrating her own birthday.`
`Auntie Rosa ran a clothing design company.`
`It did actually seem to have a brand name, too, for what that's worth.`
`{n}......I think it was just called <Auntie Rosa>, in English...?`
`The slogan was supposedly "I can't forgive the way I was before today".`
`...Unfortunately, I've never met anyone who knew of that brand name.`
`Maybe it wasn't that famous.`
`So, in any case, Auntie was pretty skilled with her hands.`
`{n}I heard that some of the clothing she wears she made herself.`
`So making a stuffed animal had to be well within her capabilities.`
`"......A hand‐made stuffed animal... That sounds kind of wonderful.`
` By the way, why did you call it Sakutaro?"`
`"Uu.`
` Actually wanted to call it "Sakura".`
` But it's a male lion, so I was told to give it a boy's name."`
`"So I added a boy‐like "tarou" and called him "Sakutarou".`
` And I forget when the "u" at the end went away!"`
`"Why "Sakura"?"`
`"Uu!`
` Main character in an anime on TV~!"`
`There was apparently a popular anime at the time whose main character was a girl called "Sakura".`
`......The fact that she'd simply borrowed the name of a character she liked was, how should I say it, as innocent and cute as you'd expect from her age.`
`"Uu!`
` Mama, Mama!`
` Still no Sakutaro?`
` Want to let Sakutaro join in my birthday too."`
`"Presents always come at the end, remember?`
` If you open it now, it'll get dirty.`
` Hold on until the meal is over."`
`"Then I'll finish eating quickly!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!"`
`As soon as she proclaimed that, she started tearing into her meal.`
`Auntie Rosa scolded her, telling her not to make a scene.`
`{n}It seemed that she had seen it coming immediately.`
`I had been thinking that, if I were as straightforward as Maria onee‐chan, that would probably be exactly what I would do as well,`
` so it brought a kind of warm smile to my face when my expectations weren't betrayed.`
`In the end, Auntie Rosa succumbed to her daughter's eyes sparkling with anticipation,`
` cleaned up the table, and took out the long‐awaited wrapped present.`
`"Happy birthday, Maria.`
` ......I couldn't spend much time on it, so I couldn't make it very well..."`
`"Uu!`
` If you made it, Mama, I'm happy with anything!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!`
` Sakutaro~, Sakutaro~, uu‐uu!"`
`Auntie Rosa spoke slightly humbly, but Maria onee‐chan was ecstatic even before opening the wrapping.`
`......I could really understand that feeling.`
` It's not a matter of quality.`
`{n}Just the fact that it was a handmade present was more pleasing than anything.`
`"Can I open it?`
` Can I open it?!"`
`"I'd really prefer you to leave it until we get back home,`
` ......but, just for a bit, okay?`
` We'll just take a look and say hello, then put it back, alright?`
` You can give him a proper greeting once we get home.`
` We're in public, so you can't fool around, understand?`
` Can you promise?"`
`"Uu!`
` Promise promise!"`
`"So can I open it?`
` Can I open ii~t?`
` Mamaaa."`
`"Yes, yes, but just for a bit, okay?"`
`"Yaaaaaaaaayyyy...{p:0:☆}"`
`Before Auntie Rosa finished her sentence, Maria onee‐chan started unwrapping the present.`
`And straight away, ......yellow and orange peeked out.`
`What appeared was a slightly blank‐looking stuffed lion,`
` with cute round eyes and a cute white chest.`
`It was about the size of a small pillow.`
` It looked pretty big held by a short person like Maria onee‐chan, but it probably wasn't that large.`
`From the perspective of someone who didn't know better, it would probably look like something cheap bought from a department store or something.`
`But to Maria onee‐chan, it was her mother's handmade stuffed animal, the only one of its kind in the world, and irreplaceable.`
`"Sakutaro~, Sakutaro~!!`
` *giggle*giggle*!!`
` Cute cute, reeeeally cute...!`
` Thank you Mama, thank you Mama, thank you so much for making such a cute stuffed animal for me even though you're so busy with your work...!!"`
`"...Please don't praise me so much, it makes me feel embarrassed.`
` I couldn't take much time, so I couldn't make anything that good.`
` I actually wanted to make one so big that you couldn't wrap your arms around it..."`
`"No, this is good!`
` With this size, we can always be together.`
` We can go out together.`
` Sakutaro~, I'm your onee‐cha~n, uryu~{p:0:☆}"`
`"It really is a cute stuffed animal.`
` So this kid is your best friend Sakutaro."`
`"Uu!`
` Can't go to school together, but we're always, always together at home and he's my best friend."`
`"You know, Sakutaro is verrry innocent and cute, and he's always nice to me.`
` Cheers me up when I'm feeling down, and plays a lot with me when I'm feeling good!"`
`"So I'm not lonely anymore.`
` Not lonely when Mama is busy with work and I'm all alone, and even if no one plays with me at school, not lonely at all.`
` Riiight, Sakutaro~, uryu~{p:0:☆}"`
`......At school, Maria onee‐chan was in similar circumstances to me.`
`Compared to the other kids in her class, Maria onee‐chan's tempo was always a beat too slow.`
`Her impressionability and way of thinking about things were a little peculiar, ......and she was a little too idiosyncratic to blend in with them.`
`Her grades were low as well, and yet she was talkative when it came to her specialist field of the occult, which led to her being treated like a weirdo by everyone else in the class.`
`If she touches you, you'll be cursed... Stuff like that.`
`Everyone in the class acted like she was gross, made fun of her, and avoided her, it seems.`
`Boys who bumped into Maria onee‐chan...`
`would start wiping that part of them off against the other boys, as if they'd gotten something dirty on them.`
`They would pick up her stuff between pinched fingers like it was something filthy and chase the other boys around with it.`
`As for the girls, they appeared to find even speaking to her unpleasant;`
` they ignored her completely, giggling and sneering at her whenever she made a mistake.`
`"............It looks like bullying is the same in all eras.`
` Humans really don't advance.`
` Go extinct already."`
`"......I'm sad to be bullied, but I think it can't be helped."`
`"It can't be helped...?`
` Why...?"`
`"'Cause, there's a rule that says, every class has to have one kid who gets picked on."`
`"......That's a horrible rule.`
` I want to find whoever made that and hit them over the head with a brick.`
` The corner of it, obviously."`
`"If I wasn't there anymore, I'm sure a new bullied kid would be chosen in my place.`
` By staying strong, I can protect them."`
`As she said that, she smiled faintly.`
`.........Maria onee‐chan's way of thinking really is unusual.`
`According to her, there is always a witch residing in the place called school.`
`No, she says that anywhere that a lot of people gather will most certainly have a witch residing there.`
`The witch tries to make the students perish by disease or accidents, so that she can steal their souls.`
` She sometimes also corrupts the souls, leading them down a path of evil.`
`Maria onee‐chan told me that an angel came, not content to let that happen.`
`"......And the angel, she tried to defeat that witch.`
` But the witch was powerful, and the fight continued for seven days and seven nights, but even then, it still wasn't over.`
` The tired‐out witch asked for a truce, and proposed this."`
`"I've heard this before.`
` ......‘Thus far, I have made half of the students in the class become sick or injured.`
` But in exchange, I have protected the remaining half of the students from sickness and injury."`
`"Therefore, if you will make just one member of the class a sacrifice to me, if you will make them "the bullied kid",`
` I shall protect all of the other students from sickness and injury’,`
` .........wasn't it?"`
`"Uu.`
` The angel thought about it.`
` Compared to half the class suffering misfortune, having only one person be the unlucky one would be much better.`
` Plus, the witch was saying that she would protect the safety of all the other students, using her powerful magic."`
`"If there are forty students in a class,`
` ......and the twenty victims are shrunk down to one, then nineteen people are saved.`
` ......A truly logical proposal."`
`I wonder if this fairy tale has some kind of motif.`
`{n}If it's a creation of Maria onee‐chan, a nine year old girl, that would be pretty impressive.`
`"The angel decided to accept that proposal.`
` So, through the single sacrifice, nineteen people were saved.`
` ......So my role is important.`
` The witch is protecting nineteen people."`
`"......Because of us becoming sacrifices?`
` .........Well, I don't remember ever being thanked by those nineteen people."`
`...Maria onee‐chan's thinking is too compassionate.`
`The miserableness of our situations is very similar.`
` ......And yet, there's a difference in our inner peace, just because of a small difference in our way of thinking?`
`"So then, aren't you sad, Maria onee‐chan...?"`
`"Uu.`
` Not sad at all.`
` 'Cause I'll be together with Sakutaro from now on.`
` Right?`
` Sakutaro?"`
`‘Uryuu! If I can be with Maria, I'm happy too~!’`
`"Look, Sakutaro is saying he's happy too.`
` Uu{p:0:☆}"`
`Maria onee‐chan held up the Sakutaro stuffed animal, playing both sides of the conversation herself.`
`I don't understand.`
` ......But that's exactly why I want to reach Maria onee‐chan's level.`
`...It's what makes me so strongly interested in her tale and her words.`
`"Ange, is it tough because you're all alone......?"`
`"......It is tough.`
` But, just the time when I can be with you like this is different.`
` Because I'm not...all alone."`
`"Then if Sakutaro becomes your friend too, it'll be even more fun.`
` Uu!`
` Okay, starting today, Sakutaro is your new friend!`
` Right, Sakutaro~?"`
`‘Uryu?`
` I am...Ange's friend...?`
` Uryuu, Ange~!’`
`Skillfully moving the stuffed animal like it was a puppet, Maria onee‐chan made Sakutaro emote.`
`She was controlling him, but the charming way he waved his short hand and cocked his head to the side...`
`made it feel like he really was a new friend called Sakutaro.`
`Of course, if you were to look at it with cold eyes,`
` you would only see Maria onee‐chan comforting mopey old me with a stuffed animal.`
`......But that stuffed animal had definitely been imbued with a soul.`
`The soul of Maria onee‐chan's love.`
`So I accepted the existence of a being called Sakutaro inside that stuffed animal.`
`"Come on, say hi to Sakutaro, Ange.`
` Come on, you say hi too, Sakutaro~{p:0:☆}"`
`‘Uryu......?`
` Is Ange...`
`...a scary person......?’`
`As Sakutaro timidly looked at me,`
` he unexpectedly met my gaze, and hid behind Maria onee‐chan's back in surprise.`
`......Maria onee‐chan really is good at playing with stuffed animals.`
`"It's okay, Sakutaro.`
` Ange isn't scary, she's a very nice girl.`
` Uu{p:0:☆}"`
`‘...H‐hello.`
` I'm Sakutarou...`
` ......Uryu......’`
`"*giggle*.`
` ......Pleased to meet you, Sakutarou.`
` I'm Ange.`
` I'm glad to be your new friend."`
`I held out my right hand as though asking for a handshake,`
` and Sakutaro's short hand was stuck out towards me, and lightly touched my index finger.`
`After all, the size is all wrong for a handshake between a human and a stuffed animal.`
`{n}This greeting by touching each other's fingers was our handshake.`
`"Uu{p:0:☆}`
` See, now you two are friends!`
` Two people's funner than one, and three people's funner than two.`
` Uu!"`
`‘Uryu~!’`
`Maria onee‐chan had given the name "Sakutarou" to the stuffed animal she was going to receive on her birthday,`
` and had warmed and expanded his existence in her heart for a long, long time.`
`Therefore, even before she had met him, his existence had been sublimated into a personality.`
`From the very first moment they met, the two of them were already friends.`
`Of course, I don't think anything could be as personified and loved as Sakutarou was,`
` but that wasn't anything extraordinary in Maria onee‐chan's eyes.`
`She loved the things she owned very much, treating them just like friends or beloved pets.`
`Maybe it was partly that Auntie Rosa hadn't let her keep a pet,`
` or maybe just her innate desire to treat things as though they were precious.`
`......Maybe it was that she was so isolated, she had been forced to find friends closer to home.`
`Because of all those various circumstances, this wasn't anything extraordinary from her perspective.`
`Yet even so, Sakutarou, ......no, maybe I should call him Sakutaro like Maria onee‐chan.`
`It was certain that Sakutaro was a stuffed animal,`
` ...no, a friend, who was more loved than anything, or anyone.`
`"Hello... It's Mama.`
` You're in a good mood, do you have a friend over?"`
`"Uu!`
` Playing with Sakutaro!`
` Listen what he said, *giggle*giggle*!"`
`It was already past nine at night.`
`Rosa had asked out of surprise since this wasn't an appropriate time for a friend to be over,`
` but when she thought about it, Maria didn't have any friends who would come over to play, did she...`
`Even so, to think that she would have so much fun playing with that stuffed animal.`
`Rosa was very pleased that Maria had liked her birthday present so much.`
`"I'm sorry.`
` Mama just can't get her work finished...`
` We're having a tough time with next season's lineup.`
` It looks like we're finally starting to get noticed bit by bit, and I really want to somehow make an impact here that can meet their expectations..."`
`"Staying over again?`
` Yep, that's okay.`
` Do your best, Mama!"`
`"R‐really?`
` Thank you, Maria...`
` Thanks for understanding about Mama's work..."`
`Rosa was very surprised that Maria had accepted with such indifference that she couldn't come home.`
`Telling Maria that she would be coming home late or staying overnight had been a heavy burden for Rosa.`
`Maria would start crying about how lonely she was on the other end of the phone, and it took a lot of time and effort to calm her down.`
`To think that Maria would accept it in such high spirits...`
`Is this also thanks to Sakutarou?`
`...Rosa was once again pleased that she had given such a good present.`
`"I'll make sure I can come back by this time tomorrow.`
` Let's eat dinner together tomorrow.`
` You haven't eaten dinner yet, have you, Maria?`
` Buy a bento at the convenience store and eat that.`
` No sweets, and no soda.`
` Make sure you get a receipt with your change, understand?"`
`"Uu!`
` Shopping with Sakutaro, shopping with Sakutaro...!"`
`"H‐hey!`
` Not Sakutaro, have him watch over the house!"`
`From Maria's manner of speech, Rosa got the feeling that Maria had been going shopping with that stuffed animal without her knowing about it.`
`Rosa's forehead creased, and after sourly telling Maria that she was absolutely not to, she hung up.`
`"Uu...`
` Mama said I can't go shopping with you..."`
`‘Uryuu...`
` Can't go shopping with Maria...`
` Staying home alone...will be lonely...’`
`"Why did Mama say not to go shopping with you...`
` Uu..."`
`‘Uryu...`
` ......She must be...embarrassed for people to see you and me together...’`
`"......Embarrassed?`
` Why?"`
`‘Mama often says not to take me outside.`
` And she usually words it like, no, you're too old for that now...’`
`"Uu?`
` But I'm not embarrassed at all to be with you."`
`‘I am a lion, ...but I'm a stuffed animal.’`
`"You're a lion and a stuffed animal, but you're my friend.`
` So let's go out together{p:0:☆}`
` Just when Mama isn't around, as a secret.`
` Uu?`
` Are you embarrassed too?"`
`‘I'm not embarrassed, but......`
`...uryu, ...the people outside are a little scary...’`
`"So that's it!`
` Okay, I'll make it so you don't have to be scared about going outside!`
` Leave it to me, I've got something useful...!"`
`Maria started fishing around her messy room.`
`Rosa often told her to clean it up, but she was just bad at cleaning up her room.`
`However, she knew more or less where everything was.`
`So much so that whenever Rosa would take it upon herself to tidy up, Maria would have trouble finding things.`
`"Found it!`
` Look, look, Sakutaro.`
` A knapsa~ck!"`
`Maria proudly held it up high.`
`Sakutaro looked at the gaping‐open knapsack and shifted uneasily...`
`‘Uryu...... Maria, you aren't saying......’`
`"Uu!`
` This way, we can go shopping together, and you won't be scared!"`
`Maria held Sakutaro up, and started stuffing him into the knapsack.`
`At first, she tried to stick him in head‐first, but then he'd be upside‐down and suffocate.`
` So she pulled him out and tried pushing him in again, feet‐first.`
`‘Uryuu...!`
` It's tiiight and craaamped and daaark.`
` Uryuu!`
` Mmggh.’`
`"See, it's alright.`
` If you stick your head out, it isn't cramped and it isn't dark, so it won't be scary.`
` And it's a good view.`
` Uu!"`
`‘Uryu, you're right.`
` ......Will it be okay for me to go shopping with you now...?’`
`"Yep, it's okay now!`
` What should we get for dinner tonight?!`
` Come on, let's go out, Sakutaro!`
` Uu!"`
`"*giggle*.`
` Looks like you're having fun, Maria onee‐chan."`
`"Yep, it's reeeally fun.`
` Even things that would be lonely and boring alone all become fun with Sakutaro.`
` Any {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} friend would have to go home when it gets late."`
`"But Sakutaro doesn't go home, so he can be with me all the time.`
` He'll watch TV with me,`
` be together even in the futon,`
` and even hold my hand on scary nights with thunder."`
`"He'll even chase away the monsters in the closet and under the bed.`
` Sakutaro is reliable!"`
`‘Uryu.`
` I'm a lion, so if there's any monsters that scare Maria, I'll show my courage and chase them away.`
` Uryuu, {ruby:roar:gaooo}.’`
`They were so close that it made me a little envious.`
`I'm supposedly older than Maria onee‐chan.`
`But I can call her nothing else; even now she stands above me like an older sister, and I am yet to reach her level.`
`...If only I had a friend close by like Sakutaro.`
`"But both me and Sakutaro {i:are} friends close by!`
` We're aaallways right by your side.`
` It's just that your magic is weak, so you can't perceive us unless you open my diary like this."`
`"......Perceive?`
` You know some pretty difficult words, Maria onee‐chan."`
`According to her, this world is full of magic and spirits.`
`As natural and nearby as a light breeze.`
`"You don't normally notice or see the wind,`
` but when incense or something trails smoke, you can see it, right?"`
`"......Right.`
` And even if you can't see it, it is always nearby."`
`"That's it.`
` Me and Sakutaro are always really close by you, Ange.`
` Gods and spirits and guardians, they're always right next to us."`
`"But if you aren't conscious of them, you can't feel their existence.`
` Like wind that can't be seen with the eyes.`
` But they are certainly near us, and if the smoke called magic draws trails, anyone can see them."`
`I had thought that I could only meet Maria onee‐chan when I opened this diary.`
`But from what she said, she was always with me, and I could meet her at any time if I truly desired to.`
`"Along with the records of my life, I left a fragment of my own soul in my diary.`
` So the power of my magic resides in this diary.`
` But it's very faint, so no one other than you can detect it."`
`"......Only I...can tell?"`
`"Yep.`
` After all, the power of a witch resides in you, just like it does in me!`
` If you study hard, even you can definitely become a great witch in the future."`
`".........A witch.`
` I wonder if that's fun."`
`"Uu!`
` It is fun.`
` If you do that, you'll be able to tell that me and Sakutaro are always by your side, even without opening the diary."`
`"And then every day will be so much fun!`
` And then I can introduce you to all my other friends.`
` And then every day you'll have a lot to do, and it'll be very lively."`
`"That might be fun.`
` ......I do have the grimoire you left behind, Maria onee‐chan.`
` I'll try reading it seriously sometime soon.`
` ......And then I won't be all alone anymore,`
` ...will I...?"`
`"Uu!"{n}{t}‘Uryuu!’`
`Maria onee‐chan and Sakutaro said that at the same time, happy that I had developed an interest in the world of witches.`
`With half of Sakutaro's face peeking out of the knapsack on her back,`
` Maria walked through the late‐night shopping district in high spirits.`
`It was only to be expected given the time.`
` Everyone in the shopping district was either a shop owner lowering the shutters on their shop, or an employee rushing, or else staggering, back home.`
`Amidst all that, Maria, in the best of moods as though she was hiking, probably stood out a great deal.`
`The occasionally passing employees glanced backwards over their shoulders at her with the eyes of someone seeing something out of place.`
`Office ladies giggled at the cute stuffed animal poking its head out of the knapsack.`
`The supermarket had been closed for a while by this time.`
` However, the recently popular convenience stores stayed open until late into the night.`
`It was very convenient for Maria, whose mother's return was often later still.`
`Maria took the knapsack off her back, and hugging it close to her chest, she headed over to the sweet buns corner.`
`She pointed to each of the sweet buns she had eaten before, explaining to Sakutaro that this one was delicious,`
` and that one was pretty good too.`
` Sakutaro seemed to be enjoying it a lot.`
`"I'm going to haaave...the three‐flavor bun!`
` With just this one thing, you get to eat red bean jam and cream and strawberry jam!`
` But sometimes it's green pea jam or white bean jam.`
` There should be one kind of bean jam."`
`‘Uryuu!`
` It sounds fun with all the different things inside.`
` Uryu~!’`
`"And I'll also have a...fruit yogurt!`
` There's fruit in it, but it isn't a sweet, right?`
` Yep, I'm sure Mama will be fine with it.`
` Do you want one too, Sakutaro?"`
`‘Uryu?`
` Can I......?`
` What about the money?’`
`"Uu, no proble~m!`
` Look, it's {c:86EF9C:{ruby:(5000 yen):Shotoku Taishi}}, uu!`
` So I can buy you whatever you want too, Sakutaro.`
` Let's eat together!`
` Do you want a yogurt too?"`
`When Maria made to grab another one of the same fruit yogurt, Sakutaro tilted his head as if he was a little worried.`
`‘Uryu...`
` But I can't eat a big one, so a little one is fine.’`
`"Uu.`
` Then what about this small yogurt?`
` It's 30 yen.`
` That's cheap."`
`‘Uryu!`
` That's good enough for me.`
` Yogurt with Maria!’`
`"Yogurt with Sakutaro!`
` Uu!"`
`Maria put the three‐flavor bun and the two yogurts into a shopping basket, and brought them to the register.`
`The man working the register, previously in charge of the tobacco shop that had been in this spot until last year, rang her up.`
`"I seem to be seeing you a lot at this time of day, little lady.`
` You're a good girl, but next time come with your mother when you go shopping this late, alright?"`
`"Mama said it's okay, so it's alright!`
` Mama always comes home late because of her work, but we aren't lonely.`
` Are we, Sakutaro?"`
`‘Uryuu!’`
`"Really? That sounds tough.`
` Here you go, I'll throw in a free soda."`
`The man working at the store took a can of leftover soda or something from behind the register and packed it into the bag with everything else.`
`"Thank you, mister!`
` Uu!`
` Isn't that great, Sakutaro?!"`
`‘Uryuu!’`
`Since she had been told not to buy soda, she couldn't take it back home.`
`So she decided to drink it on her way back, and not bring the empty can back home.`
`With the plastic bag with the sweet bun in it hanging from her elbow,`
` and hugging the knapsack with Sakutaro in it with that same arm, the two of them walked home drinking the soda...`
`"......Uu.`
` Yuzu and chili pepper soda tastes pretty weird...`
` You want to try too, Sakutaro...?"`
`‘Uryu?`
` .........Uryu‐uryu‐uryu, uryuu!!`
` Pwhaaah.`
` ...Uryuuuu, that was mean, Maria...`
` Nasssty......’`
`"It sure is, uu‐uu."`
`Of course, it's not like she could actually make a stuffed animal drink soda.`
`She just put the can to Sakutaro's mouth and pretended to tilt it.`
`But it was great fun for Maria to share the taste of this weird drink that she had gotten for free with Sakutaro...`
`There was a huge moon in the sky.`
`At times, that moon had been clouded by tears when Rosa had stayed over at work,`
` and Maria had thrown a tantrum and been scolded by her mother.`
`But this moon was very warm, and it seemed to watch over the two of them as they enjoyed their trip home by themselves...`
`Maria and Sakutaro.`
` ......Ange watched the two of them go from behind.`
`"........................"`
`What a...heartwarming sight.`
`The sight of Maria onee‐chan and Sakutaro walking away together...`
`made it very difficult to remember the several occasions on which she had spent long nights crying because her mother hadn't come home...`
`......I couldn't admit this to Maria onee‐chan,`
` ...but if I had been in the same position, even if I had given that stuffed animal the name Sakutarou,`
` ...it wouldn't have been anything more or less than a stuffed animal.`
`Anyone can make a relationship which only distracts you from your loneliness.`
`But Maria onee‐chan was different.`
`{n}Sakutaro wasn't a stuffed animal or a toy.`
`......He was a real friend, and far from just distracting Maria from her loneliness,`
` he changed the nights without her mother into a fun time where they could play all by themselves...`
`Was it because Sakutarou was a special stuffed animal?`
`{n}Because her mother had made it herself?`
`{n}Because it was very, very cute?`
`......Probably...not.`
`If there is a secret here, it doesn't lie within Sakutarou.`
`{n}...I think it probably lies within Maria onee‐chan.`
`".........Is this the power of magic you were talking about, Maria onee‐chan...?"`
`"Uu.`
` To know magic is to notice a lot of friends right beside you who you never noticed before.`
` It's as fun as having a bunch of new toy shops pop up all over the neighborhood!"`
`......If I, too, locked up in an academy without a single friend,`
` ...had the same kind of power as Maria onee‐chan, I wonder if I could make my days just a bit richer.`
`I wonder if I would become able to honestly shed tears on the nights I feel like crying—and crack a smile when the nights are gray.`
`"Yep.`
` You could.`
` You can, Ange.`
` After all, you also have the qualifications to become a witch."`
`".........The qualifications...to become a witch."`
`"I also have the qualifications to become a witch.`
` So I still have a lot more studying and training to do."`
`"I know we'll become wonderful witches, flying in the sky on our brooms, and drawing rainbows with our wands, making candy fall from the sky.`
` I know I can do it.`
` And when I do, I'll show you too.`
` It'll be like a scene from a wonderful dream."`
`Maria onee‐chan said that, making an absolute promise with her smile.`
`......There's no way we can become {i:witches}.`
` But when I listen to her speak, I can believe that maybe...we really could.`
`Because the fact is......that on this troubled night, when not a single flower of a smile could bloom, her magic had certainly given birth to a smile.`
`"......I wonder if I can...`
`.........become a witch."`
`"You can.`
` ......You got a little bit older, so your soul is slightly bound by gravity.`
` So training might be tougher than for me."`
`"But you definitely can.`
` After all, you've already experienced a glimpse of magic."`
`"I have?`
` ......Magic...?"`
`"Yep.`
` Come on, look, I'm not in this world anymore, but you've summoned me, and you're talking with me."`
`".........This is...magic...?"`
`"Yep.`
` You've filled the fragment of my soul that I left in the diary with magic, keeping me revived."`
`"Didn't I just say it?`
` You're able to reunite with me, and have a conversation, and show a smile every once in a while, so you must have some magical talent, Ange.`
` Maria onee‐chan guarantees it.`
` Uu!"`
`"...You told me just now, Onee‐chan.`
` That you're actually nearby all the time, even though I've been thinking that I can only see you when I open the diary."`
`"......If I had more of the power of magic, I could see that,`
` ...and, just like now, ......I could have a conversation with you...?`
` Any time...?"`
`"Yep.`
` We can talk any time.`
` I'm always by your side to say good morning, and I'm even there during class.`
` Let's talk together during boring classes to take your mind off things."`
`"I can also be someone to talk to during meals, so let's always be together like this during lunch break."`
`"I'm with you after school too, and of course, I'm always by your side even when you return to the dormitory.`
` ...It's just that {i:you never look at me except when you open the diary}."`
`"............Even if I close the diary,`
` ...you'll be...`
`by my side, right?"`
`"Yep.`
` I'll be there.`
` So if you try to {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} me and try to talk to me, I can definitely answer.`
` ......If you look hard and try to talk."`
`"............I'll...`
`......give it a try."`
`"It won't be easy, you know?`
` It's not going to go great right from the start, okay?"`
`".........I understand.`
` I'm sure it won't be easy.`
` ......But I...`
`......want to be like you, Maria onee‐chan........."`
`"Uu.`
` Okay.`
` .........Then look at me closely.`
` Look hard."`
`"......Yeah."`
`"Practice slowly closing your eyes and opening them again.`
` ...Don't start shutting them for a long time right away.`
` Burn me into your eyes, then try to blend that onto the inside of your eyelids..."`
`".........Yeah,`
` ......I'm doing it."`
`"Once you can visualize me even with your eyes closed,`
` .........without changing anything, slowly and softly close your eyes.`
` .........Well?`
` Still {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} me?"`
`"Y‐......yes.`
` ...I think...I can probably {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} you..."`
`"Okay, open your eyes again for a second.`
` .........Time for the real thing.`
` Calm your heart, and close the diary.`
` ......When you do, I might disappear for a little while."`
`"But calm your heart and don't rush.`
` ......Then, try to blend me back from the inside of your eyelids, back into your eyes again.`
` ...Slowly visualize me in the empty air.`
` ......In the empty air...{y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} me."`
`".....................`
` ......Okay, I can do this.`
` ............Right,`
` .........I'm closing it,`
` the diary."`
`"Uu."`
`Slowly.........`
`...I closed the diary.`
`When I closed the diary, ......a gray reality filled with dull air unfolded.`
`Of course, Maria onee‐chan's form disappeared.`
`......Give it all you've got, have courage.`
`{n}...Take the first step into the world of witches.`
`I felt like Maria onee‐chan was cheering me on inside my heart.`
`Cheering me on?`
` Really?`
`{n}Isn't that just what I'd like to imagine...?`
`No, that's not it.`
`{n}I just convince myself that it is...and that's {i:why I cannot {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} her}.`
`Maria onee‐chan is always by my side.`
` And even now, she's definitely there, cheering me on to do my best...`
`And I...can hear it.`
` So I mustn't ignore it like it's my imagination or the inner voice of my own heart......`
`......Believe...`
`that Maria onee‐chan is there.`
`I mustn't doubt.`
` ...I believe.`
`{n}Onee‐chan said she's always by my side.`
`{n}I must not doubt that...`
`But as I faced that empty space, that empty back wall of the school building,`
` amidst those almost heartlessly boring rays of sunlight, calling out her name was so much easier said than done...`
`The chains of common sense which had clung to me until today sneered at me, telling me that calling out to the empty air was ridiculous...`
`It was almost like being told to take a step forward off the roof of a skyscraper overlooking a sea of lights.`
`......Maria onee‐chan was telling me.`
`{n}......That it's alright, that I can do it.`
`Stop thinking that you might fall, or that it would be foolish to take a step off a roof,`
` ......and free yourself from those chains of common sense...............`
`"...............whew.........`
` .........haaah, ............`
` .....................Yeah..."`
`I steadied my breathing.`
`{n}I concentrated my mind.`
`Make the form of Maria onee‐chan you can see vividly on the inside of your eyelids...rise to the surface in the empty space before you.`
`.........Understand magic,`
` ......and {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see}...Onee‐chan......`
`"............Maria...onee‐chan.........!"`
`"Huh?!`
` Is someone there?!"`
`Suddenly answered by the sound of rustling bushes and a wild cry, I came to my senses.`
`Apparently I hadn't been the only one behind the school building.`
`{n}No, I'd been so immersed in the world of the diary that I hadn't noticed that someone else had come afterwards.`
`I recognized a group of three beyond the bushes.`
`{n}...They were girls from my class.`
`It felt as though they had come behind the school building to gossip about someone or talk in secret.`
`I hurried out of that place.`
`Because if it became known that I had been alone in a place like this, mumbling to myself, it would probably create more things for me to deal with...`
`"......She said that, right? She did say that?`
` "Maria onee‐chan" or something?!"`
`"Messed up... I think the nutcase is seeing ghosts or something."`
`"Pfff...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!`
` Ushiromiya‐san is so~ funny...!"`
`I could hear the shrill, loud laughter from behind.`
`Irritated and feeling that Maria onee‐chan had been made fun of,`
` I left that place at a quick pace, and then a half‐run once I turned the corner.`
`......And I might have made it to Onee‐chan's world with just a little more time......`
`Frustrating, aggravating... Why does everyone get in my way...`
`{n}I've never gotten in their way, not even once......!`
`I ran and ran, but it still felt as though I could hear their shrill laughs......`
`"Rumor has it, Ange‐chan,`
` that you jumped off the top of a building?"`
`"The groupies were getting annoying, so I thought I'd give them the slip."`
`Ange and an old gentleman wearing an expensive suit were alone in a massive, modern conference room.`
`The conference room was equipped with all the latest equipment for presentations,`
` while keeping intact a refined and composed atmosphere;`
` that alone was enough to make abundantly clear the worth of the corporation that was its owner.`
`However, Ange couldn't have cared less.`
`Looking aloof from the world, she sat slovenly in one of the high‐class chairs for executives with salaries probably north of twenty million yen.`
`"And anyway, I knew they were remodeling on the lower floors and had a safety net, so."`
`Ange dismissed it with an offhand comment, but in reality, it had been a {i:miracle} among miracles.`
`She had shot through several layers of safety netting for the remodeling project,`
` been caught by a multi‐colored banner adorning the atrium, slid down and off it,`
` ...been softly caught by a final banner, landed on the ground without a scratch,`
` and then left that place at a brisk walk... It put Hong Kong movies to shame.`
`"So you knew there was a net—it was still a 200‐meter‐tall skyscraper, y'know.`
` If things hadn't gone according to plan, there'd be a real mess to deal with right now."`
`"......I figured that if I died, then that would be the end of that, more or less.`
` Well, let's just say, I was testing my luck a bit.`
` Put it down to the rashness of youth."`
`Ange shrugged coldly, as though saying that she'd had enough of that topic.`
`At this, the old gentleman, who was looking at the world below through the window, burst into laughter.`
`"So you were testing your luck...!`
` My, my, you truly are Kinzo‐san's grandchild.`
` The nerve to entrust yourself to chance, to put your life in the hands of the gods and think nothing of it.`
` ...The Chairman was also a person who could stake her life on a bet like it was nothing—wonder if this is all part of the Ushiromiya blood."`
`"......You really are going to be something big in the future.`
` Take my advice.`
` Why not put this running away from home act behind you and return to the Sumadera family?"`
`"I heard that Mom had a bad relationship with her family.`
` I don't want to go to the house of people I first met at a funeral."`
`The Sumadera ({p:0:須磨寺}) family is my mom's family.`
`It's a bit of an old family from Kyoto, and unbelievably strict in a way you could never have imagined from the frank way Mom acted.`
`The only person in the Sumadera family I had been on good terms with was Grandpa, who was living separately under the guise of retirement.`
`Mom, too, kept up contact only with Grandpa,`
` and had nothing to do with the rest of the family at all, nor they with her, to an ugly degree.`
`Even for me, Grandpa's house was the only part of the Sumadera family I ever went to visit.`
`Being young, I hadn't really understood it at the time,`
` but I hear that Grandpa, as a man who married into his wife's family, was in an extremely weak position, and his relationship with Grandma was also bad.`
`...In fact, maybe you could even have said that he was hated by Grandma, and confined to the house.`
`It isn't hard to imagine that because she had a soft spot for Grandpa alone,`
` Mom was probably also hated by the Sumadera family.`
`As her daughter, I was probably also hated quite a bit.`
`And yet, they had appeared for the first time at my parents' funeral,`
` shamelessly going on about how I'd grown, like they could actually act like family after all this time...`
`After Aunt Eva died, all the wealth of the Ushiromiya family was inherited by me.`
`If they weren't after that, there's no way they'd have been able to say such disgusting words.`
`"......Well, look, you're all alone now, it's not like I don't get why you'd just quit caring."`
`"It's not not caring.`
` Annoying Aunt Eva has kicked the bucket at last, and I'm finally stretching my legs and taking a relaxing stroll, that's all.`
` ......Everyone else is just making too big a deal out of it."`
`They're all just after the vast Ushiromiya wealth I'm shouldered with, anyway.`
`They must think if they become my guardians, they'll be able to do whatever they please with that wealth.`
`Just how many people have tried to act like a substitute parent and get close to me?`
`"Ange‐chan, you know, if life's treating you rough, you can come talk to me anytime if you want some advice.`
` I think of you as my true grandchild."`
`"...........................haah.`
` ...Let's make that a no‐thank‐you for now.`
` ...More importantly, let's get back on topic."`
`"Ange‐chan.`
` Ask me as much as you want, but I'm hiding nothing.`
` The Chairman was the only one to survive Rokkenjima that day.`
` And she gave up the ghost without saying a thing."`
`"I myself understand nothing.`
` We're all in the dark, as they say."`
`The old gentleman was one of a number of corporate heavyweights who, after Eva had passed away, had been entrusted with the business group she had built up.`
`The one he referred to as "the Chairman", technically the former chairwoman, was Ushiromiya Eva.`
`His company had once had a friendly relationship with Hideyoshi's company,`
` and he had been a close friend of both Hideyoshi and Eva.`
`For that reason, after Eva lost Hideyoshi, he had become the only person to whom she could reveal her true thoughts.`
`When Eva's heart had been torn by the loss of her family, and she had taken it out on Ange,`
` he had also acted as a buffer between the two, so although Ange didn't trust him, she too found him an easy person to pay a visit...`
`"That crime,`
` ...no, accident, I guess.`
` If I call it a crime, I'll get in trouble.`
` ...Sure, I had my questions, just like the rest of the public and the talk shows."`
`"......At the time of the accident, why was Aunt Eva in a place two kilometers away from the mansion, all alone?`
` And on the night of a storm."`
`"At the time, Kinzo‐san was unsure as to who he would choose to be the next successor.`
` ......Publicly it was to be the eldest son, Krauss‐san, but he wasn't well trusted by Kinzo‐san."`
`"......So, to fairly determine a successor from among the four siblings, he made this game‐like test called the riddle of the epitaph...?"`
`"Only officially speaking.`
` ......Kinzo‐san probably planned to make Eva‐san the successor to the head from the beginning."`
`"He wanted to leave the family to Eva‐san, who unlike Krauss‐san was extremely diligent and brilliant, even at the cost of taking back his own rule that the eldest son would be the successor."`
`"...The new rule about giving the family headship to the one who solved the epitaph...`
`was probably nothing more than a farce so that he could snatch the position of successor away from Krauss‐san."`
`"What do you mean by...farce?"`
`"There was no need for anyone to solve that epitaph.`
` Once it had been displayed for an appropriate amount of time, Kinzo‐san would just call Eva‐san, who he truly wanted to succeed him,`
` {i:and give her the answer}.`
` In other words, that itself was the proof of the succession to the headship."`
`"..................There hasn't been any mention of this on the talk shows, has there?"`
`"Well, that's because if you start going on about the succession of the head, it's gonna strengthen the murder theory.`
` I'm no fool myself.`
` I'm not gonna go out of my way to say things that could invite misunderstandings."`
`The way he told it went like this:`
`At the time, the head of the Ushiromiya family, Kinzo, diagnosed with little time left to live, was troubled over the problem of who was to succeed him.`
`Normally, the successor would be fixed as the oldest son, Krauss, as laid out by Kinzo himself.`
`...But in his later years, Kinzo began to think that Eva was more fitting to be head.`
`However, Kinzo, stubborn even to himself and obstructed by the title of successor that he had given to Krauss,`
` searched for an {i:official stance} by which he could skip over Krauss and select Eva as his successor.`
`That official stance was the riddle of the epitaph.`
`The primary successor was still Krauss,`
` but there was a new rule, saying that if someone appeared who could solve the riddle, they would be chosen as the successor to the head.`
`And on the day of what would probably be his final family conference, Kinzo had told Eva the answer to that riddle himself.`
`......In short, it was the same as proclaiming that Eva was the successor.`
`"On that day, Eva‐san was summoned by Kinzo‐san, and that was revealed to her.`
` And so that she could succeed the head, he called Eva‐san to the hidden mansion Kuwadorian, known only to the head."`
`".........And the claim is that she escaped harm in that accident because she was waiting at the hidden mansion just beforehand?`
` Maybe Aunt Eva just killed everyone and made it {i:look} like an accident so that she could steal all of the wealth,`
` and {i:that's} why she's the only one who escaped unharmed."`
`"Well, that's what the papers are shouting about.`
` However, I believe Eva‐san.`
` ......I think there are several points that make her worthy of trust."`
`"For example...?"`
`"That ring of the Ushiromiya family head, which is on your finger as we speak.`
` That ring is the only one of its kind in the world, which Kinzo‐san had specially made.`
` And even the artisan who made it acknowledges that the object on your finger is, without a doubt, that ring."`
`The Ushiromiya family...Head's Ring.`
`That ring, with the heft of gold and the one‐winged crest on it,`
` had diamonds adorning the pedestal, and possessed both stateliness and a sense of gaudy extravagance.`
`Kinzo had worn that on his finger, never removing it even for a moment.`
`The fact that Eva had it was apparently proof that Kinzo had acknowledged her as the successor to the head.`
`"Because Eva‐san did indeed have that ring,`
` and, if you take into consideration that Eva‐san was indeed more capable, and that Krauss‐san was known to have made a fool of himself numerous times in the business setting,`
` I cannot imagine that Eva‐san's story is completely made up."`
`"............Although there's also the possibility that she murdered Grandfather in order to steal that ring.`
` And then, using some kind of trick, she massacred everyone and made it look like an accident."`
`"Ah, yes.`
` It seems the papers are accusing her of massacring her entire family with the aim of keeping all the wealth to herself."`
`"It is true that Eva‐san was the kind of person to take drastic action when it came to the crunch.`
` It could be possible......that she committed the only murders she planned on committing in her life to grab this chance to make the Ushiromiya wealth all her own.`
` ............But you know, I don't think that's true."`
`"What's the second point making her worthy of that trust?"`
`"Eva‐san's family.`
` Hideyoshi‐san and George‐kun.`
` ......You might find this difficult to believe, Ange‐chan, but Eva‐san was a person who treasured her family greatly."`
`......He was right; I found it very hard to believe that, or admit it.`
`{n}But deep inside I knew.`
`Aunt Eva really had been a person who treasured her family greatly.`
`The root of her twisted personality had been nothing more than the sadness of losing her beloved husband and son.`
`Having been used as an outlet for all that emotion, I had no feelings of sympathy for her at all,`
` ......but even so, it's not like I couldn't imagine that losing her entire family had dealt her an incredible shock sufficient to transform her personality.`
`"......You're saying that there's no way Aunt Eva, who loved her family, would have abandoned her husband and her son?"`
`"That's right.`
` If Eva‐san really had been the culprit and massacred her entire family, making it look like an accident,`
` ......her husband and her son would definitely be alive right now."`
`"She'd have tried to wriggle out of it by saying her family was the only one in the hidden mansion by coincidence.`
` If Hideyoshi‐san and George‐kun had both been alright, even I would have probably suspected Eva‐san."`
`"......It's impossible for me to believe that all that wailing Eva‐san did at Hideyoshi‐san's funeral was an act."`
`".........Both of those are circumstantial evidence.`
` That isn't the same as physically showing Aunt Eva's innocence."`
`"Hahahaha.`
` That's just unconstructive.`
` Eva‐san was the only one left alive.`
` And she says that is the truth."`
`"But no one can prove her innocence."`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` And no one can prove that she committed a crime, either."`
`".............................."`
`"And the final point making her worthy of trust—is the police.`
` After all, it was one hell of an incident.`
` Pushed forward by a public in an uproar over the murder theory, the police must have investigated her thoroughly."`
`It's easy to feel something unnatural about the claim that Eva had escaped the accident by coincidence,`
` because she and she alone had escaped to a hidden mansion.`
`Furthermore, at the time, Hideyoshi's company had been right in the middle of a takeover struggle, and had wanted a large sum of cash in order to buy off the big stockholders.`
`It shouldn't be too hard to find a motive there.`
`But as a matter of fact, en route to the family conference, Eva's person had been perfectly clean.`
`Nothing unnatural was found on her that could have been used to brutally murder her family and make it look like an accident.`
`The servants who escaped harm by being off‐duty on that day also stated that they hadn't seen anything strange regarding anyone related to the event, Eva included.`
`Putting all of that together,`
` it could only be concluded that Ushiromiya Eva had headed to Rokkenjima for a normal family conference, no different from usual,`
` and became involved in an accident...`
`"The police placed her under all that scrutiny, and they still couldn't find evidence that it was a crime.`
` ......That was the police's conclusion.`
` Doesn't that put an end to Rokkenjimagate?"`
`"......That just means that the police`
` {i:couldn't find} the evidence of her crimes, doesn't it?"`
`"Oh, come on, you could go on forever that way.`
` It becomes a Devil's Proof.`
` To expose a crime, you just need to find the evidence.`
` But what can you find to show someone's innocence?`
` It's impossible to prove a negative fact."`
`"......Did Aunt Eva commit a crime, or did she not...`
` Because we can't find the data to decide that, the truth will remain a mystery, in other words."`
`".........Well,`
` to put it in the words you're hoping for, that's how it is.`
` Even Eva‐san couldn't conclusively prove her own innocence."`
`"An unfortunate accident occurred on that island.`
` And Eva‐san survived by chance.`
` And that's literally all we know!"`
`"In short, as Eva‐san is the only survivor, it all comes down to whether you can believe her story or not."`
`"......I believed.`
` What she told me about the ring, and her admirable love for her family.`
` And the tears she showed at the funeral.`
` Taking all of that into consideration, I decided I would believe her story."`
`"......But I don't believe it.`
` If she wanted to steal the ring, there were probably many ways for her to do so, and no one knows whether her relationship with her family really was good.`
` It's impossible to prove that the tears at the funeral were the real thing."`
`"......Anyway, in the first place, I {i:hate} Aunt Eva.`
` So that doesn't exactly inspire me to believe her story."`
`"Hahahaha...`
` How does one view the truth of the incident?`
` You and I are at loggerheads on the issue.`
` Even though the information we're given is exactly the same, we develop completely different opinions."`
`".........This kind of thing happens all the time in politics and economics.`
` No matter the enterprise, it will always result in a division of opinions.`
` Do you know why?"`
`".........No?"`
`"It's about whether you have love.`
` ......Depending on whether you feel love for the other side, the way you see things is completely different."`
`"If a person you like gives to the poor, you can respect them, right?`
` But if someone you hate starts donating, you fiercely protest that it's a publicity stunt or they're handing out favors."`
`"No matter what they do or don't do, you thank them if you have love and criticize them if you don't.`
` That's how the world works."`
`"Can you believe Aunt Eva or not...`
` ......You're saying that's the only difference?"`
`"Those who suspect her will probably take anything she does or doesn't do and view it as truly unnatural.`
` And it works in reverse.`
` ......As for me,`
` I think that perhaps, except in extreme cases, truth in this world doesn't exist."`
`"No, even {i:if}...`
`even if truth {i:does} exist, whether you believe it or not is determined by whether or not you have love."`
`"......Can you really call truth "truth" if it isn't absolute?`
` Even if Eva‐san had been able to demonstrate a physical alibi, would you have been able to believe it?"`
`"..........................."`
`He has a point.`
`...I hate Aunt Eva, so I'll probably deny all information beneficial to her,`
` and maliciously interpret all neutral information.`
`......In other words, inside myself, the truth is already decided.`
` And yet I'm still unsatisfied, still searching for the "truth"—so what exactly is this "truth" I'm searching for...?`
`"That's how it is.`
` So no matter what you hear from me, as long as you still suspect Eva‐san,`
` it won't change anything for you, not after all this time."`
`"Even if you got your hands on a piece of hitherto unknown information, I still don't think you'd be able to reach the truth, not the way you are now, at least."`
`".........So I'm incapable...`
`of reaching the truth?"`
`"Well, yeah.`
` No matter what kind of new information or proof you find, Ange‐chan, you aren't gonna change your stance that Eva‐san is the culprit, right?"`
`"Then it doesn't matter what else you look into, it isn't gonna mean anything, is it?`
` {i:The truth inside of you is already decided}."`
`"..........................."`
`"But if...`
`if you don't think of that as truth, and earnestly desire to arrive at the deeper, real truth, there is a single way."`
`"I believe I already mentioned that once, though.`
` Know what it is?"`
`"......You mean...love?`
` I don't really know what you mean by that."`
`"Right now, you are thinking about this while supposing that Eva‐san is the culprit.`
` But that is like looking at things with one eye."`
`"With one eye, no matter how much you squint, you can't see an object in three dimensions, right?`
` That's why you need another eye.`
` Of course, in a different position from the eye you have right now."`
`"............You're telling me to look at things based on the supposition that Aunt Eva isn't the culprit,`
` ...or else, that it actually was a real accident...?"`
`"Yes, yes, exactly.`
` When you think about something, try to look at it from different perspectives.`
` If you don't, you won't understand anything about how it really is."`
`"It's the same with newspapers.`
` With only a single newspaper, you can only see things from the single viewpoint of the writer who wrote the article.`
` Sometimes it takes reading multiple papers before you can process the information rationally and in three dimensions."`
`"......Without love, the truth cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}.`
` .........Mmm, that's got a nice ring to it, wahahaha."`
`Maybe he found it amusing that a cheesy phrase like that had popped out of his mouth.`
`{n}For a while, he laughed, looking pleased.`
`......By that, he was simultaneously declaring that he had told everything that he knew,`
` and that it was about time for me to leave.`
` Understanding that, I got to my feet.`
`"I understand your feelings now, Ange‐chan.`
` You should do as you like for a while, until you're satisfied.`
` ......You were six years old at the time.`
` You lost your family before you could even make sense of it, and I fully understand you feeling like you still don't have closure."`
`"..........................."`
`"You may learn the truth, and you may not.`
` Eva‐san may be the culprit, and she may be a victim."`
`"......I pray that you find the "truth" you believe in, Ange‐chan.`
` A journey at such a young age may be a valuable experience."`
`"Thank you very much...`
` ......I am truly sorry to be such a bother when you are so busy, Okonogi‐san."`
`"No trouble, no trouble.`
` What are you going to do now?"`
`"Well, whatever works.`
` ......I've made appointments with several specialists and people related to the crime, so I plan to pay them a visit."`
`"I see.`
` I hope you can find an answer you can accept."`
`At that moment, company president Okonogi's secretary came in, and handed him a memo over his shoulder.`
`He read it and looked between it and my face.`
`"......Ange‐chan.`
` My apologies that this comes right after telling you to try going on a journey, but I have some information you should lend an ear to.`
` ......It looks like you're in a bit of a nasty fix right now."`
`"People after my money?`
` This is why money is stupid."`
`"Yes, but if you try to sell off the whole shebang and donate the entire sum to social welfare,`
` those people already making plans for your fortune, you're gonna make their eyes pop out."`
`"Oh, so it's the Sumadera family.`
` The arrogance of them trying to act like my guardians."`
`I have the precedent of Aunt Eva.`
`{n}Who would {i:ever} go under the care of the Sumadera family?`
`They probably want, as Aunt Eva had so often threatened in the past,`
` to cut off my arms and legs, throw me in a warehouse, and suck the Ushiromiya family's wealth dry.`
`"A representative from the Sumadera family is coming here.`
` They're saying to hand you over...no no, that they want to protect you."`
`"Representative, you say?"`
`"It's your aunt.`
` Kyrie‐san's younger sister.`
` She has said before that she thinks of you as a little sister."`
`"She must be kidding.`
` At least call me a grandchild, you old granny."`
`"Judging from the context, it seems they're not planning on taking your wishes into consideration.`
` I have a car waiting in the parking lot two stories underground.`
` Go."`
`"......The Sumadera family is telling you to hand me over, right?`
` Is it really alright to let me go?"`
`"You will definitely be someone big in the future, Ange‐chan.`
` Let's call this a favor to be repaid upon your success.`
` ...Go, quickly...!"`
`After bowing silently and deeply, Ange left that place at a dash.`
`After watching her leave, the secretary straightened her glasses and whispered.`
`"The Sumadera family told us to stall her...`
` Is it alright to let her go?"`
`"We did stall her, more than enough.`
` If they still don't make it in time, that's the Sumaderas' error.`
` ......I told Ange‐chan to run for it.`
` And I informed the Sumaderas that Ange‐chan was here.`
` Whether she's caught or not, neither one of them will blame me."`
`"......Everything in this world is...love, you see...`
` It's alright, she'll escape.`
` After all, she's the kind of kid who can jump off a building to lose her pursuers."`
`......Okonogi again looked down at the world below,`
` and muttered "yeah, that'd be beyond me..."`
`Ange was no fool herself.`
`She got off the elevator, and stepped out onto the third floor.`
`A taxi in the second level of the basement?`
`That's so overly courteous that it feels wrong.`
` It's probably better to decline that.`
`But my enemies aren't fools either.`
` They probably have control of not just the underground parking lot, but the first‐floor lobby as well.`
`This is such a massive building.`
`{n}Instead of getting anxious and escaping outside, maybe it's better to stay on the inside and wait it out?`
`No, that's no good.`
` If they gain control of the security room in a modern building like this, I'll have nowhere to run to.`
`This entire building is like a massive dead end.`
`The third floor is the business floor.`
` A girl like me clearly sticks out.`
`Trying not to stand out any more than I had to, I walked at a quick pace, searching for an emergency staircase.`
` ......One running down the outside of the building would be ideal.`
`I found the door to the emergency staircase.`
`After opening that heavy door, I found the outside stairs I was hoping to see.`
`Once outside, I immediately encountered a man smoking a cigarette, who looked like an employee skipping work.`
`{n}After glaring at me, he quickly crushed up his cigarette and went away.`
`It looks like there's no one below.`
`{n}...If I'm going to escape, now is my only chance...!`
`Just when I thought that, with an incredible squealing of the tires, a black car slid directly below me and came to a sudden stop.`
`......It felt from the tire sounds like there were several more of them, and this one had come here to block this path.`
`"......Not bad, Aunt Kasumi.`
` Even your niece leaving by an emergency exit gets a car sent to pick her up."`
`Bam‐bam! The car doors opened forcefully, three men in black suits jumped out, and they looked up at the emergency staircase.`
`......Ahhh shoot, our eyes met.`
`"12, target found.`
` Northwest side emergency stairs, third floor, send support."`
`"Ange‐sama!`
` Please do not move from there!`
` Forgive our roughness...!!"`
`The three of them began to clamor up the emergency staircase.`
`......They already announced that they're planning to be rough.`
` This is pretty bad.`
`They've probably been ordered to bring me back by any means, with one of my arms yanked off if necessary, just so long as I'm still breathing.`
`Clankclankclankclank!!`
` Their heavy, wild footsteps became a helix and began to rise from the lower floors, getting closer...!`
`In the entrance lobby of the building, a woman was walking forwards at a leisurely pace, with seven black‐suited guards in tow.`
`Seeing this ostentatious entrance, the security guards for the building ran up to them, asking if they had an appointment.`
`".........How typical of Tokyo people.`
` You require a name to even understand the status of the person you are talking to...?"`
`"M‐my apologies...`
` The policy at our company is for guests to take a securi—"`
`"......Back down, plebeian.`
` I came because I was called by your president.`
` Call Okonogi Tetsuro here.`
` To think that he would call me here and then not welcome me... How typical of Tokyo people..."`
`"My apologies.`
` Welcome to the Ushiromiya Group, Sumadera Kasumi‐san."`
`With his secretary behind him, Okonogi dashingly appeared from the elevator.`
`Even though both of them wore bold smiles, they were caught in a tension reminiscent of the smell of gunpowder...`
`".........Where is Ange?`
` I came to collect my sister's darling, darling daughter."`
`"Strict observance of time is our motto here at the Ushiromiya Group.`
` The former Chairman herself said that those who can't keep time can't keep contracts."`
`"......You call me all the way to Tokyo to be greeted by this mess?`
` You let her go, didn't you."`
`"She got away...is the wording I would have preferred.`
` We did stall her for quite some time, believe it or not.`
` I'm not surprised she smelled a rat.`
` There wouldn't have been a problem if you had come on time, Sumadera‐san."`
`"This is why you provincials are such a hassle, you're never ever punctual.`
` Wahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!"`
`"............What did you say just now......?`
` What did you say to me...?"`
`You couldn't sense any of Kyrie's sociability in the face of her younger sister Kasumi.`
`She wore on her face the arrogance of the ancient Sumadera family towards the ruined Ushiromiya family,`
` ......as well as pride, because she didn't want anyone to notice that her family was declining so much that they couldn't ignore the Ushiromiya family's wealth.`
`Even at a glance, it was easy to understand why Ange hated everything about her aunt...`
`Kasumi couldn't stand even a slight insult, and while she still smiled, her eyebrows twitched.`
`At that time, one of the men in black suits behind Kasumi whispered to her.`
`"Ange‐sama has been found.`
` We are dealing with her as I speak."`
`"......Oh, I'm glad we made it in time.`
` ......Thank you, Okonogi.`
` It seems I can finally take my naughty niece home.`
` ......I've been so eager to have a nice long talk with that girl in my tea room that I already have the tools ready and waiting, you know.`
` Ehheheheheheheh...!"`
`Clankclankclankclank......!!`
`As the violence of the sound drew a helix, it rushed up at me from below, threatening to swallow me up.`
`Of course, even if I fight them, I stand no chance of winning.`
` Even so, if I run into the building, it'll be like jumping into a dead end of my own accord.`
`The enemies will increase in number with time.`
` If I can't do anything here, I won't have any more chances to escape.`
`Then, three muscular black‐suits came into view below me.`
`One, two, three.`
` Three people.`
` In other words, everyone who had gotten out of the car.`
`If there had been just one of them, I might have been able to wait for the moment of arrival to dropkick him as hard as I could, which might have worked out.`
` ......But it really is impossible with three of them.`
`Wait... Three, huh...`
` ......Three...might be just about doable...`
`{n}......I can do it......!`
`"Whew.........`
` ............haaaaAAAAHHH!!"`
`"Wh—?!`
` Y‐you idiot, stop!!`
` Look ooooout!!`
` Uwaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!"`
`"01 calling 12, do you have her, please respond.`
` ......What's wrong?!`
` Respond!"`
`"Wh‐......what kind of person... Damn it......"`
`.........Nggghh...`
` ......Ouchhh...`
`{n}Look, see... That worked out, didn't it? It's just {i:three}.`
`I've already experienced much higher places, after all.`
`{n}I knew I could jump down {i:just three floors}...!`
`It's a good thing that the car they came in was right beneath me.`
`{n}Even if it wasn't as pleasant as a trampoline, it broke my fall, a little gently, a little roughly.`
`"......Well, that makes me feel wonderful.`
` No one asked you to go and dent that badly."`
`Having broken my fall, the roof of the car now had a massive dent around my body.`
`I guess car roofs are more delicate than I thought.`
`{n}I don't think it's because of my weight.`
`Apparently, the three men on the stairs hadn't anticipated me jumping down.`
`Having realized that they had been outwitted, they were hurriedly rushing back down.`
`I have to run and escape while I have the chance.`
`{n}As I moved my body, the car roof made buckling and popping sounds.`
`But I had been naive.`
` There was no way they'd have all rushed up the stairs without leaving one person behind.`
`There was one black‐suit left in the driver's seat of the car that had broken my fall.`
`{n}He stuck his head out of the window, and when he realized that the thing that had fallen on him was me, he jumped out.`
`In a rush, I jumped off the roof, but his reaction was really fast.`
` ......Either there was a massive reward for capturing me, or a harsh punishment for letting me get away.`
`"15, secured, secured...!"`
`"Owowowow......!!`
` Ghhhh, get your hands off me, let GO!!"`
`I was mercilessly held down against the asphalt.`
` I was being crushed face‐down, covered and pressed down on from above.`
`It was a hold without a trace of elegance, but it really was logical and left me absolutely no room for resistance.`
`I tried to push back with both hands, searching for a way to resist,`
` but I was being pushed down solidly, and I couldn't even tear myself off the asphalt.`
`Then another car came, squealing its tires as it slid to a sudden stop.`
`Guess it's all over.`
`"Gyah!!!"`
`The man that had been crushing me let out a sharp cry.`
` ......He had yelled close to my left ear, making it ring.`
` What in the world?!`
`The black‐suit and I were unceremoniously rolled over.`
`After being turned face up, the first thing I saw was...an arm stuck out right in front of my eyes.`
`".........Amakusa...?`
` Why are you here...?"`
`"Let's talk about that after we've lost them.`
` To the car, quickly, missy...!"`
`Amakusa grabbed my arm and easily pulled me up, spinning me around with himself as the center of gravity.`
`The thought that it was a little like a dance lasted only the few brief moments before he flung me through the open door into the driver's seat.`
`I climbed over the hand brake and slid into the passenger's seat.`
`{n}Pushing me through, Amakusa also got in and took up the driver's seat.`
`Since we had suddenly taken off while I was still on all fours, I had to kick and struggle around on the seat for a while, like a turtle flipped onto its back...`
`Amakusa checked the rear‐view mirror for cars in pursuit, but flew into the artery of the big city without lowering his speed in the slightest.`
`We sewed our way between cars one after another.`
`{n}Just like a chase scene in some action movie.`
`......Tossed about by his horrible driving, I had trouble getting myself reseated.`
`"Any injuries, missy?"`
`"All good.`
` Humans are surprisingly durable.`
` From now on, whenever I miss a down elevator, I'll just jump out a window instead."`
`"Hyahhahaha, looks like air dives are your hobby, missy.`
` Still, I recommend that you bring a parachute next time."`
`"I'll do that, if I remember after jumping."`
`"Hyahhahahahaha, <cool>!"`
`He smacked the steering wheel, guffawing.`
`Need an explanation for this flippantly spoken man?`
`His name is Amakusa Juuza ({p:0:天草十三}).`
`He was originally one of Aunt Eva's guards.`
` If I remember correctly, she hated him for being too jokey and too chatty.`
`He was especially young amongst the guards, but contrary to his outward flippancy, he had hopped from the 1st Airborne of the JSDF to the French Foreign Legion,`
` placing himself in overseas private military companies and high‐class security companies one after another, making for a pretty incredible and unique career.`
`......But I heard that he ran off from both the JSDF and the French Foreign Legion, and that he'll be arrested if he enters France again.`
`{n}Both of these flippant episodes were very typical of him.`
`Apparently, the guards had been sternly told not to chat with me unnecessarily,`
` but I recall that didn't stop him coming to take a pass at me.`
`Aunt Eva had particularly disliked that, and I believe she dismissed him right before she died.`
`"It's nice to hear that casual tone again.`
` What have you been up to since getting fired?"`
`"Coaching people at Blackwater.`
` I came back to this country for some time off, and President Okonogi offered me a high wage."`
`"......And you ran off again?`
` What use is a man like that, I wonder."`
`"It doesn't count as running off as long as I come back by next week.`
` I talked with him yesterday.`
` I was told that you might attract some troublesome people."`
`"Sorry that it turned out to be exactly right."`
`"My name probably came up since I know you, and I've got plenty of experience when things get crazy.`
` Thanks to you, it looks like this'll make for a happy break along with some pocket money."`
`"......Okonogi‐san employed you as my guard?"`
`"He probably wants you to owe him one, missy.`
` ......After I got the axe, President Okonogi helped me out a bunch, you see.`
` He's got me right where he wants me, can't say no to him.`
` Hyahha!"`
`"......Seems that if you let Okonogi‐san help you out, it'll be pretty costly in the future.`
` ......So, where are you planning on taking me?"`
`"Wherever.`
` I'm employed until the weekend.`
` Anything after that'll cost you extra."`
`"How much a day?"`
`"I'll cut you a deal for 50K.`
` Plus expenses."`
`"If you stop cracking jokes, I'll double it.`
` The period of employment is undetermined.`
` It might be several weeks."`
`"...That'll be tough.`
` I'll have to call the boss to get an extension on my vacation."`
`"I just want to investigate that day, more than anything."`
`"......Oh, you're talking about Rokkenjima?"`
`"Yes.`
` What happened on that island twelve years ago?`
` ......I want to investigate it with my own hands, and find a satisfying explanation."`
`"Will you really make any new discoveries at this point, investigating something that happened so long ago...?"`
`"You're right.`
` Which is why this is a journey for my own self‐satisfaction.`
` ......Once I'm done, I'll just throw my hands up and go to the Sumadera family."`
`"......Didn't Aunt Kasumi say something about wanting to treat me to some {ruby:powdered tea:matcha}?`
` Maybe I'll be made to kneel on some sharp wooden blocks and clutch stones or something while we drink."`
`"Damn that sounds freaky, hyahhahahaha...!"`
`"My apologies, we lost sight of her...`
` A single man thought to be an associate assisted in her escape.`
` Judging by his possession of a stun gun and his driving skills, he is no amateur."`
`"............I see. Thank you.`
` .........I'm disappointed, Okonogi.`
` Shall I take this as your answer...?"`
`"Letting her get away was your screwup.`
` Not my problem, I'm afraid."`
`"............I'd dearly like to treat you to some matcha in the near future as well.`
` The next time you are in Kyoto, please do stop by.`
` .........Let's go."`
`"Huh, leaving already?`
` {c:86EF9C:You could have some chazuke before you go.}"`
`"..................*cackle*cackle*.`
` ...Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho...!!"`
`Her back to Okonogi, she laughed at first lightly, but with an increasingly shrill and hateful tone, using that as a substitute for a sharp parting remark.`
`At the exact moment she stopped laughing, the look on her face changed dramatically to that of a {ruby:hannya:demon},`
` but because her back was facing him, Okonogi never saw that expression.`
`Okonogi watched her go, laughing coolly.`
`{n}His secretary whispered over his shoulder.`
`"......Is that alright?`
` Milady Ange is our company's primary stockholder.`
` If the Sumadera family becomes her guardian..."`
`"I get it.`
` But you know, we're the one‐and‐only Ushiromiyas.`
` We can't let them take us lightly."`
`"......Still, looks like he outmanuevered them pretty well.`
` ......Now we'll just let Ange‐chan do as she pleases.`
` I'm counting on you, Amakusa."`
`"......Kasumi‐sama.`
` The getaway vehicle was a rental.`
` The license plate on display was a fake.`
` He's clearly a pro.`
` They will probably abandon the car.`
` Pursuit will be difficult.`
` ......Should we have the police chase them?"`
`"............Let me see.`
` Shall we have them search for a runaway daughter?`
` They are getting paid with our taxes, so we must have them be of some use every once in a while.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho............"`
`"You do realize I left the mansion defiantly insisting to Mother that she should leave it to me?`
` Do you intend to embarrass me further still......?"`
`"It looks like I need to serve some matcha to every single one of you, doesn't it?`
` ......Our underground tea room is cramped, so you'll have to wait in line, won't you......?"`
`"N‐no...`
` We will search with everything we have."`
`"......Ahh, she really is a cute kid, just like Nee‐san.`
` ......Especially that unrestrained, self‐centered side of her.`
` ......Ahh, now I can't see her as anyone but Nee‐san."`
`"Ahh, I'm truly looking forward to it.`
` To think I'll be able to invite Nee‐san's daughter to my tea room......`
` Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho......!!"`
`"......The Sumadera family sure moved quickly.`
` Did Okonogi‐san sell me out...?"`
`"You're joking.`
` He's my client.`
` If he'd sold you out, he wouldn't have hired me, right...?"`
`"...........................`
` ...I guess that's true."`
`"......Ah, so that's why you got off the elevator at the third floor?"`
`"Having a car waiting in the underground parking lot was suspiciously well‐organized of him, you see.`
` I thought that he might have sold me out.`
` ......Although at this point, it's impossible to prove whether there was an ambush set up in the parking lot or not."`
`"Riiight... Damn, the poor guy.`
` Looks like he didn't have your trust, missy.`
` That car in the basement was mine."`
`"Huh......?`
` He was talking about you...?"`
`"I freaked out when the elevator was empty.`
` If I hadn't been able to listen in on their radio, who knows what would have happened by now."`
`"..................So...what?`
` If I had obediently believed Okonogi‐san and gone to the parking lot,`
` there would have been no need for me to do that jump off the third floor...?"`
`"Pretty much.`
` Well, it turned out alright in the end."`
`"........................"`
`.........Well that's something.`
`If I hadn't suspected President Okonogi,`
` ......I could have easily escaped without getting caught in a tough spot.`
`{i:"President Okonogi might have sold me out."}`
`No, because paranoia told me that it was better to suppose that he sold me out, I assumed and {i:decided} that he did.`
`Because I wasn't able to believe him,`
` my truth, regardless of his truth, became "he sold me out"......`
`I thought back on President Okonogi's words.`
`Can you really call truth "truth" if it isn't absolute...?`
`Truth can change completely depending on whether you have love or not.`
`In the end, ......perhaps this thing called "truth" doesn't exist.`
`For each person who speaks of it, another truth is born from their interpretations—that's all there is to it.`
`If I can't accept something that indeterminate as truth,`
` ......then where {i:does} the truth that I really want to find exist?`
` ......And is that something that can be seen with the eyes?`
`I might be surprised to discover...that even if the truth is thrust in front of me,`
` ......it may be something that I cannot {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see}...`
`"......Without love, it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}, is it..."`
`".........This fragment of yours is very lively.`
` It doesn't bore me."`
`"You said to me.`
` You told me to search for the truth of twelve years ago.`
` ......But I feel like it's not really clear to me anymore."`
`"What isn't?"`
`"......What is truth?`
` There are as many truths as there are people.`
` There are as many interpretations as there are people.`
` And those can be twisted by opinions and changed indefinitely.`
` ......Is truth really that indeterminate and vague?"`
`"It is.`
` ......Truth is indeterminate.`
` It can be like a particle, or like a wave, and it can hold conflicting forms at the same time."`
`"You are free to believe that the cat in the box is alive, or that it is dead.`
` ......But the truth is very delicate.`
` It changes its appearance just by being observed."`
`"You're talking about that Schrödinger's cat box?`
` .........Nonsense.`
` If you open the box, you learn the truth.`
` Debating what happens before you open it is armchair theorizing at best."`
`"Yes.`
` And yet, in order to deny those armchair theories, you need to open the box.`
` ......If a box cannot be opened, any and all ideas about its contents are impossible to disprove.`
` In other words, truth."`
`".........As long as truth can't be denied, it keeps its form."`
`"That's right.`
` As long as truth can't be observed, it keeps its form."`
`"So, any reckless statement can suffice as truth if it can't be exposed as a lie."`
`"Yes.`
` ......Even if they contradict each other, endless ideas can exist as truth at the same time without being negated."`
`".........So even something as screwed up as my family being captured by the Rokkenjima witch and imprisoned twelve years in the past for all eternity...`
`can exist as truth as long as we don't know what happened twelve years ago..."`
`"Twelve years ago, on Rokkenjima, the witch called {f:5:Beatrice} wrenched open a space for "endless" imagination, and swallowed everything up into it, using it as a cat box.`
` ......Everything in the unopening box is truth."`
`That's right.`
` {i:We don't know what happened on that island}, so it becomes endless.`
`"......So long as it remains closed, that is.`
` All I have to do is wrench it open."`
`".........But that box was closed up twelve years ago, and I don't even know where it is.`
` ......Even if I were to visit Rokkenjima, just what would I be able to learn, there on that desolated island, about what happened twelve years ago?"`
`"Who knows?`
` What could you learn, I wonder.`
` .........In any event, that is something that can only be done by the person who is able to walk around freely in the world of 1998, twelve years in the future—`
`the final witch, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}."`
`"........................"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}'s game board spans the two days from October 4th to the 5th, 1986.`
` In other words, this means that you are a piece who can move freely outside her game board.`
` ......And even {f:5:Beatrice} cannot influence this future that lies outside the game board."`
`"......When you put it like that, it sounds like I'm a pretty overpowered piece."`
`"The future of twelve years later in which you are placed certainly is distant.`
` However, the further in the future a piece is placed, the stronger the power it holds.`
` ......I told you, didn't I?`
` Truth changes form when it's observed."`
`"Come to think of it, I've heard something related to that.`
` ......Even if one day, all of a sudden, a star in Centaurus were to explode,`
` the light from that explosion would have to travel 4.4 light years, so it would take four and a half years to reach the Earth."`
`"It would.`
` In other words, even if the sun in Centaurus has already died, people on Earth wouldn't be able to perceive that fact for four and a half years.`
` ......Because no method of perception exists that is faster than the speed of light."`
`At the time we learn that the sun in Centaurus exploded...`
`...we Earth people will paint over our past four and a half years of history with a new truth.`
`{n}We will revise history with a new fact: that it exploded four and a half years ago.`
`However, for the four‐and‐a‐half‐year period until we learn that, despite the fact that it has already died,`
` the mistaken truth that the sun of Centaurus still exists will be able to exist as truth.`
`The truth of the future wins out over the truth of the past.`
`".........That's right.`
` By itself, the Rokkenjima accident...`
`would have given rise to nothing but suspicion of a murder plot revolving around Aunt Eva and the Ushiromiya estate."`
`"......But in the years that followed...`
`it was dramatized through the occult, and the plot was painted over as the Legend of the Witch."`
`Even though it was clamored over as a murder plot at the time of the incident,`
` in later years, strange occult theories which claimed that it had been the work of a witch ran rampant, and began to paint over the truth of October 5th, 1986...`
`The murder theory will probably be forgotten over time.`
`......And only the more bizarre, impressive witch theory will continue to remain as superstition, and eventually, paint over the murder theory entirely.`
`"Yes,`
` the false truth that exists before the light from an exploding star reaches Earth is a lot like the human murder theory."`
`".........The wine bottle with a letter inside that drifted ashore several years later, the "message bottle", began to retroactively paint over that theory with the occult witch theory."`
`"......That's right.`
` No witch existed during 1986.`
` The witch took control of Rokkenjima because she was "observed" several years later by us humans of the future, thanks to that message bottle...!"`
`"......A small revision is necessary.`
` The witch could have existed even during 1986.`
` As one of many endless possibilities."`
`"Certainly.`
` Curled up in the cat box, which would disappear if observed.`
` ......That's why the message bottle is so pernicious."`
`"...The witch tried to get out of the box.`
` She made it so that she would be observed, weeding out all possibilities other than the witch theory.`
` ......In other words, to make it impossible for herself to be negated, she negated all possibilities other than the witch theory."`
`".........Well, I'll be damned.`
` So in other words, {f:5:Beatrice} satisfied the Devil's Proof with a frontal attack.`
` And that was part of the witch's plan from the beginning."`
`"The message bottle is information observed in the future after 1986.`
` .........It cannot be observed by {f:5:Beatrice} or Battler.`
` ...It can only be observed by {f:5:Ange Beatrice}."`
`"......In truth, I didn't want to investigate the message bottle.`
` ...After all, reading it would be like listening to the witch's side of the story.`
` Since I've been ignoring all that mad raving about a witch theory, I thought of it as nothing more than a waste of time."`
`"......But Okonogi‐san told me.`
` You can't see things in three dimensions with only one eye."`
`"You mean that at the same time as looking at it from the viewpoint of denying witches, you must also look at it from the viewpoint of accepting witches?`
` ......That is the correct way to think.`
` The number of viewpoints is like a denominator.`
` If the number of viewpoints is 1, the mystery in the numerator doesn't decrease in the slightest.`
` However, the more your number of viewpoints increases, the more the mystery begins to be divided."`
`"I know that.`
` ......The message bottle that washed up on a neighboring island several years after the crime.`
` It passed into the hands of a dilettante.`
` I've made an appointment, just in case."`
`...I was able to hear Aunt Eva's side from Okonogi‐san.`
`Next...would be the witch.`
` Why not, I'll listen.`
`{n}To what {f:5:Beatrice} has to say...!`
`"Three months left to live.`
` It was last year when you said that, Doctor Nanjo..."`
`"......I, I only spoke of what I had determined from his overall physical condition at the time.`
` As a result, it has just worked out that this year, he has—"`
`"Despite the doubt being cast on whether Father can make it to the end of the year, the fact is that even now, he's still enthusiastically immersed in his occult research.`
` And still you would say he has only three months left, Doctor?"`
`"A‐as I've been saying, Kinzo‐san's—"`
`"Is it not a wonderful thing that our respected father still has his vitality?`
` Out of parental respect, all of you desire to greet Father so badly that you scarcely know what to do with yourselves.`
` So you cannot accept the fact that he will not see you."`
`"...Given that you have all begun to prematurely divide up the inheritance while the sun is still in the sky,`
` I completely understand why it is that Father does not wish to see you."`
`"Y‐you've got it wrong, Natsuhi nee‐san.`
` ......We just, umm—"`
`"Not even Dad is immortal—he's gonna die {i:someday}.`
` We aren't telling him to die. We're just saying that he will die {i:someday}.`
` We're just talking together about how to prepare for that."`
`"And that is precisely what is so disrespectful!!"`
`"Stop it.`
` You'll make your headache worse."`
`Krauss told Natsuhi, who had risen from her chair in agitation, to sit down.`
`Trying to smooth over the atmosphere, which had suddenly started crackling with hostility,`
` Hideyoshi put on a cordial smile and motioned for everyone to calm down.`
`"......Natsuhi‐san, don't get us all wrong.`
` Doesn't this country have a proverb, "a departing bird leaves the nest unsoiled"?`
` So we're just talkin' about seein' that bird off.`
` We're discussin' this so we can see Father off cleanly when he eventually leaves on that inevitable journey."`
`"Hahaha...`
` That's just like you, Hideyoshi‐san.`
` Even though you're saying the same thing, you make it sound so intellectual."`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` Unlike you, Nii‐san."`
`"Stop it.`
` That won't get us anywhere.`
` .........So like we're saying, Aniki.`
` We can just forget all of this about the inheritance.`
` It doesn't even matter if Dad hits us."`
`"To make a long story short, all we want is to meet Dad directly and say hello.`
` Even if Dad says he doesn't want to.`
` If he's locked up in his study, we'll borrow a key from Genji‐san if we have to.`
` Right, Rosa?"`
`"...Oh, ...well, umm...it's not like we're forcing you...`
` ......It's just...we haven't said hello to Father in such a long time."`
`"If his remaining life really is short, then there's even a chance we might never be able to see him again...`
` ......Today might be our final opportunity to exchange words with Father..."`
`"Yes, just like Rosa says.`
` You do realize that if he only has three months left, it wouldn't be odd for him to pass away any time now?"`
`"And you're telling us we don't even have the right to talk with him one last time?`
` ......I think that is a bit much, don't you...?"`
`"......If the conversation you all intended to have with Father really was a greeting, I am sure he would see you gladly."`
`"But Father has already heard exactly what kind of disrespectful topic you have lowered yourselves to!`
` Father would not be the only one who would prefer not to see you under such conditions.`
` If you wish to blame anyone for Father not seeing you, you need look no further than yourselves, wouldn't you say?"`
`"Heheheh.`
` Exactly.`
` I should think you would be able to understand why Father doesn't wish to see your faces without racking your brains over it.`
` Father has seen through all of your stringent financial situations."`
`".........What are you talking about?`
` ...I don't have a clue what you're going on about, Nii‐san."`
`"Heheheheh!`
` Do you think I don't know about all of your circumstances...?"`
`Eva and the rest realized that he had seen through to the dire straits they were in,`
` and they entered into a back‐and‐forth argument, at first putting on a bold front and denying it,`
` and then ultimately returning to the original point, and objecting by repeatedly demanding to be allowed to see Kinzo.`
`...The sweet smell of the black tea Rosa had gone out of her way to buy had been completely wasted.`
`The only good thing she could take away from this was that the children weren't here to see it.`
`......The fact that they had gone to play at the beach right after lunch was the sole redeeming aspect.`
`Eva was attempting to get violent with Krauss, and Hideyoshi and Kyrie had cut in between them, trying to calm both sides.`
`......Then, Kyrie sighed deeply and spoke.`
`"............I'm sorry, Krauss nii‐san.`
` I know I'm an outsider, but I wonder if you would let me speak for a moment.`
` I have a proposition."`
`"What is it, Kyrie‐san?"`
`"......First, and this includes my husband as well,`
` for many years, we have made light of the efforts you have made by living with Father and taking care of him.`
` ...Don't you think so?"`
`".........Well, I guess so.`
` ...We've got it easy since we get to go out into the world, but Aniki's been babysitting Father for decades now, and sure, that must have taken a lot of effort.`
` ......I'll accept that, but what's your point, Kyrie?"`
`"We must acknowledge that Krauss nii‐san is Father's caregiver.`
` ......Isn't that true?`
` We have always feared Father, and have been pushing the task of taking care of him onto Krauss nii‐san.`
` I believe everyone here would acknowledge his efforts."`
`"Wouldn't you?`
` Eva nee‐san?"`
`".....................`
` ......And so what?`
` Nii‐san is Father's caregiver?`
` Who is an outsider like you to decide things?!"`
`"O‐...OK, calm, calm.`
` ......Kyrie‐san, what are you talking about?"`
`".................................`
` ......Kyrie, please continue."`
`"We should be more grateful towards Krauss nii‐san and Natsuhi nee‐san.`
` ......We should say thank you for always taking care of Father."`
`"It's because we have no feelings of gratitude that we have these unproductive clashes.`
` ......Isn't that right, Krauss nii‐san?"`
`"Hoh.........now this is a surprise.`
` I did not think you would be able to understand our efforts,`
` which even my true siblings have not stopped to consider."`
`"......It is a natural duty for the successor to the Ushiromiya family head."`
`"Yes.`
` It {i:is} a responsibility of the successor to the head, isn't it?`
` ......And it's precisely because you take care of Father that we must acknowledge you as the successor."`
`"Excuse me!!`
` Am I going to be consulted on this at any point?!!`
` You outsider, what gives you the—"`
`"Wait, Aneki!!`
` .........She's right.`
` It's just like Kyrie says.`
` You are the successor, Aniki, because you're taking care of Dad.`
` It's just like you said."`
`"..................ah—"`
`"...............nn—"`
`Rosa noticed, and then Eva too.`
`Eva's barking demeanor towards Kyrie for advancing the discussion on her own disappeared in a flash,`
` and she instead stared at Krauss and Natsuhi.`
`......Natsuhi couldn't understand that sudden change, and was slightly flustered.`
`"Krauss nii‐san.`
` ......If you would accept just a few conditions,`
` we won't ask you to let us meet Father again until he dies."`
`"Of course, we won't tell you to let us see him at the moment of death, either.`
` ......We could even be absent at the funeral."`
`"......Oh?`
` .........I haven't a clue what this is about.`
` But very well, I will humor you.`
` Tell me the conditions."`
`"First.`
` ......The term successor to the head refers to the caregiver of the current head, Ushiromiya Kinzo."`
`".........Mhmm.`
` Go on?"`
`"Second.`
` The duty of the caregiver is to look after Ushiromiya Kinzo for the rest of his life.`
` ......To make things simple, the caregiver's job is to care for him until his final moments.`
` You were prepared to do that from the beginning, Krauss nii‐san, so there are no problems."`
`"Naturally.`
` I have no objections whatsoever to either of those conditions.`
` I am already carrying them out."`
`"Third.`
` In the remote chance that the caregiver is neglectful in his responsibilities of supervision, he will be stripped of his rights as a caregiver."`
`With that sentence, all slack disappeared from Krauss's face.`
`{n}...Natsuhi alone was still having trouble understanding what it meant.`
`"......Hoh.`
` And these "responsibilities of supervision" that the caregiver bears,`
` ......just what exactly are they?"`
`"It means supervising so that Father can live in good health until the end of his natural lifespan.`
` ......I'll go into more detail.`
` In the case that Father dies anything other than a natural death, the caregiver will be stripped of his rights as a caregiver, and will lose his rights as successor to the head.`
` In that situation, the next highest ranked, Eva nee‐san, is to be selected as the successor."`
`".........What...did you say......`
` H‐how dare you speak such nonsense!!"`
`"Hohoh.`
` My, my, a caregiver's responsibility is grave indeed..."`
`"However, people can die in many ways.`
` For example, the old and infirm sometimes die by getting food caught in their throats.`
` I have no doubt that this would ordinarily fall under the broad definition of death by old age."`
`"But with your argument, that would become a "death by accident", and I would be made to bear the responsibility as supervisor.`
` ......This is unjustly disadvantageous to me."`
`"I don't have the slightest intention of splitting hairs in such a way.`
` The kinds of things that I'm imagining are just things the caregiver could have prevented beforehand by taking good care of Father and keeping their eyes on him."`
`"It may be the caregiver's job to carry food to Father's mouth, but whether he swallows it down or not is clearly outside the caregiver's responsibility.`
` I have absolutely no problems with the case you raise, Krauss nii‐san."`
`".........Hoh.`
` Then what kind of case {i:do} you imagine would cause the caregiver to be blamed for making a blunder?"`
`"For example,`
` ......if he disappeared."`
`".....................`
` ...............Hoh?"`
`"Father seems to be of sound mind right now,`
` but he could lose the ability for rational thought and decision‐making at any moment, and it would come as no surprise."`
`"......He could wander around when you aren't looking and get into some kind of accident,`
` ......or he could get lost in the forest and go missing, never to be found again."`
`"......Isn't this type of case clearly the responsibility of the caregiver...?"`
`"Father's mind is perfectly healthy!`
` Of all things, what an outrageous...!"`
`"You might say that one day, suddenly, you saw Father go into the forest.`
` You chased after him, but you couldn't find him.`
` Despite calling the police and searching, seven years pass, unable to find him, and after that time a court declares him legally dead.`
` I am trying to say that we won't accept that kind of series of events."`
`"......................................."`
`"When Father passes away, an autopsy must be carried out,`
` and it must be verified that he died of old age in the most general meaning, within the bounds of common sense.`
` ......A death for any other reason will be held as the caregiver's responsibility."`
`".........See?`
` They're nothing more or less than the things you have already been toiling at up to today.`
` They aren't strange conditions or anything of the sort, right...?"`
`"Y‐you are mocking us, insulting us!!`
` I find it difficult to imagine why my husband must be coerced into a rule that disgraces him in this way!!"`
`".........Actually, I've been suspecting it since last year.`
` No, everyone here probably suspects it.`
` Eva nee‐san, Hideyoshi nii‐san.`
` Rudolf‐san, and Rosa‐san too.`
` Everyone has suspected it the whole time, but it was so dreadful to imagine that no one actually said it."`
`"Heh.`
` ......Heheheheh, hahahahaha...!!`
` I see, so {i:this} is what you're trying to say?`
` ......That Father is already dead, and that I have been hiding it!"`
`"......Yeah, that's right.`
` This is one of the theories I thought of as the key to solving the final mystery in the previous game."`
`".........You mean the last one in the previous game,`
` the mystery of who killed Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ......The witch definitely did say a lot in red.`
` ...She mentioned the names of all 18 people and announced whether they were alive or dead, and stated definitively that there are no more humans than that.`
` ......But with this theory, I can weave my way through that gap...!"`
`".....................`
` ......I see.`
` So this is one of the answers that don't cause those two to contradict.`
` .........I see."`
`"You understand what I'm getting at?`
` ...You catch on pretty quick, don't you.`
` It's nice that I don't have to explain."`
`"No 19th person exists on this island.`
` But this gimmick lets us mix in an unknown new person X despite that.`
` ......Basically, "the names of all 18 people" just have to not match "the 18 people on the island"."`
`"Exactly...!`
` In red, the witch mentioned the names of 18 people one after another, and announced whether they were alive or dead.`
` And on top of that, she declared that the number of humans on the island doesn't exceed 18.`
` ......There was a single illusion in there."`
`It was never guaranteed that {i:the 18 names = the 18 people on the island}.`
`"When she named off all 18 people and announced who was alive and who was dead,`
` she kept the name of the culprit X hidden, and instead mixed in someone who isn't on this island...!"`
`"By doing that, even though the culprit is on the island, she was able to leave him or her out of the list of the 18 alive or dead people!`
` The person who was mixed in isn't on the island, so he doesn't count towards the total number of people on the island."`
`"Therefore, even though the culprit counts towards the total of 18 people on the island, it was possible for his or her name to not be listed!`
` The two statements in red are completely independent, so this theory has no contradictions......!"`
`"The name which is used to hide the name of the culprit has several conditions to fulfill.`
` ......First of all, it has to be someone who isn't on the island, and yet whom we believe to be on the island.`
` ......Otherwise, she wouldn't be able to trick us."`
`"And it would be preferable for that person to be dead.`
` ......After all, no alibi exists that is more perfect than death.`
` Because the mystery at that point was based on the crime being impossible for all 18 people.`
` ............Something like that?"`
`"Yeah, that's it...!`
` And that person...`
`......was Grandfather.`
` ......What Kyrie‐san is trying to say right now is just one simple thing."`
`"......We're being told that Grandfather is locked up in his study, saying that he doesn't want to meet anyone,`
` ......but there is the possibility that he's actually already dead,`
` and that Uncle Krauss is lying when he claims that he's alive...!"`
`That's right.`
` Grandfather has been closed up in his room this whole time, and no one's seen his face!`
`Maybe he's already dead,`
` and Uncle Krauss and the rest are conspiring together to trick everyone into believing he's alive...!!`
`"............If Kinzo dies, the distribution of the inheritance occurs.`
` ...However, if Kinzo doesn't die,`
` ......no,`
` if he dies, but {i:it isn't announced}, the distribution of the inheritance doesn't occur."`
`"In other words, Uncle Krauss could have all of Grandfather's wealth to himself...!`
` That's right, he's got plenty of motive!"`
`Sure, maybe a 19th person X really doesn't exist on this island.`
`But the person X did exist.`
`{n}......And that person was the 18th person!`
`"In other words, there were originally 17 people on this island, not 18.`
` Then an unknown person X snuck in and committed the crime."`
`"......How's that, Beato?!`
` Get your ass out here, I've just solved the final, biggest mystery from the last game!!"`
`As Battler declared that forcefully, the crisp sound of clapping came out of nowhere, and their surroundings turned bright,`
` becoming the usual witch's tea room.`
`"*cackle*, hahahahahahaha...!`
` <Bravo, bravo>.`
` I cannot deny the sense of it being long overdue, but in any event, despite your incompetence, you have managed to produce a single answer."`
`"Cessation of thought is possible even for a lump of concrete!`
` So you have now finally evolved into a being with intelligence."`
`"......You could say that you've finally taken a step forward from the crying creature that you were before, just licking my shoes and grinding your teeth.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"......I can't believe I let this stupid wordplay make a fool of me in the last game.`
` My lameness pisses even me off!"`
`"Alright, Beato, time for a repetition request!!`
` Declare that Grandfather's included in the 18 people on the island, if you caaaaaan!!"`
`"Yeah, never in a million years.`
` Because he's already dead.`
` This is the end of your deceptiooooooooooon!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!`
` Well now, what to do here.`
` .........Shall I slice that in twain with the red truth?"`
`"No, no, it might also be good to hold back for now and let you get all excited.`
` If I'm going to push you off a cliff anyway, it would be much more interesting to lure you to a higher place first.`
` *cackle*!"`
`As Beato sneered obnoxiously, it even looked to me as if she was still searching for the perfect expression to tick me off even more.`
`As though she was saying that the answer I had finally reached was entirely too ridiculous.`
`In contrast to my visible annoyance with the witch's attitude, Gretel had a blank and composed expression on her face.`
`...Almost as though she had expected the witch would act that way.`
`"........................`
` I see.`
` ...So just like Battler learns and grows, so does the witch."`
`"What's wrong, Beato!`
` Quit stalling!!`
` Can you repeat it or not?!`
` Answer!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*..."`
`"......Stop it, Battler.`
` The witch won't answer so easily.`
` ......As long as she doesn't think it will benefit her."`
`"What?!`
` What do you mean......?"`
`"Because you've been at the mercy of this "red truth" in the games so far, the witch has used it over and over again."`
`"But now, the situation is different.`
` You are luring the red truth out, and are instead using it as your weapon.`
` In a situation like that, there's no way the witch will keep firing off the red without reason.`
` .........Right?"`
`"Gretel, or whoever you are.`
` ...It seems that you are quite sharp, unlike Battler.`
` I have welcomed in a fearsome enemy."`
`"That is correct!`
` When Battler is expecting me to use the red truth, why do I have a responsibility to answer to his expectations?!"`
`"I have no such thing!`
` I don't even have a crumb from that croissant you ate this morning's worth of responsibility to please yooooou!!"`
`"Y‐you bitch.........!!"`
`"Yes, yes, oh yes, that's the faaaaace!`
` I started playing with the red truth just because I wanted to see that face!`
` If I cannot witness that expression of yours, then I have no reason whatsoever to play around...!"`
`"......Heheh.`
` You're just being a sore loser, aren't you?`
` If you think you can just say a bunch of crap to trick me because you can't respond to my repetition request, it's not gonna work!!"`
`"Don't be so full of yourself!!`
` An answer like that, I could cut into pieces with no trouble at all!!`
` But I will deliberately refuse to speak in red.`
` I will refuse to speak because that is what you want.`
` Do you understand why?"`
`"............You just said it.`
` You want to push him off at the sweetest spot.`
` This ill‐natured witch is saying that she won't use the red anywhere you ask for it any more."`
`"In other words, she won't play along with your game of repetition requests any more."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Exactly, exactly!`
` Unlike Battler, everything goes quickly with this woman, there's never a need to explain!`
` I will speak as I like with the red truth, at the time that I desire!"`
`"Yes.`
` The use of the red truth is basically a {i:right} the witch has, to exercise as she pleases.`
` It's not a responsibility that she has to fulfill at whatever time the human side desires.`
` ...............But that depends on the details."`
`"......The details......?`
` What do you mean...?"`
`"The witch has no responsibility to respond to your repetition requests.`
` But when and only when your claim would destroy the witch theory, it {i:does} become her responsibility.`
` Because in this court without a judge, that which is not refuted becomes the "truth"."`
`"......In just the same way that whenever you've stopped thinking,`
` and been unable to make a counterargument against the witch theory asserted by the witch, it has immediately become truth."`
`"Then, ...since she doesn't have a counterargument to my reasoning, that means it's right?!`
` I'm correct in my deduction that the culprit is the mysterious 18th person X, and Grandfather is already dead?!"`
`"......At least, until the witch argues back.`
` Truth loses to new truths farther in the future.`
` ......The tricky part is that even the timing of the counterargument is up to the witch."`
`"...In other words, maybe your reasoning just now is correct,`
` or maybe the witch is holding off on arguing back even though you're mistaken."`
`"......Or else, the witch may be ignoring it because it doesn't shake the basis of the witch theory in the first place.`
` The point is, we can't tell the difference at the current time.`
` .........Is that more or less it?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Damn you, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, for throwing in such a troublesome piece.`
` Thanks to that, I'm losing all my lines!"`
`"The witch has learned to respond to your repetition requests at a separate time.`
` ......Maybe you could also call it a "delay"."`
`"......G‐goddamn her......`
` ...So even if I offer some mistaken reasoning, there's a possibility that Beato will intentionally let me flounder about without disproving it,`
` and at the very end, after I've built it up even more into some grand expansive theory, she can chop it off at the base,`
` and turn everything over......?!"`
`A single piece of reasoning becomes a bridge to the next piece.`
`{n}Through my repetition requests, I've been able to strengthen my position and advance bit by bit.`
`But thanks to that damned Beato learning this strange delay tactic,`
` ......I can no longer confirm or deny my reasoning.`
`It's like I finally got myself a cane to help me search around in the pitch‐black darkness, and now I've had it taken away from me.`
` ......Now I'm just...stuck, aren't I......?!!`
`"Now, now, Battler, if you make a despairing face like that, I won't be able to stop drooling, you knowwww{p:0:♪}`
` From the beginning, that cane was nothing more than something I gave you because you were so ineffectual."`
`"This just means that you can finally challenge me without a handicap, right?`
` Kuhhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!"`
`"......But that doesn't change the fact that repetition requests are one of Battler's methods for fighting back.`
` As I already said, as long as it's something fatal that would destroy the witch theory,`
` the witch is obligated to argue back, and therefore, to speak with the red truth."`
`"......While the timing of that counterargument is up to the witch, it must be performed eventually.`
` .........Right?"`
`"Hmm, that would seem to follow.`
` If I cannot deny the "tricks done by humans" theory Battler lays out by the time the game ends,`
` Battler will use that as a reason to deny me, and it will be possible for him to proclaim his victory."`
`".........So, then, the "trick theory" laid out by the human side,`
` in other words, his repetition requests, must be countered during the game, i.e., during the episode—we can view this as a restriction on the witch side to that effect?"`
`"That is so.`
` ......Battler's goal is to show that he can explain with humans the entire pleasant game I have laid out on this island and deny me.`
` If Battler succeeds in that, at that time, Battler shall become the victor of this game."`
`"Let me confirm the rules.`
` ......Am I OK to interpret "the time the game ends" as referring to 24:00 on October 5th, 1986, going by the time of the Rokkenjima in the game?"`
`"There are no problems with that."`
`"If, at the time the game ends, the human side can assert a trick theory for all of the mysteries,`
` {i:and} there is no counterargument from the witch side, then the human side can declare victory.`
` ......Any problems?"`
`".........Let us be a little more rigorous.`
` At the time the game ends, the witch side shall be given the opportunity to argue back."`
`"I'll set a time limit on that.`
` One minute.`
` If the counterargument is not carried out within one minute, victory will be declared."`
`"Then allow me to impose the same rule on you.`
` At the time the game ends, the human side will be given one minute to counter the mysteries it has been given.`
` If there is even a single mystery that has not been countered within that time, it becomes a victory for the witch side, and that game is over."`
`"......It would spoil things terribly to have the game stopped for lengthy consideration, you see."`
`"............Goddamn you both.`
` Moving things along without me...`
` But I more or less get what's going on.`
` So even if my repetition requests aren't countered instantly, they must be countered eventually."`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` ......And that must happen before 00:01 on October 6th."`
`"......But be careful.`
` The witch only has to cut up a single one of your repetition requests.`
` You can't declare victory unless you can solve all of the mysteries."`
`"Just as I can use the red,`
` Battler, from now on, I will permit you to use the blue."`
`"When explaining my magical murders with human tricks, you can make declarations in blue.`
` I will be under obligation to counter your blue with the red by the end of the game."`
`"Blue......`
` ......So basically, I'll speak my repetition requests in blue...?"`
`"Not exactly.`
` It was possible to use repetition requests for anything, no matter how trivial.`
` But the blue is a little more restrictive.`
` It is only valid if it denies witches on its own."`
`"..........................."`
`It's starting to get confusing, ...but it's more or less something like this.`
`Let's take one of the repetition requests I made during a past mystery as an example.`
`{n}"The number of master keys is five".`
`It had been claimed that there were only five master keys, so I made this request to confirm that the number really was five.`
`But since that by itself doesn't deny the witch, I can't say it in blue.`
` So, in order to speak in blue, I would need to say something like this.`
`{i:"The actual number of master keys was greater than five.`
` The culprit used one of those extra keys to get in and out of the room!"}`
`......And only then would the witch, who claims that it was a locked‐room murder with magic, be responsible for making a counterargument.`
` In other words, I can't use it to demand that she repeats things in order to check the premises of my reasoning.`
`.........That will probably put me at a significant disadvantage.`
`Crap...`
` It's enough to make me think that all those red declarations that Beato's been making to toy with me were extremely merciful......`
`"...Damn it.`
` That means, even if I create a theory for a particular locked room and speak it in blue,`
` if Beato denies it at the very, very end, I won't even have time to create my next theory...!`
` This rule is awful... It's all disadvantage for me and me alone..."`
`".........Are you going to surrender before the fight begins again?`
` Calm down.`
` No one's said that you can only use the blue once for each mystery.`
` Do you understand what that means?"`
`"N‐no.`
` ......What does it mean...?"`
`"In the pitiful way you've been fighting up until now, you've made a single theory, gauged the witch's reaction,`
` and if that one didn't work, you'd then start making another theory.`
` You won't corner a witch like that."`
`"Then how am I meant to fight......`
` .........You don't mean—"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` ......You don't challenge the mysteries with an individual point.`
` {i:You assault them with a wall}.`
` You said yourself in an earlier game that that's what the attitude behind reasoning should be like."`
`Assault...with a wall.`
` That's right, I said so myself before.`
`The act of trying to uncover the mystery by reasoning is like trying to shoot a distant target with an arrow.`
`Until now, I've been shooting off a single flimsy arrow every time,`
` asking the witch if I scored a hit,`
` and then, once told that I missed, preparing my bow again, and shooting off another flimsy arrow.`
`There's no way I'll hit at that rate...`
`{n}Bullets might be a better example than arrows.`
`If you take one shot after another at a distant target with a handgun, you probably won't hit it easily.`
`......So how can you hit it?`
`If a handgun doesn't work,`
` ......use a shotgun!`
` Instead of a single bullet, blast her with "shot" filled with countless projectiles at once...!`
`Shot scatters, so it impacts a wide area.`
` So it's very well suited for shooting small, fast targets like birds.`
`That's right, there's no rule that says reasoning has to be like a pistol, shooting one shot off at a time.`
`......Making a single theory and just hoping that it hits is like stopping your own thinking.`
`Blast away with a massive number of bullets, of pieces of reasoning, and make them impact like a wall, so you only need just one of them to find its mark.`
`"............Blue, huh...`
` ......I get it.`
` If your red truth is a razor‐sharp katana, then it looks like my blue is a shotgun.`
` No, ......a machine‐gun with firepower enough to honeycomb witches."`
`"He that is always shooting must something something.`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` That sort of crude analogy is just like you."`
`"The climax of a detective novel is always the same.`
` ......The great and famous detective gathers all the suspects in one place, and unveils a single trail of logic which is proven correct in spectacular fashion."`
`"Almost like William Tell expertly shooting through an apple with a single arrow.`
` That's why I mistakenly thought of it like a virtue."`
`......Sure, that probably would be magnificent.`
`{n}If I could shoot through the truth with a single guess.`
`But that isn't realistic.`
`Just look at real wars.`
` Do I really think everyone pulls long guns out of the trench, aims reeeeeally well, and takes a single shot at a time at the other side?`
`They don't, right?!`
` They fire rapidly, they fire all over the place, they pin down the enemy with a barrage!`
`Reasoning was the same way.`
`Because of that weird virtue, I had been stuck thinking that I could only take one line of reasoning at a time.`
`We humans can fire off countless guesses and possibilities!`
`Imagination is ammunition.`
` Suspension of thought is a clogged barrel...!`
`{n}The pathetic way I've been reasoning up until now is like a peashooter.`
`Incredibly awkward, like I've been weakly firing off a shot, getting it denied in red, and then receiving the next bullet and reloading.`
`My "blue truth" that claims that human tricks are the truth...`
`...will overwhelm its target, the fantasy told by the witch, with all the firepower of my imagination...!`
`This is my...`
`Ushiromiya Battler‐style way of fighting...!`
`".........Thanks to you, I've figured out the real way to fight.`
` Thanks, Gretel!!"`
`"You're welcome."`
`"It's enough to make me think how pathetic I was before.`
` ......Yeah, it's like Beato said.`
` I've had the benefit of a handicap up until now.`
` I'll acknowledge that...!!`
` New rule, understood!!`
` I have my own way to fight!`
` And I'll show it to you!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` Excellent spirit, I like it!`
` Then try using it right away, this blue truth of yours...!!"`
`"......I'll use it, all right.`
` With this blue truth, I can break apart your witch theory, which states that only a witch culprit was possible because everyone had alibis!!"`
`"This is my truth!`
` {p:2:Ushiromiya Kinzo is already dead}.`
` {p:2:Therefore, the true number of people on the island is 17}!`
` {p:2:By adding an unknown person X to that, it becomes 18 people}.`
` {p:2:By supposing that this person X exists, the crime is possible even if all 17 people have alibis}!!"`
`"......In short, if you keep preventing us from meeting with Father, we will have to form the following theory.`
` Simply: Father is already dead.`
` But you are hiding that because you don't want the inheritance to be distributed. See?"`
`"....................................`
` ...Ridiculous."`
`"Th‐that is correct, this is worse than ridiculous!!`
` I have never been so insulted!!"`
`"It's even possible for us to force you to allow us to check whether he's alive or dead in the presence of the police.`
` Isn't it, Eva nee‐san...?"`
`"......Y‐......yes...`
` That's right, Nii‐san.`
` We could come up with any number of excuses for it.`
` We could easily set it up so that you have to arrange a meeting with Father under the supervision of a third party...!"`
`"Still.`
` I think that would be very shameful for the Ushiromiya family."`
`"That's why I'm making this proposal.`
` The responsibilities and duties of the caregiver.`
` A penalty in the worst‐case scenario.`
` If you consent to that, we will be able to refrain from doing something like dragging Father outside."`
`"...Yeah, that's right, Aniki...`
` Didn't you just say it...?`
` You are carrying out your natural duties as Father's caregiver.`
` Kyrie's conditions shouldn't be anything to worry about, right?`
` Why the overreaction?"`
`"......Are you really that worried about having your position of successor dragged out from under you if Dad dies something other than a natural death?"`
`"Or whaaaat?`
` Do you have an idea of some way Father could die other than a natural death...?"`
`"Of course I don't.`
` ......I see, now I too understand how Father feels.`
` What pitiful final years, unable to even die as he pleases."`
`"Yes, truly pitiful final years.`
` ......And what we suspect is that those "final years" are already in the past."`
`"......You could completely clear this suspicion just by letting us meet with Father.`
` ...So even after all this humiliation, you still won't allow us to meet with him, Krauss nii‐san.........?"`
`"................................."`
`"Father is probably already dead.`
` You disposed of the body in absolute secrecy, most likely.`
` ......And after taking all of the wealth for yourself as Father's agent,`
` you will make it so that he "disappeared" and spend seven years making Father a corpseless member of the deceased."`
`"............I'm sorry, please don't take it badly, alright?`
` I'm just playing detective here."`
`"H‐......how rude can one be!!`
` You have no right to stay in this mansion!!`
` Leave immediately!!`
` I will never again permit you to cross the threshold of this house!!"`
`"It worked last year, but you've used up your luck if you thought it would work this year too.`
` ......Father is in a bad mood, so he can't meet with us?`
` That was plenty suspicious last year, and yet you do it again this year."`
`"If you wanted to fake being Father's agent and grab up all his assets, you should have done it a little more speedily,`
` and made him disappear without waiting for today's family conference.`
` You really are naive, Krauss onii‐sama......"`
`"............I have no idea what you are—"`
`"However!`
` ......If it is a fact that Father is in a bad mood,`
` and you are preventing us from meeting him as part of your responsibilities as his caregiver, that is a very virtuous thing to do.`
` In that case, if you just accept the conditions I've provided, everything will be settled here and now."`
`".........After all, you care so greatly for Father, Krauss nii‐san.`
` There's no way that Father will die in a manner that leads to trouble during the autopsy."`
`"Father hates hospitals in any case, so he'll pass away in his study, right?`
` An autopsy will certainly be carried out in any event.`
` ......The only way to {i:kill him without an autopsy} would be for him to disappear."`
`".........Kyrie‐san. I wonder if you would mind not bullying Nii‐san so much...?"`
`Eva rebuked Kyrie in an sickeningly kind voice.`
`...Considering the situation, that was impossible.`
`{n}Which is why it was so sickening...`
`"Nii‐san must have all kinds of situations of his own to deal with, as well as his pride.`
` Even though it may be an obvious duty to Nii‐san,`
` if we put it down on paper and even assign penalties,`
` ...that's bound to be unpleasant for him.`
` Don't you agree, Rosa......?"`
`"......Yes, that's right.`
` .........We might have made light of Krauss nii‐san's pride as the eldest son too much.`
` ......It might be a bit cruel to make him sign a memorandum regarding the duties of the caregiver as Kyrie‐san suggests."`
`"Yeah, I agree.`
` You're doing a good job, Aniki.`
` Taking that into account, all that stuff about signing strange papers and worst‐case penalties,`
` it might be possible for us to consider skipping all that and just leaving everything to you."`
`"Y‐............you people............"`
`Not just Eva, but Rudolf and Rosa as well began closing in on Krauss, with unnerving smiles on their faces as though they had planned this beforehand.`
`They now understood perfectly how Kyrie had cornered Krauss, and exactly where she was prepared to compromise...`
`"......The memorandum regarding the responsibilities of the caregiver.`
` You can make it so that you don't need to sign, and we will never demand a meeting with Father again.`
` ......If you can guarantee that you are fit to be the caregiver even without the document, that is."`
`"Are you telling me.........to pay security money?`
` Hehheheheh, hahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!`
` This is ludicrous!`
` Wahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!"`
`"The security money, paid to Eva‐san, Rudolf‐san, and Rosa‐san, will be 3 billion yen each.`
` As a deposit, you will transfer ten percent of that, 300 million yen each, before the year is out."`
`"9 billion?!`
` I don't have that kind of money!!!"`
`"After Father passes away, you should be able to work it out.`
` Our investigations have told us at least that much.`
` And even the deposit of 900 million yen, you should be able to manage in your current financial situation."`
`"And it should even be possible for you to {i:borrow it from Father}, right?`
` ...There's no need for this obvious charade."`
`"............H‐how unpleasant.`
` Truly unpleasant...!!"`
`"I‐it is at that!!`
` And it was disrespectful enough just with the discussion of Father's inheritance!`
` Father is already dead?`
` My husband is hiding that and keeping all the money to himself?!"`
`"I have had enough of this!!`
` None of you are qualified to bear the name Ushiromiya any longer!!"`
`"Calm down, Natsuhi‐san...!`
` And the rest of you, that's enough talk for now!`
` Why don't we just leave it at that for the time bein', huh...?!`
` This is a big ol' topic, and sudden, too.`
` We might be gettin' a little worked up ourselves!"`
`"Why don't we take a break for a while and cool our heads?`
` Krauss nii‐san probably needs a little time himself.`
` Right, Krauss‐san?"`
`"......Time...?`
` And why would I need something like that?"`
`"OK, OK, OK!`
` Look, deep down, none of us are actually thinkin' anythin' serious like that!`
` It just seemed like you weren't goin' to let us see Father no matter what, so we felt like makin' a few bitter comments, that's all...!"`
`"And Krauss‐san, the things we said made you angry and you argued back on instinct, I know reeeeal well what that's like...!`
` That's not how you really feel either, you're actually thinkin' fine, I'll let you see him if you're goin' to be that pig‐headed about it!"`
`"Right?`
` Isn't that right?`
` But after all we've said, you just couldn't help gettin' stubborn, and now you're havin' trouble sayin' it's alright to see him, that's all.`
` Isn't that it?`
` Right? Right?"`
`"......I‐...it certainly does seem that, like the rest of you, my husband has slightly lost his composure.`
` ......We are firmly refusing only out of respect for Father's desire not to meet with you all."`
`".....................`
` ......Hmm, that's right.`
` It just started turning into another sibling fight like the old days, and I grew stubborn as well.`
` .........Let us cool our heads."`
`"...I understand now how strongly you all desire to meet with Father.`
` ...I will pass that on to him.`
` .........I will find some way of convincing him so that he will see you.`
` .........How is that?"`
`"......Right.`
` I think it's alright to give Krauss nii‐san some time to persuade Father."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......We're counting on you, Aniki.`
` Please do a good job of persuading him so that he'll meet with us.`
` After all, you're Dad's caregiver."`
`"About persuading him...let's set a limit on it to sometime tonight, alright?`
` When tomorrow comes, we'll confirm Father's well‐being, even if we have to break down the door to his study.`
` .........You have no problems with that, right?`
` Nii‐san...?"`
`"......Do as you like.`
` I see, it seems that I am not even given much time to persuade him.`
` ......Come on, Natsuhi.`
` We shall ask him to at least be with us for dinner."`
`"Y‐yes...!"`
`Krauss left the parlor accompanied by Natsuhi.`
`Once their footsteps disappeared,`
` Hideyoshi breathed out heavily, and flopped onto a sofa, smirking...`
`"............Kyrie‐san.`
` ...You are...a frightening person."`
`"Sorry for speaking out of turn.`
` I apologize."`
`"......No, no, you cornered him in a different way from the original plan, but in the end, this was even better.`
` ...Just like always, I have to bow my head to you..."`
`"But...can he really prepare 900 million yen......?`
` We estimated that 750 million would be the most Krauss nii‐san could afford with his current financial situation...`
` ......Isn't 900 million gouging him too much...?"`
`"It's alright if it's impossible for him.`
` If we do something like lowering it to 750 million so Krauss nii‐san can save face, it will look like we're compromising and it'll be easier to settle, right?`
` And if he really does come out with 900 million, that's even better."`
`"Nii‐san is probably having a strategy meeting with Natsuhi‐san about now.`
` ......It will be truly interesting to see what kind of twisted logic our proud Nii‐san comes up with as an excuse."`
`"Convince Father......?`
` There's no way he can."`
`There's no way to convince someone who doesn't even exist...!`
`"..................All my siblings have taken time out of their schedules to come here to this annual family conference."`
`Krauss and Natsuhi could be seen in Kinzo's dimly lit study.`
`Every once in a while, thunder could be heard, and the dimly lit room flickered with light.`
` ......It seemed that the island would be closed off by the storm very soon.`
`"......Father...!`
` Please, just this once, show those disrespectful people the majesty of the head...!"`
`"It's no good........."`
`The large figure standing by the window, his majestic back facing them,`
` quietly yet forcefully...gave his answer.`
`His head was hung slightly, and he appeared to be trembling.`
` ...Eventually, a mumbling laugh reached them from over his shoulder.`
`"Heh‐heh‐heh‐heh‐heh‐heh, hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!`
` It's no good, it's no goddamn good at all...!!`
` Wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`.........Three months left to live...?`
` A senile old man not long for this world...?`
`{n}Just who are you referring to?`
`"Brain‐dead fooool!!`
` Your siblings intimidated you, so you come crawling over here, is that it?`
` You are a disgrace!!"`
`As Kinzo spun around and brandished his cloak, a blast of wind shook up the stale air inside the room.`
`That air pressure expressed clearly the majesty and willpower of Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
`It was no wonder at all that Krauss landed on his backside, as if that pressure had literally blown him to the ground.`
`As though showing consideration for Krauss, who looked as though his legs had been swept out from under him, Natsuhi also crouched down.`
`Then,`
` ......with a thunk,`
` ......and another thunk,`
` Kinzo's footsteps approached with a heft that signified his majesty.`
`"F‐......Father........."`
`"Yoou fooooooooool......!!`
` I heard it all from Kanon, just how pathetically your siblings made you dance like a puppet!!!!"`
`"F‐Father...!`
` My husband is doing his best to protect your honor—"`
`Without lending an ear to Natsuhi's words, Kinzo extended his palm to Krauss's collar, as the latter sat on the floor.`
`...No, he curled up his fingers, leaving only his index finger out, and then, with that one remaining finger.........`
`he pressed hard into Krauss's collar,`
` ......twisted it,`
` ..................and slowly,`
` with just one finger,`
` ......he raised Krauss high into the air.`
`"...Truly, what a pathetic creature you aaaare.`
` ......You even need your wife to speak in your defense?`
` If you have an excuse, man up and show me you can give it yourself!!"`
`"Ggggg, .....................gahahhk......!!"`
`Krauss's feet scrabbled at the air.`
`Kinzo's brawny finger was choking him.`
`{n}He couldn't even open his mouth, much less talk.`
`However, even if he had been allowed to open his mouth,`
` as he was now, there was no way he would be able to think up an excuse that Kinzo would accept...`
`Still, ......what incredible power he possessed...`
`{n}No one would call Kinzo an old man after seeing this superhuman strength...`
`"......Father...!!`
` My husband, he has his own way of fighting...!!`
` I beg you to forgive him...!!"`
`"............Natsuhii.`
` ......Fighting is the process you undergo before you achieve victory.`
` ......You cannot call it fighting if it ends in a loss."`
`"Just one word, we call that humiliation!!`
` Wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha, and {i:this} is my successor?`
` Wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha, wahhah{0}hahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}haaaaaaah!!"`
`As thunder roared, Kinzo laughed heartily as though there could be nothing more amusing.`
`And at the end of his laugh, he threw his feckless son away like he was scrap paper,`
` slamming him against the wall...`
`"Ghaghh, ......uuuuuuuuunnghh......"`
`"My love, my love...!! Just breathe......"`
`Krauss slid down the wall, rubbing his throat in pain...`
`{n}Natsuhi ran up to him and cared for him...`
`But Kinzo showed no interest in the two of them,`
` and he returned to the space near the window, as though he had been there the whole time, and looked up at the ominous thunderclouds.`
`"............I thought that as long as I could meet {f:5:Beatrice}, I would have no regrets in my life,`
` but it seems that things won't go so smoothly."`
`"......It was promised from the beginning that nothing received from the witch would remain.`
` However, the Ushiromiya name is not the property of the witch."`
`"......Who is fit to succeed that name?`
` It seems that this alone must be resolved by my own hand.`
` ......Rejoice, Krauss!!`
` I have changed my mind."`
`".........F‐Father...`
` .........Then you'll......?"`
`"I have no desire to have dinner with you cowards.`
` However, I will attend the family conference afterwards!"`
`"F‐Father...`
` Thank you very much......!"`
`"There, I shall make an important announcement regarding the succession of the headship.`
` I will resolve your foolish quarrel myself!!`
` Uuhhahahahahahaha, waaahah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!!"`
`The door was forcefully flung open, and Rosa flew in with Maria.`
`"Is Genji‐san or anyone here...?!`
` It doesn't matter who, someone bring us a bath towel...!!"`
`It was already a full‐blown typhoon outside, and it was starting to pour down hard.`
`{n}Though she had at least been using an umbrella, Maria had been in the rose garden amid all that wind and rain the whole time.`
`She had grown ice‐cold.`
`Maria had gotten into a minor fight with Rosa in the rose garden, and had been told to stay there forever.`
`......She had done as she was told, and had continued to remain in that spot even after the rain started.`
`Rosa certainly had gotten a little emotional and angry,`
` but Maria's stubborn demands were probably more at fault.`
`......The cousins, who had unfortunately been witness to that exchange,`
` were relieved to see the mother and child close to each other again.`
`Rosa towelled Maria's head dry.`
` She seemed overcome with worry that Maria might catch a cold, but Maria herself was nonchalant.`
`"Are you alright?`
` You didn't catch a chill, did you?`
` Maybe we really should go back quickly and get a change of clothes..."`
`"Uu, I'm fiiiine!`
` And I'm hungry, so food is better than change of clothes, uu!"`
`"Hahahaha.`
` She seems fine, Auntie Rosa.`
` She's gotta be alright if she's got that much bounce."`
`"It's a really good thing she had an umbrella.`
` ......I was thinking she might be soaked to the bone.`
` The fact that she was holding on to an umbrella is one consolation, at least."`
`"But Maria!`
` Even if you've got an umbrella, you have to get some shelter if it starts pelting down like this, got it?`
` Little girls shouldn't ever let themselves get cold."`
`".........Uu."`
`"It's alright, Jessica‐chan.`
` ......It's Mama's fault for telling her to stay there.`
` I'm really sorry, I'm really sorry...!!"`
`"Uu!`
` I'm a good girl?`
` Good girl for doing what Mama said?`
` Stayed there even though it was cold, stayed there until Mama came!`
` Uu‐uu!"`
`"Yes, you really are a good girl, Maria.`
` You did exactly what Mama told you...`
` You really did well.`
` But next time, even if Mama tells you to do something, you find some shelter if it starts raining like that.`
` Alright...?`
` Promise Mama."`
`"Uu.`
` Promise Mama.`
` ......Uu{p:0:☆}"`
`As Rosa gently held Maria, they joined their pinkies together and promised.`
`Battler and the others could tell that by this bonding between mother and child, expressed through a single little finger,`
` the warmth was starting to return to Maria's body.`
`"Kanon‐kun, thanks for the towel.`
` That really helped."`
`"......Then, if you would excuse me."`
`Kanon bowed with a blank expression, as though he had done nothing that required gratitude, then left the parlor.`
`"......Alright, it's already dinnertime.`
` Let's all go together.`
` ......Maria, you can even have half of my dessert too for being so good."`
`"Uu!`
` Really, Mama?!`
` Uu‐uu, get dessert, uu‐uu‐uu{p:0:♪}`
` Love you Mama, love you Mama!"`
`"Now now, Maria, don't jump around.`
` Mama loves you too, Maria.`
` Love you Maria, love you Maria."`
`"Me too, love you Mama, love you Mama!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu{p:0:♪}"`
`Rosa and Maria looked really happy together.`
` Even the cousins watching started to feel a somehow familiar warmth filling up their chests.`
`"......You know, that might be the age when you're on the best terms with your parents."`
`"It wasn't like that for me.`
` Like Mom and stuff, always yelling at me to study, study, study."`
`"That's because they love their children.`
` A parent's love isn't always gentle and indulgent.`
` My mother was strict with me too, but by now I realize that it was because she treasured me so."`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!`
` Love you Mama, love you Mama!"`
`"Love you Maria, love you Maria{p:0:♪} So, shall we get some food?`
` Let's be friends and hold hands."`
`"Uu!`
` Be friends and hold hands!`
` Mama and Maria, friendly friendly{p:0:♪}"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` Mama and Maria are friends.`
` Forever and ever.`
` I love you, Maria..."`
`"...............The hell was that?`
` ...What happened?"`
`The sudden sound had come from the teacup Gretel had been holding, which had fallen and smashed.`
`".........Sorry.`
` I was out of it for a moment.`
` Sorry for dropping it."`
`The cup on the floor was broken into tiny pieces.`
`......Would it really have made such a sound and smashed into so many pieces just by being dropped from that height?`
`Even someone as obtuse as Battler could realize that she was in a bad mood over something,`
` but he couldn't understand why she had suddenly grown so displeased.`
`When she made to bend over and pick up the pieces of the cup, Ronove appeared out of nowhere and stopped her.`
`"Please, you will injure yourself.`
` Leave the cleaning‐up to me.`
` Shall I bring you another cup...?"`
`"......No thanks.`
` .........I guess a demon's black tea just doesn't suit my tastes."`
`"Hoh.`
` To think that there is someone whose tastes aren't satisfied even by Ronove's tea.`
` I must respect your discerning palate."`
`".........I'm getting bored, so I'll go out for a bit."`
`"{i:Bored}?`
` Wait a sec, but things are just about to get started.`
` At this point, Maria's probably going to say that she got an umbrella and a letter from {f:5:Beatrice} again, you know?`
` This is the critical part—"`
`"You'll have to excuse me.`
` Sorry, someone clean up this mess."`
`"Leave it to me."`
`Without saying anything else, Gretel disappeared of her own accord.`
` Her form literally melted and disappeared into thin air...`
`There had definitely been a displeased expression on her face.`
`But neither Battler nor Ronove, nor of course Beato either, could understand why her mood had so suddenly worsened.`
`All that remained was the fragrance of the black tea she had spilled...`
`.........It felt very unpleasant.`
`No, to be even more blunt, it made my skin crawl.`
`"Uu...?`
` ......Why are you so irritated, Ange......?"`
`"{i:Why}?!`
` Isn't it obvious...?"`
`"Uu.`
` ...Not to me......"`
`Even Maria onee‐chan, with that blank expression on her face, ...irritated me.`
`I held my hands palms‐up in the empty air, and from out of nowhere, a single book landed upon them with a thump.`
`.........It was Maria onee‐chan's diary.`
`Even though there was no wind, the pages flipped and flipped without me turning them,`
` and opened the door to Maria onee‐chan's world.`
`"......Why do you think that I'm not happy, Ange?"`
`"............By thinking about it objectively."`
`"Objectively from your perspective, right?"`
`".....................`
` ......Are you trying to say that the truth is different for me and you?"`
`"Truth changes its form depending on the observer.`
` And observers from the future always overwrite that form.`
` .........Ange, what do you want with my happiness...?"`
`".............................."`
`The pages of the diary were flipped through at greater and greater speeds...`
`{n}Then a brilliant light poured out from the depths of the diary, ......swallowing everything up and painting over it all with white.`
`".........Sorry, Maria.`
` Mama has a mountain of work that needs to be urgently taken care of, so I'm going to be confined to my workplace for a while.`
` ......I probably won't be able to come back home until late at night the day after tomorrow."`
`"......Uu.`
` ......Then, what about the promise to go to the movies together on Sunday......?"`
`"The movies...?`
` Uhh—"`
`Judging by Rosa's tone, she had clearly forgotten that promise.`
`But Maria's response to that was an apology for asking...`
`............I'm sorry.`
`Maria apologized for troubling her mother by asking that question......`
`".........I'll stay home.`
` I'll behave myself and wait.`
` ......I'll take a bath every day and change my underwear."`
`"...I know where the money is.`
` ......I'll go to a different store every day.`
` I'll make sure not to go out too late.`
` If a policeman asks, I'll say I'm running errands for Mama.`
` ......I'll say it just like you told me to."`
`"...........................`
` ......That's right.`
` You be a good girl.`
` If you're good, I'll buy you a present.`
` Listen now.`
` Go to bed by nine o'clock.`
` Make sure not to tell your teacher or any grown‐ups that Mama hasn't come home.`
` Alright......?"`
`"..................'kay.`
` ......I will, so, Mama, work hard, okay?`
` ......Work hard, finish your work......and come back as fast as you can..."`
`"I......won't cry during the night and annoy the neighbors anymore......`
` ......So, come back soon........."`
`"..................`
` ......Well then, I'm busy, so I'll hang up now.`
` ...Be a good girl and wait patiently.`
` Don't do anything foolish.`
` See you."`
`Click.`
` ......Using a tone that indicated she was wrapping up the call, Rosa hung up the phone without waiting for Maria's answer.`
`Maria neatly set down the receiver and returned to the sofa.`
`{n}There sat the stuffed animal Sakutaro, who had been watching TV with her until a second ago.`
`Sakutaro was clutching the remote control to the TV.`
`{n}......She had turned off the TV temporarily because of the phone call.`
`He looked like he was asking her to turn the power on again because he wanted to quickly get back to watching TV.`
`"...............Sakutaro.`
` ......Did you want to watch...TV?"`
`‘......Uryu?`
` You don't want to watch anymore, Maria...?`
` If the entertainers' team gets all the questions right, they might turn everything around.`
` Uryu~!’`
`".........No.`
` .........That's enough...TV."`
`Again, ......Mama's busy with her work and isn't coming home.`
`Mama usually has a lot of overtime and doesn't come home until late.`
`......She has to socialize or something for work, so she comes home having drunk a lot of alcohol, even though she can't handle it,`
` and with a pale face, she goes straight into the shower and then to bed.`
`And even on the weekends, she says she has overtime or has to stay over, and almost never comes home.`
`......This has been happening often recently, saying she has a big job lined up or something...`
`......The picture I did my best on during art class got laughed at by everyone,`
` but I wanted Mama to look at it properly at least...but once again, I won't be able to show her.`
`And talk about the time when everyone pushed the cleanup onto me, but I did my best by myself and got praised by the teacher.`
`And talk about when I went shopping, and the man at the shop said he's always impressed by me and gave me a free can of coffee.`
`And there's the card I wrote and secretly hid under Mama's pillow,`
` because I wanted to encourage her when she comes home from working so hard.`
`"...............And there's more, there's...so much......I wanted to talk about."`
`‘.........Mama is working really hard at her job.`
` She's working with all of her strength so we can eat every day.’`
`"......Hate jobs.`
` ......Mama should just quit that stupid job."`
`‘A job is an important thing for adults to do.`
` ......It lets you eat food,`
` buys clothes,`
` pays for school lunches,`
` and pays the deposit for summer camp.`
` ......It's all because Mama works and earns money for you.’`
`"..............................`
` ...Don't need food.`
` Don't need clothes.`
` Don't need school lunches and don't want to go to summer camp.`
` ...It's not like any of the groups will let me join in."`
`‘Uryu......`
` ......Just now, on the phone, Mama promised that she'll buy you a present for when she comes back from work, right?’`
`‘I think Mama made that promise because you're important to her, Maria,`
` and she feels bad for making you lonely.’`
`".........I don't know."`
`‘Uryu!`
` She definitely wouldn't do that if she thought you were a pain or annoying!`
` ......She wants to stay by your side all the time as well.’`
`‘...She also finds it painful and sad that she can't.`
` ............I remember when Mama spent the whole night by your side, crying.’`
`".........Yeah.`
` ...Didn't understand why Mama was crying, ......but seeing Mama like that was so sad,`
` ...and I couldn't do anything but stay silent by her side."`
`‘I remember the last thing Mama said then.`
` ......She said thank you.`
` .........She said that just by being by her side, you were her only ally in the whole world.`
` ......Uryu, do you remember?’`
`"Yeah...`
` .........You're my only ally in the whole wide world,`
` ......she said."`
`Sakutaro set the remote on the table, crawled up onto the sofa,`
` sat on my lap, ...and spoke to me while gazing into my eyes.`
`‘......I'm sure Mama's just like you, Maria.`
` .........Where the designs Mama draws are the only ones laughed at by the clients.`
` ......And her company is the only one that has annoying jobs pushed onto it by other companies.’`
`‘Mama is the president, so she has to take care of everything all by herself.`
` ......And her company is the only one that never gets to join in with the business of other companies.’`
`‘.........You're Mama's only ally, remember.`
` ......If even you tell Mama to quit her job, ......in the whole wide world, where would Mama's ally be.........?’`
`"...............uu...`
` .........Sakutaro......"`
`‘The only person I have in the whole world is you.`
` ......And the only person Mama has in the whole world is you.`
` .........What about you, Maria?’`
`"......I have Mama...and I have you..."`
`‘Then you aren't lonely, at all!`
` Uryu!’`
`".........Uu."`
`‘Mama is busy with her work, so she can't be with you very often, but please, don't blame her for that, Maria.`
` ......In exchange, I'll always be by your side, and I'll be there forever and ever. ...............So don't cry, okay...?’`
`‘.........Uryu...`
` Me being with you.........can't stop you feeling sad......?’`
`"............uuu, ......uuuuuuuuuuu, Sakutaro...`
` ......uuuuuuuuu!!`
` UwaaAAaaAaahhh, waaAAahaaaAAahaaahhh..."`
`.........From the holes in Maria's heart, which she had been doing her best to seal up, ...drops of sadness finally dripped down.`
` ......Drip, drip.`
` Plop, plop.`
`......Sniff, sniff, drip, drip, plop, plop.`
`Even though weekends where Mama doesn't come home aren't that rare a thing.`
`......Even though this night wasn't especially more painful or sad than any other.`
`......Maria's tears poured down.`
`‘Uryuu...!`
` Don't cry, Maria...`
` I'll always be with you...`
` Even if you're going to cry, I won't.`
` I'm a lion cub, I can't cry just because I'm lonely.`
` ......I want to cry too...but I'm {i:not going to}...!’`
`"Why won't you cry, Sakutaro...?`
` You still won't cry, even when it's this lonely and you can't hold back the tears...?"`
`‘Uryu.`
` But if I cry, who will make you feel better...?`
` So I'm not going to cry.`
` Because I want to make you smile.’`
`"If I smile, ......will Mama come back......?"`
`‘When she does come back and you greet her with a happy face, ......I'm sure she'll feel the same.`
` Uryu.’`
`"......Mama...will be happy......?"`
`‘Uryu.`
` And then, I'm sure, it'll relieve her tiredness from work as well.`
` And then, I'm sure, she'll get in a good mood earlier than normal, and play with you a lot.’`
`".............................."`
`‘When you come home and Mama's waiting for you there, and she's in the kitchen in a good mood, don't you feel really happy?`
` It's definitely the same for her.’`
`"......If I stay here, being happy......she'll be happy too?"`
`‘Uryu!’`
`Sakutaro nodded deeply with his big head.`
`{n}No more tears could fall from Maria's eyes.`
`......Because if she greeted her mama with a tear‐stained face, her mama would probably get sad too.`
`‘You know this already, Maria.`
` You can't use the magic that creates smiles if you aren't smiling too.’`
`"......Yeah.`
` ......I know.`
` So I won't cry anymore."`
`‘Hey, Maria.`
` I have an idea for how we can have a fun time.`
` ......Uryu, can I tell you?’`
`"......What is it?"`
`‘Mama won't be coming back until late night Sunday.`
` Why don't we have a pajama party in secret, without Mama ever knowing?’`
`"Pajama party...?"`
`‘Until you get tired late tonight, you can play with me while eating candy and drinking soda in bed.’`
`"A pajama party.`
` ......Yeah, that sounds fun.`
` ...I don't have to go to bed at nine?`
` Mama won't get mad at me for not going to bed?"`
`‘This is a secret between you and me, only for when Mama isn't around.`
` So, until you get sleepy, let's spend the whole night having fun together.’`
`‘Let's eat jellybeans and try to guess what color we'll get next.`
` Let's split open peanuts and try to guess {c:86EF9C:which half is the grandpa}.’`
`‘Let's search for treasure in the closet.`
` And more, so much more!`
` I wonder what it'll taste like if we mix orange juice and melon soda.’`
`"Uu.`
` Wanted to try that once, but asked Mama if it was alright and she got mad."`
`‘Uryuu!`
` Let's try it out in secret from Mama{p:0:♪}`
` Tonight, let's play a lot, laugh a lot, and blow away our tears with happiness.`
` Don't worry, with me here, it'll definitely be fun!`
` I'll make you happy for sure, Maria.’`
`"Yeah... Yeah.`
` I know it'll be fun with you here.`
` It'll definitely make me happy.`
` Thanks, Sakutaro.`
` Won't cry anymore.`
` Let's have a super fun time together, make ourselves super happy, and say welcome home with a smile on our faces when Mama gets back."`
`‘Uryuu!`
` Let's play and play tonight and get in a really great mood{p:0:♪}`
` Let's play a lot in a secret party that we can only have when Mama isn't here.’`
`‘If we're lively enough, I'm sure plenty of friends will come to play from Wonderland and Looking‐Glass Land.`
` We'll have so many friends at that point that there simply won't be time left to feel bored.`
` Uryuu!’`
`"Uryuu!!"`
`......And then I started my pajama party with Sakutaro, and had fun until late into the night.`
`I played by sticking my hand into the bag of jellybeans without looking, and trying to guess which color I would pull out.`
`......Sakutaro had good intuition and got it right a lot.`
`{n}Partway through, I also achieved the brilliant feat of guessing right four times in a row.`
`The game where I split peanuts open and tried to guess which half would be the grandpa...`
`was easier than guessing the color of the jellybeans, so I got it right a lot.`
`Sucking my salt‐covered fingers was bad manners, but that was the yummiest part.`
`I like both orange juice and melon soda on their own.`
`I hoped that by mixing those two favorite drinks, there might be a flash of light like alchemy,`
` and a new drink that no one had ever tasted before would be created.`
`I got excited about how, if it turned out really delicious, I'd call it Sakutaro Soda and sell it.`
`But, unexpectedly, it had a weird and disappointing taste.`
`{n}And the color was somewhat dull and boring.`
`...Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised that orange and green mixed together would make this.`
` ......Too bad. I imagined that it would become a sparkling pineapple color.`
`But, it was an awesome, awesome, fun night.`
`If I'm having this much fun, maybe Mama will start wanting to come home too, and unexpectedly appear at the front door.`
`......So I got the feeling that Mama might suddenly come home,`
` and went to the front door many times to check, but there was no way Mama would be able to come home when she was this busy with work.`
`But rather than a feeling of loneliness,`
` I felt just a little disappointed that I couldn't invite Mama to join in on such a fun late‐night party.`
`Next time, I'll do this when Mama is around, and let her join in.`
`Even some things that I don't think are yummy, Mama says are delicious,`
` so she might say that Sakutaro Soda is really yummy.`
`When Mama comes back tired, I'll serve her some.`
`And more than anything.`
`......I wanted to at least write about this fun night in a letter, and tell Mama about it.`
`Hoping that these strong feelings of happiness would reach Mama too.`
`Hoping that when Mama comes home exhausted from her job, which is always so tough for her, I could share this happiness with her.`
`Hoping that when Mama comes home late Sunday night, almost certainly tired,`
` I could make her even just a little brighter by sharing this happiness......`
`I softly placed that letter on Mama's desk.`
`{e:070:To Mama.`
`{n}Good job with your work again today{p:0:☆} Some of my happiness for you to share.`
`{n}{m:-5:―}―From Maria}`
`Then, I decided to give a present to Sakutaro for proposing this wonderful night.`
`A small red scarf that I had found when searching for treasure in my closet.`
`When Maria was still very young, her mama had knitted this tiny, tiny, red scarf for her.`
`"Maria" was embroidered on it with knitting wool.`
`......She softly wrapped that scarf around Sakutaro.`
`It really suited him, accenting his yellow with red very well.`
`‘.........Uryu.`
` ...Does it suit me......?’`
`Sakutaro looked embarrassed as he wore his first present ever.`
`......Yeah.`
` It really suits him.`
`"Uu.`
` Sakutaro, thank you so much for everything.`
` It was so fun tonight.`
` I can't even remember why I was crying.`
` ......Let's always stick together, okay?`
` And let's always play and laugh together."`
`‘Uryuu!`
` Love you, Maria!’`
`"Me too.`
` Love you, Sakutaro."`
`After playing so wildly, my room was a mess.`
`Maybe I played a little too much.`
`......But I'm tired for today, so let's sleep together now.`
` And tomorrow, we'll clean up together and welcome Mama with a clean room.`
` ......Okay? Sakutaro?`
`Uryuu{p:0:♪}`
`"......See?`
` See how happy I...no, see how happy me and Sakutaro are?"`
`"..................`
` Is this your happiness, Maria onee‐chan...?"`
`"Yep.`
` I am happy."`
`"......Even though you were looking forward to that movie so much, and Aunt Rosa promised that she'd definitely take you, she completely forgot."`
`"She just happened to forget because she was so busy with work.`
` ......Even if she had remembered, she couldn't have done anything about it with her work."`
`"Whether she remembered or not, Mama would spend the night at work in either case.`
` She couldn't go to the movies.`
` .........Whether she remembered the promise or not is insignificant."`
`......There's no way that's insignificant.`
`After all, ......when Aunt Rosa replied "The movies?" on the phone,`
` it was obvious that she had completely forgotten her promise.`
`And when she heard that, Maria onee‐chan's mood definitely darkened.`
`"Well, ......like you say,`
` even if Aunt Rosa had remembered her promise, you wouldn't have been able to go to the movies in the end."`
`"......But even so.`
` ......To think that your mother just forgot her promise to spend one of her few days off with you, ...it's sad.`
` I'd be angry."`
`"..............................`
` ...Yeah.`
` It was sad.`
` Because even if she had remembered, we wouldn't have been able to go to the movies."`
`"......But after that, I had a very, very fun night with Sakutaro.`
` You must've thought that pajama party looked really fun too, Ange."`
`"...........................`
` There's no way that would be fun."`
`"...I mean, all of that messing around you did that night,`
` ......was just you intentionally making a frenzy out of nothing so you could forget that you were lonely and that your mother wasn't coming home."`
`"That's not true.`
` Really did have a fun party with Sakutaro."`
`"No, you didn't!`
` You were just so sad, and you hated your mother so much for forgetting her promise, that you made a mess of your room...!!"`
`"...............Where was something like that ever written in my diary?"`
`"It isn't {i:written} anywhere!`
` But......by reading in the gaps between every line, I can tell how you felt!`
` You didn't have a good time at all that evening!"`
`"And you stayed up late when you were told not to, broke the strict rule about not eating sweets outside of snack time,`
` ......and when even that didn't bury your sadness, you went wild in your room, .........and made a mess of it, isn't that all...?!!"`
`"And after you made a mess of your room and were all tired out,`
` .........all you did was claw at the bed sheets and cry yourself to sleep...!"`
`".........It is written in the diary that Mama probably forgot her promise about the movie,`
` and that I stayed up late having a pajama party with Sakutaro, ......and made a mess of my room searching for treasure."`
`"Yes.`
` And that.........can only mean one thing, can't it?!`
` You were starving for Auntie Rosa's love...!`
` And Aunt Rosa always put her work and her public image first, always keeping you on the back‐burner...!"`
`"That's why it makes my skin crawl!`
` Because I know just how superficial Aunt Rosa's words of {i:love} for you are!!`
` You should realize this yourself!"`
`"So......how can you say that you're happy?!`
` I don't {i:understand} that......that part of you, Maria onee‐chan!!`
` Even at this age, I can't understand it at all...!!"`
`"How aren't you sad?`
` How is it that you can experience a reality filled with misfortune and call yourself happy?!`
` I can't do it, I can't understand it...!!"`
`"...............You are a sad kid, Ange."`
`"I don't get it!!`
` Why are {i:you} pitying {i:me}?!"`
`".........Even though a "fact" about a really fun pajama party is written in my diary,`
` .........when it's observed by a different person, it looks like that same "fact" takes a different form, huh."`
`I remembered talking about this with {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`Truth is indeterminate and changes its form every time it's observed.`
`{n}By the way it is perceived, ...in other words, depending on the person who perceives it, a single truth becomes different truths.`
`And truths of the past are painted over by truths of the future......`
`"In this diary, I wrote that what happened that night was very, very fun."`
`"......You described the events of that night as something very happy."`
`"And yet, when you read the diary, you read the events of that night as very, very sad."`
`"......Even though you described it as happiness, I read it as something different."`
`"Stop it."`
`"................................."`
`"This...tells of a happy night.`
` .........This is...the "truth" of that night.`
` Please, don't take this happy truth,`
` ............and paint over it with a new and different truth."`
`"............Does this make you......happy, Maria onee‐chan?"`
`"Yep.`
` Happy.`
` .........That's why I feel so sorry for you, because you can't feel happiness in the same situation."`
`.........Both she back then, and I now, have the same friendless and lonely situation.`
`And Ange......accepted the lonely truth as the lonely truth.`
` But {i:she}......painted over the lonely truth with a happy truth.`
`Ushiromiya Maria took the sad truth...`
`...and changed it into happiness.`
`That...`
`...is the only, and yet all too large, ...difference between me and Maria onee‐chan.`
`And at the same time as being unable to accept it,`
` ......another part of me is jealous of that power.`
`"Yeah.`
` ......That's right.`
` It is "power".`
` ......With that power, I was able to become happy.`
` And without it, you can't."`
`"That.........power,`
` ............what is it............?"`
`"I didn't know what to call that power either.`
` ......At this point in time, at least.`
` ...Eventually, I would be taught its true form."`
`"......I'll talk about it later.`
` On a later page.`
` .........So then, so then, late Sunday night.`
` With a present, just like she'd promised, Mama came back......"`
`".........I'm back."`
`"Mamaaaa, welcome hoooooooome!!"`
`‘Uryuu!!`
` Mama came back, Mama came back!’`
`Waiting to greet Rosa, as she returned home all tired out,`
` was Maria, holding Sakutaro, in an unbelievably good mood.`
`Rosa's worn out expression was surely due at least in part to actual fatigue,`
` ......but also partially because she was sick and tired of having Maria cling to her and loudly whine and sob after being left alone in the house for a few days.`
`However, when she was welcomed by an unbelievably happy Maria,`
` ......and discovered unbelievably that her fears had been unfounded, Rosa couldn't hide her surprise.`
`"Wh‐......what's going on, Maria...?`
` You're in a great mood, aren't you...?!`
` Is someone here...?!"`
`It was strange enough to make Rosa think that a friend might have come over, and that she had come back home in the middle of them having a good time playing together.`
`But there were no other shoes by the entrance.`
`......Even though Maria was in such high spirits, she was home alone.`
`At first, Rosa was suspicious that this unexpectedly good mood might have some kind of unwelcome underlying cause,`
` but that really was a needless fear, ......and it really did seem to be that Maria had actually stayed at home in a good mood.`
`.........Even if Rosa's heart had been as cold and hard as a rock, ...after being welcomed with a smile like this...`
`...Rosa started to honestly accept that smile, and a smile rose to her own face automatically.`
`......In that smile, you could see none of the weariness caused by being unable to return home for several days.`
`Maria kept talking about what a fun time she'd had playing with the stuffed animal Sakutaro.`
`Rosa really hadn't imagined that the stuffed animal she'd gifted her would be liked so much, and she couldn't hide her pleasant surprise.`
`"I see.`
` So you and Sakutarou were having fun watching the house together.`
` Well done, Maria.`
` I have presents for you and Sakutarou for being so good."`
`‘Uryuu!`
` Presents!`
` Presents!’`
`"Uu!`
` I wonder what they are, I wonder what they are!"`
`Maria started jumping around with Sakutaro.`
`There were two presents.`
` One was a Western cake assortment.`
`It contained different kinds of Scotch cakes.`
` It looked to be of very high quality.`
`But Maria was more interested in the other one.`
`{n}The other one was an even bigger box, and it was pretty heavy.`
`"Open it and have a look.`
` They might become new friends for you and Sakutarou, who knows?"`
`"Wowwwwwwwwww...!`
` What's this!`
` What's this?!"`
`Inside, laid there like chess pieces, were about twenty small ceramic animal figures.`
`Squirrels, rabbits, small birds, dogs and cats.`
`{n}And they were all holding musical instruments.`
`In addition to them, there was also a panorama‐style background.`
`{n}A forest scene was drawn on it.`
`{n}Little woodland animals were all gathered around a forest clearing, and they looked like they were having a good time.`
`Rosa set it up on the table.`
`......And when she then lined up the ceramic figures like chess pieces in front of it,`
` .........it became a band of forest animals.`
`"Isn't it wonderful?`
` I saw it in the store window, and I was taken with it at a glance.`
` This is a present for you for being such a good girl home alone, Maria."`
`"Uuuu!!!`
` Thank you, Mamaaa!!!"`
`"Isn't this amazing, Sakutaro?!`
` Look how many more friends we have...!`
` It was just like you said, Sakutaro!`
` It was true, we had a fun and lively time, and we {i:did} get more friends...!"`
`‘See, didn't I tell you?`
` Look, we have more friends, look, we have more friends!`
` Uryu~{p:0:♪}’`
`Relieved that her gift had been appreciated,`
` Rosa suddenly remembered that she was filled with several days of weariness...`
`"Mama, you really worked hard...!`
` You should go take a shower.`
` If you take a hot one, I'm sure your tiredness will go away.`
` Want to take a bath?`
` I'll choose what to put in the bath today!"`
`"Thank you.`
` But it's already late, so you get ready for bed.`
` Mama's tired, so I'll just take a shower and go to bed right away.`
` I have to get up early tomorrow."`
`"Yep, okay!`
` Here, Mama, I'll take your coat off for youuu."`
`"No, really, I can do it myself...`
` ...Ahh, thank you."`
`"Your coat is full of smells from outside.`
` ......Uu?`
` Oh, sorry, dropped something.`
` I'll pick it up, okay?"`
`When she had taken Rosa's coat, a receipt or ticket stub or something had fallen out.`
`...It had been in her mama's pocket, so it was probably important.`
`Maria hurriedly picked it up...`
`It looked like a ticket for a Green Car or the Shinkansen or something.`
`............Atami?`
` Maybe it's that place famous for its hot springs...?`
`Just then.`
` ...A razor‐sharp sound shattered the warm atmosphere.`
`Instead of the Rosa who had been there just a second ago, enjoying a gift with her daughter and full of weariness after returning home for the first time in several days,`
` .........there stood a completely different person, who looked exactly the same, but had the most terrible of expressions on her face.`
`...In her hand was the ticket stub that Maria had picked up.`
`{n}...She had stolen it from Maria's hand in an instant.`
`After a few seconds' delay,`
` ...by the pain of her hand that had been hit,`
` and her mother's expression,`
` Maria realized that she must have done something wrong.`
`But she didn't know what she had done that had gotten her in trouble.`
`......It was probably because of that ticket‐stub‐like thing.`
`Was she not supposed......to touch it.........?`
`Even though she had tried so hard to welcome her mama with fun and happiness,`
` ...she had touched something important to her without asking, and had ruined that pleasant atmosphere...`
`......So Maria apologized immediately.`
`"S‐......sorry........."`
`"............nh.`
` .................."`
`Even though she must have heard those words of apology, Rosa's expression actually darkened.`
`...Maybe those words had been undesired?`
`Maria didn't know what to do, and cautiously watched to see how her mother would act...`
`Then, even though it should have been such an important ticket stub,`
` Rosa crushed it up and hurried off to her room...`
`Maria......didn't really understand what she had done wrong......`
`".........Uu......`
` ......I must have...`
`......done something I shouldn't have......`
` ...That paper must have been something important for Mama's work.`
` And I touched it without asking..."`
`‘Uryu......`
` ...You didn't do anything wrong, Maria.........`
` ...So look how happy we are tonight as well.’`
`"Yeah.`
` ...Happy."`
`‘And when Mama takes a bath and clears her head, she'll go back to being the normal, nice Mama.`
` So you mustn't worry about it.`
` Uryu.’`
`"You're right......`
` Mama's tired too, after all.`
` ......Uu, mustn't worry about it.`
` We're so very happy tonight."`
`‘Uryu.’`
`"..................Please stop.`
` ...I can't bear to watch this."`
`"......Ange, I think you're looking for happiness in the wrong way."`
`"You're the one who's wrong!!`
` How can you call this happiness...?!!`
` It's too...painful for me even to watch it anymore!!"`
`"What is...?`
` That Mama suddenly got mad?`
` .........That happens sometimes when people get tired.`
` ......Condemning a person because of a momentary misplaced emotion isn't very adult of you, Ange."`
`"......I can't believe I'm hearing this from a nine‐year‐old...`
` But that's not the problem, is it?!`
` That ticket stub you picked up was clearly strange!"`
`"How?`
` There was nothing strange about it, and it has nothing to do with the happiness of that night..."`
`"Aunt Rosa called you saying she'd be staying over at work because of her job, right?!`
` Why Atami?!`
` Isn't that what you call a vacation?!"`
`"It means she left you behind and went on a vacation, doesn't it?!`
` And you normally don't go on a vacation by yourse—"`
`"Even if that was a ticket for Atami,`
` that alone doesn't make it proof that Mama lied and went on a vacation, does it...?"`
`"She lied on the phone, changed her expression like that and grabbed it from you!`
` What more proof could you want...?!!"`
`".........It might be from a business trip long ago, right?`
` Or maybe she just happened to pick up some trash or something and put it in her pocket.`
` It might even be a receipt from someone who works for her who went on a business trip."`
`"...In that case, it was important for her work.`
` It wasn't a toy, so I can understand why Mama took it away.`
` ......This evidence you're talking about is nothing more than circumstantial evidence.`
` Imagination and delusions.`
` ......I don't know why you're interpreting it so that my relationship with Mama is bad."`
`"I'm the one who doesn't understand how you can interpret it in a way that's so convenient for Aunt Rosa!!"`
`".........You really are a poor child, Ange.`
` .........There are fragments that could make you happy,`
` so many of them, scattered all about your feet, and you can't find them."`
`"......Instead, all you find are the unhappy fragments, and you keep getting hurt over and over.`
` ......That's why you get scared of being hurt,`
` ......and you can't start even looking for happiness until after you've finished making sure that there's nothing around you that could hurt you."`
`"..................When I talk with you, Onee‐chan, it gets hard to tell which one of us isn't making sense."`
`"You know what?`
` There are lots and lots of both happy and unhappy fragments, and the world is full to the brim with both kinds.`
` So people who can't find happiness right beside them won't be able to find it no matter where they go looking.`
` ......Like Tyltyl and Mytyl searching for the blue bird."`
`"............Yes.`
` The story did have that moral."`
`"You're the complete opposite, Ange.`
` You're searching for a world without a single unhappy fragment.`
` But even that's the same as the blue bird.`
` So you'll be unable to find your own happiness for all eternity."`
`"............Battler is Hansel, is he?`
` Isn't he the blue bird......?"`
`"......Give it a rest already.`
` .........In any event, I got the point that a night of happiness was wasted because of a single scrap of paper that fell from a coat."`
`"It's scary, isn't it?`
` That a single scrap of paper could do that.`
` ......In that case, maybe the power to get happiness back can also lie in a single scrap of paper, don't you think?"`
`Just when she had finally been able to bond with Maria after so long......`
`Rosa's face twisted with a mixture of anger, sadness, and a fierce self‐hatred as she flew into her room and closed the door.`
`.........Maria's "sorry" had stuck into her chest more sharply than any knife.`
`Then,`
` ......she noticed a cute envelope placed on her study table.`
`It was probably something that had come with a girls' magazine.`
`.........To Mama.`
` Some of my happiness for you to share, it said.`
`She took it, .........hesitated, opened it, ...and read what was inside.`
`....................................`
`Then, after dotting the surface of the paper...`
`with two large tears...`
`......she flew out of the room,`
` hugged Maria from behind as she headed for the bathroom,`
` .........buried her face into her daughter's back,`
` ......and cried.`
`And, realizing that she was the one who should truly be saying sorry,`
` ...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`she apologized to her.`
`And when Maria asked why,`
` she gave no answer......`
`".........See.`
` Already made up.`
` .........A little thing like that was absolutely nothing to worry about, because of the friendliness between Mama and me."`
`"........................`
` .........Your happiness is...too painful for me."`
`"......I do understand your feelings more or less, Ange.`
` ......Until I realized my "power",`
` ...even I was just like you, a sorry child who could only find fragments filled with misfortune."`
`"............What is this "power"?`
` This power that I don't have, but you do.`
` ...And are you saying that me not having it is the reason I have misery and you have joy?`
` .........Just what is this {i:thing} that you can't describe except with an abstract word like "power"......?"`
`"Yeah.`
` That is what you want to know, isn't it, Ange?`
` ......That's why you've been reading my story all this time."`
`"............Of course I'll teach you.`
` The secret to that power.`
` ......And I did teach you about it long ago, when you were little, you know...?`
` Did you forget...?"`
`"Don't worry, you'll be able to remember.`
` ......Now I...`
`......no, she.`
` She will teach you."`
`"............She......?`
` Who's that?"`
`{a:c:`
`"I shall teach you in {f:5:Maria}'s place."}`
`".........B‐`
`............{f:5:Beatrice}..............."`
`"The "power" that {f:5:Maria} has, but you do not."`
`"Yep.`
` The "power" I have, but you do not."`
`{m:-5:―}―{i:That}...is magic.`
`Maria and Beato said it together.`
` And then they started giggling because they'd said it at the same time.`
`......It was an innocent behavior, which seemed somehow unlike Beato.`
`Black tea was arranged on a table in a peaceful garden,`
` and Beato, Maria, and Sakutarou, who was sitting on Maria's lap, were having fun chatting...`
`"............Hoh.`
` I see, so he is called Sakutarou.`
` And your best friend, you say!"`
`‘Uryu...`
` It's nice to meet you, my name is Sakutarou...’`
`"Uu, Sakutaro is shy so he's nervous right now.`
` It's okay, {f:5:Beatrice} is my wonderful friend too...!"`
`‘Uryu.`
` Are your friends my friends...?’`
`"Yeah!"`
`‘Uryu. ......Then I'm {f:5:Beatrice}'s friend too?’`
`"Yeah!"`
`‘Uryuu!’`
`"......Maria, do things like this happen frequently for you in your everyday life?"`
`"Uu?`
` Things?"`
`"Is breathing a soul of magic into inorganic matter and giving it life in this way...`
`a commonplace practice for you?"`
`"......Uu.`
` Sakutaro isn't inorganic matter, he's a lion cub."`
`‘Uryuu!’`
`"Hmm......`
` ......A stuffed animal makes for an excellent vessel.`
` Therefore, when it is spoken to by an innocent child without toxin, it is not uncommon for a spirit to take up residence within, in an attempt to respond to them."`
`According to {f:5:Beatrice}, when a child "plays with dolls",`
` the dolls sometimes gain an actual will and converse with them, in rare cases even moving on their own.`
`However, the power that they can imbue into such a vessel is very weak due to their innocence.`
`If even a tiny bit of the toxin from a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}'s common sense gets involved, and tells them that there's no way a doll can talk or move,`
` it instantly reverts to being an ordinary non‐speaking doll......`
`"However, ......this...Sakutarou stuffed animal of yours is different."`
`"Uu!`
` Sakutaro is a stuffed animal, but he's not just a stuffed animal!"`
`‘Uryuu!`
` Lion cuuuub!`
` Ga‐...ga‐......uryuu!’`
`"Sakutaro is a lion cub, but he's still a kid, so he can't say {ruby:roar:gaooo} sometimes.`
` Uryu‐uryu‐uryu{p:0:♪}"`
`‘Uryu‐uryu‐uryuu!’`
`{f:5:Beatrice} let out a sigh of admiration as she gazed at Maria, playing around with Sakutaro at the table loaded with tea.`
`".........How incredible.`
` This "Sakutarou", with a core of a cloth‐and‐cotton vessel, has completely manifested into the human world.`
` He has his own character, talks with his summoner freely,`
` {i:and even moves by his own will}."`
`"......And what is most surprising is that you did not summon him by name as a being from another world,`
` but created him out of the sea of zero."`
`After that, Maria boasted to Beato that Sakutarou wasn't her only friend, and that when she went home, there would be plenty more of them.`
`She claimed that there were other similar stuffed animals and dolls who, like Sakutarou, could talk and move of their own will.`
`It was something natural to Maria.`
` It was {i:natural} for stuffed animals to talk, move, and become her friends of their own free will.`
`......When she heard Maria speak of this in that way, {f:5:Beatrice}, as a witch, felt a respect bordering on awe.`
`"............Maria.`
` Without a doubt, that power of yours is magic."`
`"It's magic......?`
` But I'm still a witch apprentice, I'm not able to use magic yet..."`
`"Not so, it is magic indeed.`
` .........You may be an apprentice since you are unable to use it in full awareness of that fact,`
` ......but even so, what power this magic has!`
` The manifestation of your friend Sakutarou is excellent proof of that."`
`"Many...festation...?"`
`"Mm.`
` In your case, it may even be fitting to call it creation.`
` ......A piece of inorganic matter that would have no soul at all in another's hands has had a soul imbued into it through your magic."`
`"Furthermore, you are using strong power to keep it tethered to the human world.`
` ......In this era so filled with the toxin that denies magic, maintaining the magical power necessary to manifest a being to the degree that it can exist as an independent life‐form is not easy even for me."`
`It isn't hard to create soulless beings in any number.`
`{n}However, creating a being with a soul is very difficult.`
`{n}...Beato declared this definitively.`
`".........Don't really understand what you're saying, Beato.`
` You're saying Sakutaro is amazing...?"`
`"I am saying that you and Sakutarou both are marvelous.`
` ......You may feel proud.`
` ...Yes, that which Kinzo desired above all else seems to dwell most strongly within you."`
`"Don't have a clue why you're praising me so much.`
` Ri~ght, Sakutaro?"`
`‘Uryu~!’`
`"......What is truly admirable is not only that you have caused a soul to reside in a stuffed animal.`
` It is the fact that by that act, you have changed your own worldview.`
` ......Your power to create something from nothing is beyond exceptional."`
`"......It is simple to make a hundred from one.`
` However, creating one from zero is not easy.`
` ...When you become a full witch, you may not only be a match for me, but might even grow into a Great Witch that I must acknowledge as superior."`
`"The Witch of Origins, perhaps.`
` .........I, too, am greatly looking forward to your future."`
`"Uu!`
` Beato said I have talent as a wi~tch!"`
`‘Isn't that great, Maria?!`
` Uryu, Beato...thank you for praising Maria.’`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` There is no need to thank me, Sakutarou.`
` That red scarf truly suits you.`
` And I am envious of the talent of your master that enabled her to create a friend like you."`
`‘Uryu~!`
` Thanks for complimenting my scarf.`
` I got it as a present from Maria.`
` I really like it.’`
`"And its size is truly as if it was created just for you.`
` ......Yes, in light of this, I see that I must also give my new friend some kind of present."`
`"Uu?`
` Beato, you're giving Sakutaro a present......?"`
`"A gift from a witch must be something with magical power, of course.`
` In that case, so that your friend can remain your friend for all time, and so that you can have even more fun playing with him..."`
`"I shall give Sakutarou my magic power.`
` It should allow him to achieve an even stronger manifestation."`
`"Uu?`
` I'll be able to have much more fun playing with Sakutaro...?`
` How?"`
`‘Uryu......?`
` What could it be, Maria...`
` Is it something scary......?’`
`"Don't worry.`
` Beato won't do anything scary.`
` Right, {f:5:Beatriceee}?!"`
`"Mm.`
` I am certain that he will like it.`
` .........Let us see then...yes, in order to achieve a stronger manifestation, a stronger image will be necessary.`
` .........Well, now, what to do.`
` Hmmmmmmmmmm..."`
`Beato folded her arms and thought about what she could do to please them the most.`
`And at that moment, there appeared...`
`......the form of yet another witch.`
`{n}It was Beato's master, {f:5:Virgilia}.`
`{f:5:Virgilia} truly was a Great Witch.`
`...Since Maria already thought of Beato as a Great Witch, this person Beato called a Great Witch must have been a Great Great Witch.`
`According to Beato, not even she could hold a candle to this witch when it came to magical power.`
`"My, my.`
` I {i:thought} I heard some cheery voices.`
` What a fun tea party this seems to be..."`
`"Oh, Master.`
` Perfect timing.`
` I want you to take a look at this lion cub.`
` I hear he's Maria's new friend."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` What an adorable little lion.`
` ......I wonder if he can greet me?`
` Hello, nice to meet you...?"`
`‘U‐uryuu!`
` I, I'm Sakutarou.’`
`Sakutaro got back down onto Maria's lap, and greeted {f:5:Virgilia} with half of his face poking out over the edge of the table.`
`...He seemed to be very nervous since this was a witch that even Beato called Master.`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` What a lovely name.`
` ......As a reward for giving such a good greeting, here's a sweet for you."`
`After waving her hands about, {f:5:Virgilia} held the palm of her hand upwards, and made a movement as though lightly grasping some of the air.`
`Then, she held that closed fist out in front of Sakutaro.`
`............And when she opened it, there lay one of those individually wrapped cough drops.`
`‘Uryuu?!`
` It's candy, Maria, oh wow, oh wow...!!’`
`"Uu!`
` Isn't that nice, Sakutaro?!`
` Make sure to thank her."`
`‘Uryu.`
` Thank you very much for the candy.`
` ...*bow*.’`
`Even though {f:5:Virgilia} was a Great Great Witch, she still treated a stuffed animal like Sakutarou to an elegant greeting.`
`"Still, Master, cough drops? Are you someone's granny or something...?!`
` Can't you at least pull out some strawberry‐milk candy~?"`
`"How mean.`
` Perhaps I won't give you candy anymore?"`
`"Kuhhyahhyahhya, sorry, sorry.`
` .........Well then, Maria.`
` Take out your grimoire.`
` And, of course, your writing tools."`
`"Uu?`
` Okay, taking it out.`
` Are we writing something?"`
`"......Oh? What's happening now?"`
`"I will use a magic I learned from you, Master.`
` .........Magic to make a resident of another world manifest into a vessel."`
`"I think that by applying that, I may be able to further strengthen the power manifesting this friend of Maria's.`
` ......I want to give that as a gift to Maria and her friend."`
`"I see.`
` ...It shouldn't be that difficult for a being that has already manifested.`
` That seems like it will turn out to be a wonderful gift.`
` Well then, I shall offer what modest help I can."`
`"If you shall be signing for this magic personally as a witness, Master, that is greatly encouraging...!`
` Rejoice, Maria.`
` This shall be a wonderful gift...!"`
`‘Uryu...?`
` What's happening...?`
` It isn't scary, is it?`
` Is it...?’`
`"Don't know.`
` But don't think it's scary.`
` ......Wonder what it is. Exciting, huh?"`
`Beato borrowed the grimoire from Maria's handbag and majestically riffled through the pages.`
`......Then, finding an empty page among those with magic circles drawn on them, she flattened the book out.`
`And after staring at Sakutarou with a smirk, she suddenly started darting her pen across the page.`
`......It was something like a written proclamation made by witches to a higher‐order world.`
`Magic, which would take effect by {f:5:Beatrice} writing it and {f:5:Virgilia} giving her signature as a witness.`
`Maria didn't understand what Beato was doing at first, but partway through, she figured out the wonderful magic power of this document, and her eyes began to sparkle...`
`‘Uryu?!`
` Uryu?!`
` What is it, Maria, what's she drawing?!`
` Uryu‐uryu?!’`
`Sakutarou was on her lap, so he didn't know what was being written up on the table.`
`......But even if he had seen, Sakutarou probably wouldn't have understood.`
`"It's amazing, Sakutaro!!`
` Wait a bit, almost done, almost done!`
` Beato that's awesome, Beato that's awesome!!"`
`".........When it comes to writing documents of power, this child's talent is splendid.`
` I expect you could even work as a secretary in the netherworld."`
`"How is this...?!`
` It should be passable...!"`
`After she had completed the thing she had been so intensely concentrating on, Beato looked over the document again from a distance.`
`......It seemed she was fairly satisfied with her work.`
`And Maria, upon also peeking in at it, let out a cry of wonder.`
`"......It's amazing, Beato!!`
` So cuuute!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"By the name of the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}, I hereby acknowledge Sakutarou, {f:5:Maria}'s child.`
` .........Master, if you would sign as a witness!"`
`"Yes, yes.`
` ......By my name, I stand witness to and acknowledge this oath.`
` .........It is done."`
`{f:5:Virgilia} signed, completing the proclamation.`
`It was a powerful document that proclaimed to the beings of a higher world that Sakutarou had most certainly manifested in the human world.`
`Sakutarou, created by Maria, had received the recommendation of the two witches {f:5:Beatrice} and {f:5:Virgilia},`
` and in this very moment, the higher world had accepted his existence.`
`......That was the great magic of manifestation.`
`According to Beato, it was apparently an incredible stroke of luck that {f:5:Virgilia} had been here.`
`Because the power residing in the proclamation would change drastically depending on the number and the ranks of the witches signing it.`
`{f:5:Virgilia} in particular had many friends in the higher world,`
` so her signature gave the proclamation a power with which Beato's couldn't even compare.`
`"By this proclamation, I accept thee, Sakutarou, as an individual with thine own sense of self.`
` And I welcome thee as a friend in accordance with the treaty of Mariage Sorcière.`
` Henceforth, Sakutarou, thou art our common friend."`
`"And as a gift, I shall bestow upon you a form appropriate to that status.`
` Accept it."`
`With the grimoire still opened to the page with the proclamation, she turned it around and handed it to Maria.`
`Maria showed it to Sakutarou on her lap.`
`When Sakutarou beheld that proclamation,`
` ............in his body made of cloth and cotton,`
` he felt something hot and bright begin to dwell.`
`Even as he looked around, nervous at this sensation that he had never felt before, that power strengthened,`
` ......and eventually, a bright light completely swallowed him up...`
`‘Uryu......?`
` Uryu‐uryu‐uryu‐uryu......!’`
`And when that light disappeared...`
`............There, Maria's friend Sakutarou held a new form, and {i:existed}.`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!`
` You're cute, Sakutaro!`
` Reeeeally cute!"`
`‘Uryu...?`
` Uryuu...`
` Does it really suit me?`
` It isn't embarrassing......?’`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` It is a very lovely form, Sakutarou‐chan."`
`"I felt that the scarf was his charm point, you see.`
` And the ears!`
` Animal ears are nice indeed, truly cute!`
` Allow me to nibble at them later.`
` *cackle*!"`
`"Thank you, {f:5:Beatriceee}!!`
` Thank you so much for the wonderful present!!"`
`"There is no need for thanks.`
` This is merely an expression of my respect for your wonderful magic and your friend."`
`".........And now that you have reached this level, it would not be odd for you to graduate from an apprentice at any time.`
` Starting today, I shall initiate you in even newer and more fun forms of magic."`
`"......From this point forward, you may call yourself {f:5:Maria}, the Apprentice Witch of Origins."`
`"What's the Witch of Origins...?"`
`"Mm.`
` It is the title of a witch who seeks to become a Creator.`
` Right now, you are just an Enchanter, possessing only enough strength to breathe magical power into the small objects around you."`
`"......But after one thousand years of training, it is not unthinkable that you could create not just your own {i:system} of magic, but even a galaxy."`
`"......The talent of the Witch of Origins is very rare.`
` Even though everyone has it when they are young, no one can continue to hold onto it.`
` ......This title is also proof that you have not lost your untainted heart."`
`"Uu!!`
` Witch of Origins, wow!`
` I'll become one!`
` I'm the Apprentice Witch of Origiiins!"`
`‘Maria, that's so cool...!`
` The Witch of Origins, wow, awesome, uryuu!’`
`"Eventually, you will probably be able to call yourself by the title of a full witch—Lady {f:5:Maria}, the Witch of Origins.`
` ......It may be a good time now to give not only Sakutarou, but you as well, an appearance fitting for your rank."`
`".........There.`
` I shall give a proper outfit for one who, while an apprentice, is worthy of calling herself a witch."`
`When Beato waved the pipe that was her wand,`
` many gold butterflies appeared out of nowhere, grouped around Maria, and granted her a wonderful dress.`
`Endowed with both cuteness and majesty, it was indeed a fitting article of clothing for the girl who would eventually take the name of the Witch of Origins...`
`"Oh wow...!!`
` Awesome awesome awesome awesome!!`
` So cute, so cute!`
` I want to show these clothes to Mama too...!!`
` Can't I?"`
`"The full dress of a witch must not be shown indiscriminately.`
` Such a thing is worth more if you reserve it for those most grandiose occasions.`
` *cackle*!"`
`And then, the Great Witch, the witch, the witch's apprentice, and their new friend Sakutarou, had a lively time enjoying their tea together......`
`".........See?`
` Look how happy I am.`
` And look how fun this is."`
`"..........................."`
`"Please, don't be afraid of being happy.`
` Becoming happy isn't the same thing as accepting your current misfortune.`
` It means creating a new happiness within your current misfortune.`
` That is the Magic of Origins."`
`"......I...didn't want to acknowledge my current world.`
` ......I couldn't abide accepting such an isolated and painful world.`
` ...That's why, even though I was entranced by your world, Maria onee‐chan,`
` ......I couldn't cross the final line."`
`"............I'll teach you.`
` About my Magic of Origins.`
` No, I taught you before, right?`
` And you used to be able to use it.`
` Did you forget......?"`
`"..........................."`
`"You were also a witch apprentice, Ange, with your name entered into Mariage Sorcière, weren't you?"`
`"............Yes.`
` So I was.`
` .........Mariage Sorcière,`
` ...that takes me back.`
` ......I also had my name entered in there at one point, didn't I..."`
`"Yes, I will never forget it.`
` It happened in April of 1987.`
` I received a certain strange request from a friend."`
`"......A large collection of books, the former possessions of a very rich man, were being sold at auction,`
` and it was thought that some of them might have been extremely valuable from an archaeological and folkloristic perspective, as well as in an occult sense,`
` so this friend wanted me to take a private look at their value."`
`"..................'87.`
` Half a year after the crime on Rokkenjima."`
`"Correct.`
` Those books were explained to have escaped the disaster on Rokkenjima.`
` I was told that the owner of the island, {nobr:Mrs. Ushiromiya} Eva, had put them up for auction."`
`They appeared to be at a high‐class restaurant.`
` Ange and a middle‐aged man were sitting across from one another in a pair of secluded and quiet seats.`
`Amakusa could be seen by the restaurant's entrance.`
`{n}He was probably keeping a lookout for pursuers from the Sumadera family.`
`The scholarly seeming man across from Ange spoke politely, but with enthusiasm.`
`He hadn't so much as touched the food in front of him, which communicated effectively the passion with which he was speaking.`
`He was a professor at a certain university, known in particular as an authority on Western folklore.`
`However, among his life works, that was only the one with the most acceptable public face.`
`His true life work...`
`was the study of Western occultism, Western magic, alchemy, and all else falling under the umbrella of "the occult",`
` as well as demonology.`
`In short, he was one of the people best positioned to understand the details of Kinzo's research...`
`"First, what I learned by appraising the books was that {nobr:Mrs. Ushiromiya} Eva had absolutely no education in folkloristics,`
` and that the original owner of the books, {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya} Kinzo, was without doubt one of the top five authorities on demonology in Japan."`
`April, 1987.`
`A major city antique shop came into possession of a large quantity of ancient texts thought to have a high historical value.`
`The texts had been entrusted to them by Ushiromiya Eva, who had requested for them to be put up for auction on her behalf.`
`At the time, everyone thought that Eva had succeeded the Ushiromiya family and obtained all the wealth for herself as the only survivor.`
`However, at that point, barely half a year had passed since the accident, which was not enough for the rest of the family to be legally declared dead in absentia, even given the extraordinary circumstances.`
`Because of that, Eva was thought to have been in a very tight spot financially, unable even to collect from her family's life insurance.`
`It seems that she tried to sell everything of value,`
` and even the books kept in Kuwadorian, her location when she escaped harm, became a target of this.`
`And when the authorities in the field gathered at the request of the antique shop to appraise these documents—which were later called "the Ushiromiya Library"—they were given the shock of their lives.`
`"At least speaking from the perspective of occultism,`
` the shock waves that discovery sent throughout the world were comparable to the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls."`
`"The reason for this is that the "Ushiromiya Library" even included some extremely important documents...`
`which had been known to exist for more than a thousand years, but had never before been found."`
`The so‐called "romantic" side of the occult, epitomized for example by alchemy, never ceases to stir an intense fascination in dilettantes.`
`Even now, it is whispered that in various places around the world, a great number of "magic books" of historical value...`
`might be in the secret possession of very wealthy lovers of the occult, unannounced to the public.`
`The prime candidates for this are said to be items such as Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks, which are particularly popular among dilettantes.`
`It is said that approximately five thousand pages of the notebooks currently exist, and over ten thousand have been lost,`
` but some researchers believe that a large part of this lost portion may be being monopolized by certain dilettantes and millionaires.`
`It is said that because of this, even now,`
` dilettantes who can't help but seek these spare no expense to search around for quietly hoarded‐away and unannounced notebooks...`
`There is probably no doubting that Ushiromiya Kinzo was himself one of those dilettantes.`
`It is unknown what Kinzo went through to obtain these,`
` but undoubtedly he must have spent his vast wealth like water, to buy them off other rich people with the same hobby as him.`
`The discovery of that huge number of books at the end of the 20th century, books so valuable that dilettantes were filled with the desire to hoard them away,`
` and their subsequent release to the public, gave the entire world a massive shock...`
`"Due to this incident, the name Rokkenjima became known across the world.`
` And at the same time, the world also received a shock at the very high probability that, due to the accident on Rokkenjima, a large amount of undiscovered books of even greater value had been lost."`
`"...After that discovery, the names of Rokkenjima and the Ushiromiya Library were certain to remain in our memories for all time."`
`......Our memories.`
` That "our" probably meant the occult neck of the woods with the same hobby as Kinzo.`
`This incident caused the name of Rokkenjima to develop an important meaning within the world of the occult.`
`Certainly, there had been a lot of reporting about the accident on Rokkenjima, but it hadn't been on an international level.`
`However, this incident circled the globe,`
` taking the image of Rokkenjima as a small island in the Izu archipelago, and painting it over as a demonic island with a mixture of riddles, suspicion, mystery and the occult.`
`In other words, until Kinzo's library was leaked to the public by Eva,`
` Rokkenjima had been nothing more than a nameless island that no one thought twice about,`
` ......and it definitely hadn't been a witch's island.`
`However, when knowledge of the Ushiromiya Library spread across the world, Rokkenjima's image immediately took on an occult twist.`
`"And so, what happened next was that matter with the message bottle.`
` It is what turned that island into a witch's island.`
` A nameless island in the Izu archipelago began to transition into an occult island, and then into the island of the mysterious witch, {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"You could say that, lacking either the Ushiromiya Library or the message bottle, the Rokkenjima Witch Legend would never have been established."`
`"......A message bottle."`
`"Yes.`
` A form of communication to an unspecified target by throwing an empty bottle with a letter sealed inside into the sea."`
`"It is famous as a way of sending an SOS from a deserted island, but because of the influence of famous foreign detective novels,`
` it has also become known as a method of confessing the truth after one's own death, like a time‐delayed will.`
` The Rokkenjima message bottle was certainly the latter."`
`"......This is the thing everyone says a fisherman on a nearby island picked up?"`
`"Correct.`
` We learned that a young fisherman on Shikinejima had picked up a wine bottle with a letter in it.`
` This young fisherman happened to keep it out of curiosity.`
` It was only later, when Rokkenjima fell under the global spotlight due to the Ushiromiya Library, that he announced his discovery."`
`"Is there any chance that it was a fabrication made by the fisherman?"`
`"Of course, we weren't able to deny that possibility.`
` The notebook pages in the wine bottle had the signature of a certain member of the Ushiromiya family.`
` A girl named Ushiromiya Maria.`
` However, from the handwriting found on her former belongings, it was ascertained that the handwriting in the letter belonged to a different person."`
`".........A different person's handwriting......?"`
`"Correct.`
` At the very least, I believe there can be no doubt that it was written by a person more skilled at writing and of a greater age than her.`
` There was a very high likelihood that it had been written by someone else using her name.`
` Therefore, at that point in time, the contents of those notebook pages were thought to have very low credibility."`
`However.`
`Later on, a sensation was created when it came to light that on the day of the accident, a similar message bottle had been recovered from the surrounding ocean by the police in their search for evidence.`
`"It seems that, due to evidence from the surrounding area and the intact state of the bottle's seal, the police had decided that its likelihood of being a hoax was low,`
` and that it had been cast out no earlier than a few days before the accident.`
` And the handwriting for both matched.`
` This caused the credibility of the notebook pages discovered by the fisherman to rise."`
`"As for the message bottles' contents, magazines and the like seem to have been reporting on that repeatedly, but do you require an explanation all the same?"`
`"......No.`
` I know about it, more or less."`
`Several sheets of notebook paper had been stuffed into each of the two wine bottles.`
`They were extensive accounts, written in a diary‐like fashion by some unknown person calling themselves Ushiromiya Maria, of the events of the day of the accident and the day before.`
`And it was these that prompted the beginning of the "Witch Legend Serial Murder Case",`
` and "the mystery of the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}".`
`"These bizarre diary‐style accounts describe the Ushiromiya family members, pinned to the island by the typhoon,`
` becoming caught up in a ritual for the resurrection of a witch, and being killed one after another in inexplicable ways."`
`"And at the end, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} revives, and swallows everything up into the Golden Land.`
` ......They were written almost as though {i:this} was the complete picture of the events of that day."`
`"Additionally, the state of things on the island at the time is also depicted in immense detail,`
` and former servants who once worked for the Ushiromiya family have given testimony that the pages were definitely written by a person who knew the inside details of the island."`
`"......So, those strange fantasy novels, the occult boom that started with the Ushiromiya Library,`
` and the fact that the truth remains shrouded in darkness—the combination of all three of these factors is what created the legend of the Rokkenjima witch...?"`
`"Correct.`
` Already more than ten years have passed since the incident, and it still attracts the interest of occult enthusiasts across the world."`
`"No, in fact, you could say that it has become {i:increasingly} deified as time has passed.`
` There are still many enthusiasts who try to land secretly on the shores of Rokkenjima even though that has been prohibited."`
`"......Could there be another message bottle that has still not been discovered?`
` And what really happened on that island that day?`
` There is still much to discuss, oh yes."`
`As though he had finally remembered that he had been going on and on for some time, the man took a sip of water.`
`......His potage was now cold, but it seemed that the man's hunger had already been blown away.`
`"......If I remember correctly, I heard that the fisherman's pages and the police's pages had completely different contents."`
`"Correct.`
` Due to that, the appeal of the Rokkenjima mystery increased even further.`
` Inside each of the two bottles was a diary‐style account describing the events of the day of the accident and the day before.`
` However, while they both cover the same two‐day period, the contents are completely different."`
`"As though one is true and one is untrue.`
` Or perhaps both are untrue.`
` ...However, the beginning and the end alone {i:do} match in both."`
`"At the beginning, the 18 people including the relatives are sealed up on the island by the typhoon.`
` And at the end, everyone dies, the Golden Witch revives, and everything is swallowed up into the Golden Land."`
`The contents of both message bottles described the events of the two days of the accident.`
`But the details were completely different.`
`Both diaries outline a serial murder following the epitaph of the witch, but the order of the sacrifices, the manners of their deaths, and even the "tale" of the two days are different.`
`However, both depict the same ultimate conclusion: everyone dies and the witch revives.`
`"Since the only survivor, {nobr:Mrs. Ushiromiya} Eva, remained silent about what happened on that island,`
` the events of that entire two‐day period are shrouded in darkness."`
`"These two diaries presented not just one, but {i:two} theories to wipe away that darkness.`
` You could explain those two days with either diary.`
` However, we don't know which is correct, or even if there is anything correct contained within them."`
`{m:-5:―}―Schrödinger's...cat box.`
`If it isn't denied, even fiction can be truth.`
`Through the media, these notebook pages had of course been shown to Eva as well, but in the end, she never broke her silence......`
`"Who sent the message bottles...and why?"`
`"Do you remember the magazine that put together a special issue for the crime's tenth anniversary? They covered that question in extensive detail.`
` It seems that their theory is the one that garners the most support today."`
`"But it is rather dull.`
` ......What happened on that island, on that day?`
` Considering this question is the real thrill of the Witch Hunt."`
`"Witch Hunt...?"`
`"Yes, the Rokkenjima Witch Hunt—it's the name of a group of enthusiasts endeavoring to explain the truth of that crime from an occult perspective."`
`"From the Ushiromiya Library to the mysterious two‐day period, the legend of the Golden Witch and more, discussion of the mysteries that surround Rokkenjima is flourishing even today among enthusiasts."`
`"For the ten‐year anniversary, an international convention was held in New York.`
` I was there participating as well, representing Japan!`
` I was able to have a variety of interactions with zealous overseas Witch Hunters."`
`"Witches are a very popular category overseas.`
` The age span of the participants was truly vast, stretching from elementary schoolers at the bottom, all the way to famous cultural figures at the top!`
` Even in Japan, in recent years, we've finally—"`
`......You probably don't need any more explanation, but he is one of the most famous Rokkenjima Witch Hunters in Japan.`
`After that, he just kept continuing on excitedly all by himself, even though I'd never asked.`
`As I swirled the thin film on my potage with my spoon, I shrugged my shoulders and sighed.`
`......Maybe it really had been a waste of time to research about the message bottle.`
`No, if there was one thing I'd gotten out of this, it was the knowledge that those pages, supposedly written by Maria onee‐chan,`
` had actually been written by a different person faking her name.`
`And that person had taken it upon themselves to write an occult story, put it into a bottle as though it was the truth, and throw it into the sea.`
`...This raised questions for me.`
`Why did they go to all the trouble of writing so much in order to prepare a suspicious letter like that?`
`With a message bottle, there would be no guarantee that it would ever pass into anyone's hands.`
`If their luck had been bad, it could have sunk in the ocean and never been seen by anyone.`
`And even if someone were to pick it up, they might have thrown it away without even thinking twice about it.`
`......Why did they entrust their confession of the truth to the sea in such an uncertain method?`
`And why did they write up multiple different tales?`
`If there had been one message bottle, claiming that its story was the truth would be reckless, but not impossible.`
`However, because there were two, that made both of them doubtful.`
`If someone was plotting to make out those two mysterious days to be the work of a witch, that was really superfluous.`
`And because there were two, it suggested that an undiscovered third one, or possibly even more, might exist.`
`......In other words, the two having differing contents was making it even harder to take either of them at face value.`
`But despite their differences, the contents of the two matched in that both tales told of a witch.`
`Does that mean that this is what the writer wanted to tell us.........?`
`......I can only imagine that this was a crime committed for pleasure, by someone who wanted to create an illusion of a witch.`
`But 17 people excluding Aunt Eva lost their lives, and a vast inheritance—and maybe even ten tons of gold—changed hands behind the scenes.`
`It just doesn't make sense for the confession coming at the end of all that to be this fantasy about a witch.`
`I don't need to hear the magazines' reasoning to find it extremely doubtful whether the message bottles really are "diaries".`
`......After all, the amount of writing was massive.`
` It's hard to imagine that someone actually caught up in the middle of a serial murder like that would have been able to calmly write it down.`
`In that case, it's probably more realistic to say that these diaries were written slowly over a long period of time before the day prior to the accident.`
`In which case, .........would that mean that everything on Rokkenjima was {i:premeditated}, and prepared for over a long stretch of time...?`
`...The fact that Aunt Eva left this world without saying anything is...detestable.`
`She definitely told me on her deathbed.`
`She definitely said that her reason for not telling me the truth was because it was the best way of harassing me.`
`......Ah, by now I'm painfully aware of it.`
`Of all the things Aunt Eva did to harass me, this was probably the last and the greatest.`
`...............But now that I start to think of it this way, it's pretty doubtful that Aunt Eva is the true culprit.`
`Of course, this isn't because the handwriting in the message bottle differs from Aunt Eva's, or anything like that.`
`......It's because in both discovered tales, Aunt Eva was included among the victims.`
`If the writer of these diaries was the culprit...`
`......then maybe Aunt Eva had also been one of the targets to be killed.`
`Aunt Eva had survived because {i:something had gone wrong}.`
`.........Because of my hate for Aunt Eva, I had believed until now that she {i:had} to be the culprit.`
`But the existence of the message bottles...`
`......was making me suspect that the mastermind was a far more profound and unknown person than her...`
`I looked at the clock.`
` I'd asked everything I wanted to.`
`{n}Time to go.`
`As he continued to speak fervently, I volunteered that I wanted to bring this discussion to a close.`
`He seemed to be aware that he had gotten excited and talked too much, so he accepted this without resistance.`
`"Thank you very much for today.`
` I'm glad to have had the opportunity to hear your valuable stories."`
`"......No, no.`
` It was truly a joy to be able to welcome a young lady as a new friend of the Witch Hunt.`
` I have many precious documents that I couldn't show you because of this change to a different venue.`
` I should be glad to show you them at the next chance we get."`
`"Thank you, Professor.`
` ............Could I ask you one more thing?"`
`"Yes, what is it?"`
`"Professor, what made you interested in witches...no, in occultism and demonology?"`
`"I must admit, being asked that is somewhat embarrassing.`
` ......Simply put, I used to think that if only I could use magic, I wouldn't be beaten by the big school bully,`
` and this childhood fantasy of mine went straight on to become my life work.`
` Because the primitive yearning for power unknown is as universal today as it ever was in the past."`
`"Professor, if you could, would you want to become a witch?`
` Do you still dream of being able to use magic at will?"`
`"But of course.`
` Even though, at this age, I understand rationally that there is no such thing,`
` I find myself unable to forget my child‐like dreams of flying in the sky and turning scrap iron into gold.`
` ......Hahaha, if you would, please keep this a secret from my students."`
`".........If I told you that actually, I {i:am} a witch,`
` would you believe it?"`
`"Hahahaha.`
` It's my pet theory from my few experiences with women that they are {i:all} witches."`
`Ange snorted at the old professor, who was undoubtedly an earnest scholar, and unlikely had any experiences with women at all.`
`"Oh, yes.`
` And one final question.`
` ......Professor, have you seen the original message bottle itself?"`
`"I have indeed."`
`"In that case, are you also well acquainted with the handwriting?"`
`"Of course.`
` I am not a specialist in that area, but at least when it comes to the handwriting of the message bottle, I am proud to be the most knowledgeable in Japan."`
`At that point, Ange set a book on the table with a thud.`
`"............And this is?`
` I have never seen it before."`
`He prided himself on his thorough knowledge of all literature related to Rokkenjima, but he looked bewildered at this binding that he had never laid eyes on before...`
`Ignoring him, Ange silently flipped through the pages, opened to one of them, and showed him.`
`On that page was a handwritten paragraph beginning with "To my dear witch apprentice".`
`......And at the end, there was a signature in {ruby:katakana:capitals} that said "{f:5:Beatrice}".`
`"Wh‐what is............"`
`The instant he glanced at it,`
` his face went pale.`
` ......She knew the answer before asking, but Ange asked it aloud anyway.`
`"Does the handwriting in the paragraph on this page match the handwriting in the message bottles...?"`
`"W‐well, uhh...... I wou—I would have to take this home and investigate it in detail to, to...`
` ...P‐pardon me for asking, but what in the world is this book?!`
` Where did you...?!"`
`The man stretched out his hand, but Ange nimbly pulled it out of his reach.`
`{n}...As though telling him not to touch it with his filthy hands.`
`"Thank you.`
` Just that reaction is all I need.`
` Thank you very much for today.`
` ......Here is the reward I promised."`
`As she stood up, clutching Maria's diary,`
` Ange casually tossed a wad of ten‐thousand‐yen notes wrapped with a band of paper onto the table.`
`As she turned her back to him and made to leave, the man raised his voice as though clinging to her.`
`But Ange never stopped walking.`
`"I, I beg you...!!`
` What in the world is that book?!`
` I don't need a reward, just, please, show me that book...!!"`
`"......Both you and I are fellow Witch Hunters, but it looks like we aren't pursuing it at the same level.`
` You're entertaining yourself with the outside of the cat box.`
` And what I want to know about is the inside of the cat box."`
`"......And this book is the key to opening it.`
` It's too good for you.`
` Well then.`
` <Goodbye, gentlemen>. <Have a nice day>."`
`"P‐please, wait...!!`
` {i:Sumadera‐san}...!!!"`
`His voice didn't reach her.`
` She had already joined up with Amakusa and gone into the car......`
`"Did you find anything?"`
`"......At the very end.`
` I was right.`
` The one who wrote the message bottles was {f:5:Beatrice} herself."`
`"Now that's <cool>.`
` So it's settled, is it, the witch exists?"`
`"Who knows.`
` .........Mind if I sleep?`
` I'll bet that prattling professor gets lost in his own little world in lectures and has kids falling asleep left, right, and center."`
`"Sure, sure, take a rest."`
`".........Still, that went really well.`
` That guy believed I was Sumadera until the very end."`
`The Sumadera family had cast out a net beforehand over any people Ange might try to contact.`
`They had offered a reward for anyone who could detain Ushiromiya Ange if she appeared.`
`Ange had foreseen that and {i:snatched it away}.`
`She had called herself Sumadera, and after skillfully tricking the man by saying her own subordinates would set up an ambush, she had taken him with her.`
`So when the Sumadera pursuers reached the professor's house, there was no longer anyone there...`
`"According to the family, a young man and woman calling themselves Sumadera visited this morning,`
` took the professor out with them, and still have not returned.`
` ......There is a chance we were outmaneuvered."`
`"..................What a bad child that Ange‐chan is.`
` ......I wonder if that craftiness is from Nee‐san's blood.`
` ......To think that she would casually take on the name Sumadera after saying so often how she'd hate to call herself that..."`
`"............Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` ...The professor should be returning soon.`
` When he does, we must serve him some tea..."`
`"...Ye‐...yes.`
` Understood."`
`"..................I wonder if she thinks she's leading me around by the nose.`
` She is such a naughty child.`
` ............*giggle*giggle*, ......hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho{0}ho{0}ho{0}ho{0}hohoho!!"`
`With a demonic look on her face, Kasumi violently stamped her heel.`
`I'll teach you.`
`{n}About my Magic of Origins.`
`No, I taught you before, right?`
`{n}And you used to be able to use it.`
`{n}Did you forget......?`
`You were also a witch apprentice, Ange, with your name entered into Mariage Sorcière, weren't you......?`
`".........I also...joined in as one of the witches, didn't I..."`
`I closed Maria onee‐chan's diary and flopped down on a very high‐class‐looking bed.`
`Since I had fallen into a pretty deep sleep in the car, it was taking longer than usual for drowsiness to set in, and I had been spending a long time reading the diary as I waited for that.`
`This was a super‐expensive hotel in the city.`
` ...Expensive hotels that are often used by the rich and famous have an abnormally strong duty of confidentiality, out of concern for their various circumstances.`
`This made it a very convenient place for Ange, on the run from her pursuers.`
`The idea that runaways spend their nights hiding in cheap hotels is a commoner's way of thinking.`
`......For Ange, who possessed all the wealth of the Ushiromiya family, the life of a runaway was truly comfortable.`
`Of course, as a man, Amakusa was in a separate room despite being her guard.`
` Ange was using the bedroom of the suite, while Amakusa was lying down on the living room sofa.`
`...Amakusa said something about how the sofa here was more comfortable than his own bed recently.`
` Poor guy.`
`When I looked at the clock,`
` ......I saw that it was almost 2 a.m.`
`Still not getting sleepy.`
` ............I sighed deeply.`
`Even though there was no wind, I suddenly got the feeling that Maria onee‐chan's diary had fluttered open.`
`......Then, Onee‐chan appeared.`
`{n}Her form was no longer the normal one that I knew.`
`...She was wearing the dress that {f:5:Beatrice} had given her after acknowledging her status as a witch.`
`".........If you don't get some sleep, it'll be tough tomorrow, you know?"`
`"If I were a witch too,`
` ......I could use magic, right?"`
`"...Yep.`
` Could.`
` I taught you, didn't I?`
` How to use it.`
` ......And you were able to, once."`
`"...............I remember.`
` ......I've started wanting to."`
`"Did you get lonely...?"`
`"..................Not really.`
` ......It's not like having a different pillow every night is that tough."`
`".........The first step to magic can be loneliness, or boredom,`
` or any reason as small as that."`
`"Even killing time until you get tired?"`
`"Yep.`
` I'm happy that you remembered about magic one more time."`
`..............................`
`......It's been quite a long time since I last used magic.`
`At one point, with Maria onee‐chan's introduction, ......I touched a corner of it, and opened the door a tiny bit.`
`So, ......I should still remember that sensation.`
`"......Right now, your magical power has declined significantly, Ange.`
` ...If you don't stick to the basics, it'll be hard, okay?"`
`"Sure.`
` ...............Checking all directions.`
` Quiet space secured."`
`"What about Amakusa‐san?"`
`".....................`
` ............He's sleeping."`
`After opening the door to the living room a crack, I could see the blanket caterpillar on the sofa roll over in its sleep.`
`"......With your magical power as weak as it is now, the anti‐magic power is affecting you too much.`
` ......Not just the sight of people,`
` but voices, sounds, and even the presence of people will get in the way of your magic."`
`"......Sever those completely.`
` Like how ancient magicians shut themselves up in ateliers to preserve their isolation."`
`"I remember.`
` ......The very existence of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s blocks magic.`
` ...Therefore, the very act of showing magic to humans is the sign of a high‐level witch..."`
`Obtain a quiet space for yourself alone.`
`{n}......That should cover it for the preparation of a space to use magic.`
`".........Next is the vessel.`
` ...Right now, that's as important for you as a bicycle having training wheels—no, a chain."`
`"...........................`
` .........These would...`
`.........obviously...`
`not be possible, right..."`
`Ange rubbed her own head.`
`...She was wearing hair accessories with pink beads attached.`
`They felt a little childish for Ange's style, but she had never taken them off for a single day.`
`"..................Yeah.`
` .........That really is impossible for you right now, Ange.`
` ...If you had practiced every single day since then,`
` you might have become able to summon him by now."`
`"........................`
` If I were to start training now, how long would it take?"`
`".........It's said that a year of witch training as a child is worth ten in old age.`
` You'll need a strong resolution."`
`"You mean like Ushiromiya Kinzo?`
` ............So private tutoring from a young age is important for piano, violin and magic."`
`"Your power has weakened since the time you were first able to use magic, Ange.`
` ...Don't overdo it, and stick to the basics."`
`After regretfully rubbing the things on my head one more time, I let it go.`
`Then I started fishing through my knapsack.`
`{n}...Looking for anything that might make a good vessel.`
`"? ...Ah......"`
`"............Wouldn't this be perfect for a vessel?"`
`"It's been so long since I saw that.`
` ......Yeah.`
` I think even as you are now, you should be able to summon that one.`
` ...And she has no master now.`
` It should be possible for you to become her new master, Ange."`
`Among the things that looked like good vessels, I took the one I thought might possess the strongest magical power,`
` and set it on the side table near the bed with a clunk.`
`It was......a shady‐looking stake‐shaped weapon embellished with an occult design.`
`A stake of the "Seven Stakes of Purgatory", used by witches to offer sacrifices.`
`In the course of their search for evidence, the police had collected a large amount of junk.`
`{n}After the investigation had finished, this had been faithfully returned to the Ushiromiya family.`
`......I found something there that I had seen in the illustrations in Maria's diary, and took it home with me.`
`".........Originally, the Seven Stakes of Purgatory were a seven‐piece set.`
` ......Poor girl.`
` She's the only one left now."`
`Onee‐chan smiled, looking lonely...`
`I pulled another book out of the knapsack.`
`......This was another old‐fashioned, blatantly occult‐related book.`
`But this, too, was a book to be written in.`
`{n}It was one of Maria onee‐chan's elaborate notebooks.`
`This one was not a diary.`
`{n}......It was a grimoire, which she had written as a witch.`
`The Seven Stakes of Purgatory were {f:5:Beatrice}'s furniture.`
`{n}Created by her and employed only for her sake.`
`But since {f:5:Beatrice} was a witch of Mariage Sorcière, they could also be employed by {f:5:Maria}, who was a witch of the same alliance.`
`For that reason, the method of summoning the Seven Stakes of Purgatory and how to handle them was written about in great detail in Maria onee‐chan's grimoire...`
`And...`
`as another person with her name in the same alliance, I was also permitted to employ them.`
`".........This stake is...`
`.........which of the Seven Sisters?"`
`"Their characteristics are well described in my grimoire.`
` ...The Sisters of the Seven Stakes really hate it when you get their names wrong.`
` Remember their names well before summoning them."`
`A colossal number of pages telling of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory.`
`{n}...They described the seven sisters in great detail.`
`......Yes.`
` Quite a long time ago, I think I learned these pages almost by heart.`
`The more I read it, the more I start to remember...`
`By the illustrations and identifying characteristics written in the grimoire, I could tell that the stake in my hand was the "Stake of Mammon".`
`In the past, I had been summoning them without any vessel, because I never had any stakes.`
`......So this was the first time I had gotten a good look at any of the seven stakes, not just Mammon.`
`"Mammon.`
` The fifth sister.`
` Presides over the deadly sin of greed.`
` ......What an incredible kid."`
`"Greed also controls aspirations, the desire to improve oneself, and the strength to live.`
` It definitely doesn't mean only bad things.`
` ......She's rude, but she's a girl who tries really hard."`
`"......Yes.`
` You could say that without desire, there's no reason to live."`
`For a while, I heightened my concentration and digested the information that was written about Mammon.`
`......The more the summoner knows about the target that's being summoned, the better...`
` Knowledge brings about magical power.`
`......I began to fill my head with knowledge about Mammon, and build the necessary amount of magic power for the summoning.`
`"......Grimoires are a little bit interesting, aren't they.`
` Maybe much more interesting than reading some crappy novel.`
` ......And it really takes me back, somehow."`
`"For a grimoire, it is demanded not only that you understand the text, but that you expand the world from the gaps between the lines,`
` and give birth to a world from the illustrations, creating things in various ways."`
`"......The power to create.`
` For someone who has that, such as you, a grimoire should be more interesting than any book.`
` ...I've always known that you'd be able to understand that."`
`"............I think that should be enough knowledge of Mammon for now.`
` .........Yeah.`
` It's come back to me, more or less.`
` ...I'll give it a try."`
`"Take care.`
` ......In preparation for the worst, use my talisman.`
` ......You are not protected by the treaty of the alliance now.`
` That Mammon can be a little aggressive at times.`
` ...She {i:may still bear a grudge}.`
` Be careful."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...I think I'll wear it."`
`The Seven Stakes of Purgatory, as furniture for sacrificial rituals, are treated as beings inferior even to weapons.`
`But that is only when it comes to demons.`
`{n}To {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, even furniture is something to be feared.`
`I fished through the knapsack again,`
` took out a bracelet charm with a scorpion medal that I had gotten from Maria onee‐chan long ago, and put it on my arm.`
`......I had no need for something like this in the past.`
`{n}But I need insurance...`
`".........It's alright.`
` That is still endowed with a sufficient amount of magic defense.`
` As long as you have it on, I'm certain you'll be fine."`
`Maria onee‐chan's magical power, in particular the power she could put into charms, was enough to earn even {f:5:Beatrice}'s admiration.`
`......While it would only have looked like something cheap to a human who couldn't understand magic,`
` its magical worth was incalculable.`
`"..............................`
` Come, arise.`
` Forgive the sin.`
` ...One of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory.`
` Mammon the Covetous."`
`.....................`
`I concentrated my mind.`
`{n}I made the anti‐magic toxin that filled my body zero.`
`Imagine an vast, untainted space.`
`{n}......Doubts and common sense all resist magic.`
`Make the resistance zero, and erase the burden towards magical power......`
`..............................`
`{n}......Inside my head was the image of a vast space.`
`It was a nighttime world where I floated in the air and the neon stars on the ground sparkled.`
`A world where the stars that should have covered the heavens were drowned out by the light from below, and the stars covered the ground instead.`
`In the world of a vast night sky with no obstructions,`
` ......I imagined the wind blowing through freely.`
`Just then,`
` ......in that room where no wind could blow,`
` ......the free nighttime wind whirled around.`
`That long‐forgotten sensation raced through my entire body.`
`{n}............The unique feeling of exultation felt when using magic.`
`From Mammon's stake, held out in my hand, I gradually began to feel a pale light.`
`The cyclone gyred around the stake.`
`{n}......The hefty stake floated a bit into the air.`
`"............Wonderful.`
` ...Looks like the gap in your training hasn't stolen your talent."`
`"......Come, arise.`
` Forgive the sin.`
` ...One of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, Mammon the Covetous.`
` ......Show yourself to me......"`
`I slowly raised my hand, and as I brought it higher than my head,`
` almost as though it was being sucked upwards by it, the Stake of Mammon likewise floated high up into the air, ......and gradually began to shake.`
`Its shaking grew faster and faster,`
` .........and then it burst.`
`With a speed faster than the eye could follow, it flew around, violently rebounding off the walls of the room.`
`{n}......The terrible sound of it jumping from place to place bore down upon me, trying to make me flinch.`
`......But I mustn't lose my mental concentration.`
`Then, the stake, which had been flying around at an incredible speed, finally restrained itself and faced me.`
`......It was in the air, just a few centimeters away from my forehead...held back by the defensive barrier created by the scorpion charm.`
`It was trying to break the defensive barrier, eating into it with incredible power, but Maria onee‐chan's barrier wouldn't be broken so easily.`
`"...............No good...`
` I can't bite through it......"`
`The stake muttered hatefully.`
`......You could probably say that I had been saved thanks to the scorpion charm.`
`Without that, my way of killing time until I got sleepy would have become a way to kill time for all eternity.`
`When Mammon's stake realized that it was unable to gouge me, it gave up gracefully, and changed its form from that of a stake into that of a person.`
`In her usual shameless outfit which I would never be seen walking outside in.`
`{n}Although you could say it suited her, in a demonic sort of way.`
`".................Ange‐sama, is that you?`
` ............That's some pretty shabby magical power.`
` ...Are you really Ange‐sama?"`
`"It's been a long time, Mammon.`
` ......Have you been well?"`
`"...........................`
` ...And here I was convinced that furniture which has already fulfilled its function would just be left to rust away in a closet.`
` ......So, what kind of sideshow is this?`
` You aren't going to say that you're my owner, are you, Ange‐sama...?"`
`".........Yep.`
` Ange is your master."`
`"Lady {f:5:Maria}...`
` .........I am ashamed.`
` Was that barrier just now yours?"`
`"Yeah.`
` I thought that as Ange is now, she might just fall to you.`
` I lent her a talisman."`
`".....................`
` ......If I am told by Lady {f:5:Maria} that Ange‐sama is my master, I can hardly refuse.`
` .........Ange‐sama, I am yours to command.`
` Given that my assistance is required...is it a new ritual?`
` New sacrifices...?"`
`"Of course, that's only if you're willing to handle me yourself and get your own hands dirty."`
`".........That role isn't one I'm looking for anymore.`
` .........All you have to do is just talk with me, like you used to."`
`"...................................."`
`"........................"`
`".........Heheh.`
` ...Yes, if that is what you desire.`
` Furniture is furniture because it is used.`
` It is an honor just to be summoned.`
` Ange‐sama."`
`Mammon had a slightly complicated smile on her face.`
`......She had accepted Ange as her new master because Maria had told her to,`
` but it looked like she hadn't gotten over her discontent at working for Ange with her frail magical power.`
`Or perhaps she had some other reason for hating Ange,`
` ......but for now, it seemed that she couldn't disobey Ange despite her discontent.`
`".........So?`
` What should I do?"`
`"I don't know.`
` .........Just be lively.`
` Like old times."`
`"With all due respect,`
` I think this liveliness you speak of is probably the bustle from when we sisters are together.`
` It may be difficult by myself.`
` ......Perhaps it slipped your mind?"`
`"......Yeah.`
` The Seven Sisters {i:were} really lively when they got together.`
` ......But with your magical power now, I think summoning Mammon is the best we can hope for.`
` The stakes for the other six have been lost."`
`"My apologies, Lady {f:5:Maria},`
` but I believe it may not be impossible to summon the Seven Sisters via my own stake.`
` ......If Ange‐sama is to employ me, I would hope that she has at least that much power......?"`
`Mammon giggled.`
`......Apparently, she wanted me to summon the other sisters without a vessel.`
`I see.`
` Unable to be satisfied with being summoned alone, she asks for the other sisters to be summoned as well.`
`...I get it—greed.`
` Yes, she was like this back then, wasn't she......`
`.........Bliss for furniture is when it is used.`
` Being used, no matter how roughly, is furniture's joy.`
`Not only that, but no matter how much care you might treat them with, if they are not given a job, that would give them the greatest anguish.`
`Mammon spoke as though to provoke me, but what she wanted was for me to summon the other sisters somehow and rescue them from the world of nothingness.`
`.........Why not just be honest and ask me to, then?`
`{n}Demons really are difficult.`
`".........Ange.`
` Don't overdo it.`
` Just being able to summon Mammon is more than enough rehabilitation."`
`"Oh, I'm rehabilitated after just one?`
` I'm just killing time anyway.`
` .........Alright, Mammon.`
` In for a penny, in for a pound.`
` I'll call as many as I can for you."`
`"Really......?!`
` Niiice, Ange‐sama!`
` Alright, go go go!"`
`Even though she had said it, it seemed that Mammon hadn't really expected to be able to ask this of Ange.`
`She hopped around, badgering Ange to summon the other sisters.`
`......The consumption of physical and magical power used to call Mammon alone was considerable.`
`{n}...It will probably be pretty tough to do six more.`
`......I'm in awe of the magical power of those who reach the level of being called witches, because those people can summon these sisters with no more than a snap of their fingers.`
`"Mammon, don't make Ange overdo it.`
` She still isn't back to form yet..."`
`"Whaaaa?!`
` Ange‐sama said that she'd summon everyone!"`
`Actually, I only said that I'd call as many as I could.`
`{n}......Guess this is greed.`
`"Don't overdo it, Ange.`
` You should rest for today.`
` You're tired enough."`
`"It's alright.`
` I'm just killing time anyway.`
` Let me get tired enough so I can just keel over."`
`......This time there's no vessel.`
`I'll have to strengthen the image solely from the knowledge in the grimoire, and manifest them just with that.`
`I held my hands out into the air, replaying in my head the sensation from when I had summoned Mammon......`
`Come on, I know all of the Seven Sisters personally.`
` ......Remember, in the past,`
` ......the times I talked with them.........`
`Once again, ......the power of magic began to fill me up.`
` It radiated as a faint, and yet distinct pale blue light from both of my hands......`
`"Ange‐sama...!`
` Keep it up, keep it up, do your best...!`
` Hey, Lady {f:5:Maria}.`
` Ange‐sama will definitely summon everyone, right?`
` The Seven Sisters will get to be reunited again, right?`
` Right?!"`
`"Yeah, I'm sure of it.`
` ......But there's no guarantee that it will happen tonight."`
`"No, Ange‐sama can do it, I just know it...!`
` Please, Ange‐sama...!`
` Start from the youngest sister, Asmo...!"`
`".........Asmodeus.`
` The seventh sister.`
` ...............OK.`
` I'll call them in order starting from the youngest."`
`A strand of hot sweat dripped down from my forehead.`
`{n}......This really does put one hell of a strain on you.`
`The pale light in this space......began to form into the vague outline of a girl...`
`".........Come, arise.`
` One of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, Asmodeus the Lustful..."`
`There was no vessel.`
` ......However, with the strong core conviction that she definitely did exist there, ......I began to crystallize her form...`
`Her outline became distinct, .........and the form of the youngest of the Seven Sisters, Asmodeus, was finally created.`
`"Asmodeus the Lustful, right here......`
` .........Where is this?`
` Am I alive......?"`
`"Asmo...!!`
` I'm so glad!!"`
`"Mammon nee‐san!`
` ......Where in the world is this?`
` Who summoned me?"`
`"Ange‐sama did...!`
` Ange‐sama said she'd revive all of us...!"`
`...No I didn't.`
`"Ange‐sama, thank you!`
` Next is Belzie...!!`
` Do Belzie please...!"`
`"......Beelzebub.`
` The sixth sister.`
` ......Beelzebub the Gluttonous.`
` Come, arise..."`
`If I just keep on like this, ......I wonder how many I can summon.`
`{n}If I lose my concentration,`
` ...that'll probably be it.`
`The pale light made an outline, .........and formed into Beelzebub.`
`"Beelzebub the Gluttonous, right here......"`
`"Belzieee!!"`
`"Ange‐sama, awesome, awesome!!"`
`Mammon and Asmodeus jumped on Beelzebub, celebrating their reunion.`
`......Summoning three people at once.`
` ...My head was throbbing.`
`Without resting, I summoned the next one.`
`"......Come, arise.`
` One of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, Belphegor the Slothful..."`
`"Belphegor the Slothful, right here.`
` .........My, ...to think that I would still be needed..."`
`"Belphe‐neeeeee!`
` I'm huuungryyy!`
` I mean—I'm so glad to see you again!!"`
`"To think that the Seven Sisters would be able to meet again...`
` Ange‐sama, we are truly thankful!"`
`"Keep it up and do Satan‐nee next!`
` And Levia‐nee and Luci‐nee...!!"`
`".........Yes,`
` ...I know.`
` ......So please, try not to be so loud.`
` ......Doing four people at the same time...`
`...is pretty...tough..."`
`"Ange, don't push yourself any more than this.`
` You did a great job summoning four of them after such a long time."`
`"...Stop it, Mammon.`
` Our summoning is placing a heavy strain on Ange‐sama right now.`
` Ange‐sama, I beg you not to push yourself too hard..."`
`"No way!`
` Ange‐sama promised!`
` She said she'd play with all of us again!"`
`...No I d—...`
`"Didn't you!`
` Ange‐sama!`
` You said we'd all meet again!`
` You promised we'd be able to see each other again soon!"`
`"........................"`
`".........You're right, .........I did.`
` ......I didn't promise anything about when "soon" would be, ......but I certainly did...promise."`
`"So keep that promise!`
` If you don't, I'll never forgive you for forgetting it until today...!"`
`"..................`
` ......Come, arise.`
` One of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, Satan the Wrathful..."`
`My mind was starting to get hazy...`
` ......But...I'll call.`
`I may have forgotten those days.`
`{n}I may not have thought of them as anything but sadness and loneliness.`
`......But certainly...the short time I spent with these girls...`
`...was, without a doubt, fun.`
`"Satan the Wrathful, right here.`
` ............What the hell are you people doing!!`
` Do you realize how much it's burdening Ange‐sama just for us to have an idle chat?!"`
`Satan, who had apparently figured out the situation immediately after being summoned, yelled out in a loud voice, telling her sisters off.`
`......That loud voice made my consciousness fade again.`
`"We are furniture that has been permitted rest by {f:5:Beatrice}, furniture that has finished its duty!`
` Not content to be graced with the opportunity to once again be of some use, you are putting a burden on your new master—this is a DISGRACE to furniture!!`
` Erase yourselves RIGHT NOW!!"`
`"Yes, it's like Satan‐nee says.`
` I'll erase myself.`
` And you all vanish too.`
` In this moment, that is the best way for us to be of use to Ange‐sama."`
`"No way.`
` Not until everyone gets summoned!"`
`"No way for me too!`
` I'm hungryyy!`
` I mean—we only just met up again, I don't wanna go back already!"`
`"Don't be so selfish!!`
` Come on, hurry up and vanish!!`
` Come on, Asmo!`
` Disappear right now!!"`
`"Waaaah, Satan‐nee's bullying me...!`
` It's always me first because I'm the youngest, it's not faaair!"`
`".........Ahh, they really are lively.`
` ......They never make you.........bored......"`
`"That's enough.`
` You've surpassed your limits for now, Ange."`
`"......You're...`
`...right...`
` ........................"`
`This situation where I had summoned five of them, and they were messing around as they pleased,`
` was placing far too heavy a load on me currently, with my meager magic power......`
`......This is...............it......`
`As my consciousness grew distant, I collapsed onto the bed.`
`......Have beds always felt this soft......?`
`{n}........................`
`It seemed that the sisters were still squabbling together as much as they liked.`
`......For a way to kill time until drowsiness comes to get me,`
` ......this will do............`
`Feeling something warm and nostalgic in the sisters' liveliness, I sank into a world of deep sleep.........`
`At the entrance to my dream world, I felt Maria onee‐chan,`
` ......and Sakutarou, waiting to receive me.`
`"...............`
` You worked hard.`
` ......And...good job."`
`‘Uryu.`
` ...Welcome back, Ange...’`
`......Welcome back, huh...`
` Then I should respond like this.`
`............Glad to be home.........`
`That's right.`
` Just once in the past, I underwent training in order to step into the world of witches.`
`I accepted that the only power which could save me from my sad, painful days at Saint Lucia Academy...`
`was the thing called magic, and I received Maria onee‐chan's introduction to the basics......`
`"...............Imagine...a vast space......`
` ......The scenery when I looked down at the base of the mountain, from the rest stop at the peak......"`
`".........Like this......?"`
`I projected that scene from a memory into my mental world.`
`......Normal little girls get over their admiration of magical girls during elementary school.`
`Training in absolute earnest to use magic at this age......I have to say, I'm embarrassed of myself.`
`But even that embarrassed emotion felt pleasant to me now.`
`Right now, I was learning mental concentration from Maria onee‐chan in order to use magic.`
`But it wasn't going very well.`
` ......It was about as hopeless as going to a person who can wiggle their ears,`
` asking them how they do it, and expecting to learn anything at all from their demonstration...`
`It seems that you need to imagine a vast space to gain the mental concentration for using magic.`
`So I remembered the time from my younger days when my family had gone on a small vacation,`
` and I had looked down towards the base of a mountain from a viewing platform at a rest stop on the peak—and I tried painting this scene in my mental world.`
`"No, still far too small.`
` Imagine a much, much wider space.`
` And create your very own mental world."`
`"Your image is still far too foggy.`
` There's no temperature in the air, and there's no wind.`
` No smells either.`
` The world is still very thin.`
` ......You can leave those for later, so for now, just imagine a wider space."`
`‘Uryu.`
` ......Why do you have to imagine a wide space?’`
`"From the time they're born, {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s have inside them a toxin that blocks magic.`
` If you don't purge yourself of that toxin, you can't use magic well.`
` ...One effective method of achieving this is to imagine a vast space."`
`".........Just now, I thought of the world as seen from the window of an airplane, but that didn't work either.`
` ......A world more vast than that,`
` ......I can't even imagine."`
`‘In that case, Maria, why don't you just tell Ange about the vast world you have...!`
` Won't that make it easy for Ange to imagine as well?`
` Uryu!’`
`"......That's right.`
` And I'm interested in the kind of world you imagine when you use magic, too, Onee‐chan.`
` ...I'll use it as a reference as well."`
`"Uu, won't work.`
` The mental world must be vast and isolated.`
` A world with absolutely no obstructions other than yourself."`
`"......Which means, if you tell someone about that world, it won't be isolated anymore.`
` So you can't reveal your mental world to anyone.`
` So if you manage to draw up a good mental world, you have to keep it a secret only for yourself."`
`‘Uryu...`
` Maria's a meanie‐face...’`
`"Thanks, Sakutaro.`
` I guess there are no shortcuts in training.`
` ......I'll make an effort.`
` It's alright, I've been given plenty of hints."`
`‘Uryu...!`
` Do your best, Ange...!’`
`I had come to think that there was no way I could be saved by something like magic.`
`{n}After all, magic doesn't exist in this world.`
`{n}That kind of thing should be nothing more than a fantasy, a delusion, a daydream.`
`......However, Maria onee‐chan had shown that she could fill her own world with happiness using a power that was impossible for me.`
`I had been looking down on that happiness as an empty happiness.`
`......I had been denying it all, thinking that because I didn't accept magic, I couldn't accept the happiness that came from it either.`
`But Maria onee‐chan's world grew happier and happier.`
`In the past, I had disparaged it, calling it painful to look at.`
`But......that might have been nothing more than jealousy.`
`{n}It was time for me to admit that.`
`And doing so was my first step in my search for happiness...`
`A vast space.`
` A dry wind that can blow unobstructed by everything.`
`{n}......Let me feel that wind blowing through my hair.`
`......Oh...yes, even the ground might block me as I am now.`
`Then I don't need it.`
`............Push the ground away, downwards, downwards.`
`In other words, ......it was as though I had floated up, leaving the ground far behind.`
`After pushing it further and further downwards,`
` ...the ground grew foggy and faint, ......and for the first time, I began to feel the sky.`
`.........Then, I understood its vastness.`
`In that instant, I felt the vivid wind pass straight through my body—in other words, blow through without any resistance.`
`"....................................`
` ......Yes.`
` Maintain that sensation."`
`"......Yes, I can feel it.`
` ......I can tell that I've been......released from all hindrances."`
`‘You did it, Ange, you did it, Ange...!`
` You've taken your first step into the world of witches...!’`
`"..................This is...the world of witches......?"`
`"Yeah.`
` So, let's try practicing the magic that you've always wished for, Ange.`
` .........Magic to summon friends.`
` ......Magic to create allies who will save you from your loneliness, and thereby bring you happiness."`
`‘Will Ange also be able to summon friends like me?!`
` Uryu‐uryu!’`
`"......As Ange is now, it's still far too early for her to summon a friend of your caliber from the sea of zero.`
` ......For now, let's just start by practicing with friends that are easier to summon."`
`".....................`
` ...What will we begin with...?"`
`"Because you are a witch of Mariage Sorcière,`
` you are also permitted to use those who are employed by other witches in the alliance."`
`"......For example, Sakutaro is my friend, but since you're in the same alliance, Ange, he's your friend too, and you can summon him.`
` ......You wanna try summoning Sakutaro one of these days?`
` When you're feeling all alone and it's really getting you down, I'm sure Sakutaro will cheer you up."`
`Oh, right.`
` You could call Sakutaro a being employed by Onee‐chan.`
`So as a witch in the same alliance as Onee‐chan, it's also possible for me to summon Sakutaro......`
`I met Sakutaro's gaze.`
`......What a joy it would be to have him just be sitting there by my pillow,`
` so he could talk to me a bit on lonely nights.`
`"......If I call out, will you appear,`
` ......and talk to me......?"`
`‘Uryuu!`
` I'm looking forward to you summoning me!`
` Uryu‐uryu‐uryu!’`
`Looking happy, Sakutaro playfully pressed and rubbed his head against me like a cat.`
`Suddenly getting this cute younger brother......left me feeling a bit confused, a bit embarrassed, and a bit happy.`
`.........Unable to understand why I hadn't been able to honestly accept this feeling, I felt tears well up in my eyes.`
`"Okay.`
` ......I'll give it all I've got, Onee‐chan."`
`"Then let's try and practice.`
` .........Let's try summoning the furniture of a witch from the same alliance—{f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"............{f:5:Beatrice}'s...furniture."`
`Hearing {f:5:Beatrice}'s name mentioned gave me a slightly strange feeling.`
`When it came to the crime on Rokkenjima, the public had made a lot of noise about it being a witch's sacrificial ritual or something like that.`
`......And that witch was {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`So {i:if} the culprit of that crime was a witch,`
` ......it would mean that this very woman was the culprit who took away my family.`
`However, according to Maria onee‐chan, {f:5:Beatrice} was a good witch.`
`If I held negative emotions towards {f:5:Beatrice},`
` she would get mad, argue with me and call me mean, and refuse to talk to me for a while.`
`......Onee‐chan was my only close friend right now.`
`...So to avoid worsening the mood of my close friend,`
` I had decided to think of {f:5:Beatrice} as nothing more than Onee‐chan's magic master...`
`......And anyway, my belief is that the crime was a murder plot hatched by Aunt Eva.`
`......Someday I'm definitely gonna bring that all to light.........`
`"Ange.`
` Obstructions are mingling inside your body again."`
`".........Sorry, I lost my concentration.`
` ...One more time..."`
`Onee‐chan is really something...`
`{n}She instantly noticed that I was being overcome with idle thoughts.`
`After shaking my head just once, I reimagined the wind blowing through the vast sky...`
`"............The Seven Sisters of Purgatory?`
` That's a pretty creepy name."`
`"But they're very energetic and fun girls.`
` They might become your new friends, Ange.`
` ......I'll summon them first.`
` Watch."`
`Maria onee‐chan lifted both hands up to the level of her head, and quietly unified her mind.`
`......The state that I could not attain without meditating for a long period of time, she reached in the span of a few quick breaths.`
`Then, a pale blue light began to gather in her palms, .........and one by one, the girls began to show themselves.`
`One, two, three.`
` Four, five, six, seven...`
`The way they were summoned one after another in a line was overwhelmingly impressive.`
`......Incredible.`
` The Seven Sisters of Purgatory, ......just like the illustrations in Onee‐chan's grimoire...`
`The younger sisters were behind the eldest, Lucifer, who saluted Onee‐chan.`
`"The Seven Sisters of Purgatory, right here...!`
` Lady {f:5:Maria}, it has been quite some time."`
`"Yep.`
` Long time no see.`
` Are you all doing okay...?"`
`"We furniture are furniture because we are used.`
` I consider it an honor from my very heart to have been summoned again for the first time in a long while!"`
`"Kyaa{p:0:♪} Sakutaroo!`
` It's been so looong!"`
`"You look as deli—I mean—cute as ever~!!"`
`"I'm fi~rst!!`
` Kyaa, he's so fluffy, squishy, and cuuu~te!"`
`"A~h!!`
` Let me hug him too, let me hug him too~!"`
`‘U‐uryuu!`
` Can't brea~the!`
` I won't run away, so let me go, everyo~ne!’`
`"Hey!!`
` Are you trying to break Lady {f:5:Maria}'s furniture?!`
` Just get away from him, hugging is prohibited!!"`
`"......And yet you're the one who looks like you want to hug him the most.`
` *snicker*."`
`"Wh—?!`
` I, I don't have any i‐interest in something so...fluffy and...squishy and...cuddly, okay?!"`
`"Hey!!`
` Be silent in the presence of Lady {f:5:Maria} and Ange‐sama, you cretinous sisters!!"`
`They were so energetic...`
`{n}The sudden burst of activity as soon they appeared left me stunned.`
`And even greater than that was my surprise that the innocent Sakutaro was on such good terms with the Seven Sisters.`
`"......That's unexpected.`
` To think that Sakutaro would be so loved by such a dangerous bunch of people."`
`"They're fellow members of the same alliance.`
` There's nothing to be scared of, you know?"`
`"But if Sakutaro were to do something to upset them, it looks like they could finish him off in an instant..."`
`"It's alright.`
` The witches of the alliance and their furniture are all friendly with each other.`
` So Sakutaro can play without worrying.`
` ......Of course, that goes for you and me too, Ange."`
`One of the treaties of Mariage Sorcière.`
`{n}"Mutual nonaggression and noninterference".`
`Member witches must respect each other's magic and creations.`
`Even the sisters, who were normally extremely combative and dangerous, interacted with fellow alliance members as friends.`
`So to the Seven Sisters, Sakutarou was a common friend.`
`He was loved by all of the Seven Sisters, and they were even trying to steal him away from each other.`
`This scene as they all surrounded him and loved him was actually a bit charming.`
`"......I see.`
` They're fellow members of Mariage Sorcière."`
`At a glance, you'd think that Sakutaro's easygoing atmosphere and the Seven Sisters' unsettling one would be like water and oil.`
` They looked like they'd never be compatible.`
`And yet, they were interacting in such a friendly way, as if it was completely natural......`
`If all the peoples of the world could be joined in this wonderful alliance,`
` ......I wonder if the whole world could immediately become friends.`
`"All you Seven Sisters, listen.`
` Right now, Ange is in the middle of magic training.`
` So I want all of you to lend her your power."`
`"Certainly, Lady {f:5:Maria}.`
` ...But what specifically?"`
`"I will move the magical power manifesting you from me to Ange.`
` I want you to stay close by her all the time in that state.`
` All you have to do is talk with her and stuff like that."`
`".........My apologies,`
` but with Ange‐sama's magical power, I suspect that it will not be easy for her to continually summon all seven of us around the clock..."`
`The oldest sister, Lucifer, gauged my reaction as she advised this, speaking reservedly.`
`...In short, she was saying that the burden might be too heavy for me at this point in time.`
`"That's the kind of training it is.`
` Ange has more talent and magical power than you all imagine.`
` I think it'll be a little bit tough, but I think it's worth it for Ange to take this challenge as she is now."`
`"......Ange.`
` I will now switch the magic power manifesting them over to you.`
` ......Basically, you'll be in the same state as if you'd summoned them yourself."`
`So what Maria onee‐chan was trying to say was something like this.`
`To keep the Seven Sisters manifested, you are burdened continuously with a significant amount of magical power.`
`......Maybe you could say it was like training while wearing weighted wristbands.`
`‘Uryu......`
` Doing all of the Seven Sisters will be pretty tough......`
` Isn't that asking a lot of Ange all of a sudden...?’`
`"Thanks, Sakutaro.`
` But this is my training to become a witch.`
` I want to give it my best."`
`......The seven of them certainly do seem boisterous.`
` But even if they're doing it for the sake of my training,`
` having them be with me will surely distract me from my loneliness, at least a little.`
`I understood it would be an ordeal, but before anything else, I wanted to give it a shot.`
`"Don't overdo it if it gets tough, alright?`
` And everyone, if Ange looks like she's having a hard time, tone it down for her."`
`"Certainly.`
` You got that, people?!"`
`""""""Yeeees, Onee‐samaa!""""""`
`"Well then, Ange‐sama.`
` We, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, will now become your furniture.`
` .........Lady {f:5:Maria}, if you would."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Okay, Ange.`
` Can we start?"`
`"......Sure.`
` ...I'm a little nervous."`
`‘Uryu...`
` This might be tough all of a sudden...`
` If you feel like you're getting a headache, lower your magic power right away......’`
`"Okay, I'll move the source of magic power over to you now, Ange............"`
`"....................."`
`"...............gh—"`
`Instantly, the inside of my head felt very heavy.`
`......This is......`
`yes,`
` .........it's tough...`
`Until then, the inside of my head had been used only for myself.`
`{n}It was almost like it was now also being used for seven other people.`
`......Their mere presence there, blinking, or even letting out a single breath, was placing an enormous weight on the inside of my head...`
`"......Lady {f:5:Maria}.`
` My apologies, but I fear that the burden of all of the Seven Sisters at once might be too great after all."`
`"I, ......I'm alright.........`
`......ack........."`
`"...Mmmm...`
` Maybe it's no good after all.`
` You're using all of your energy to manifest them.`
` If it's such a burden that you can't balance it with your everyday life, there's no point.`
` I mean, this is a little...unrefined for a witch."`
`‘Uryu...`
` I said doing so many all of a sudden was impossible...`
` Everyone, disappear a little bit and make it easier for her...’`
`"Yes.`
` It seems it would be better to lower the number of people.`
` ......Asmo, erase yourself."`
`"Me agaaain?`
` I'm opposed to youngest‐sister‐bullyi~ng!!`
` Start from the top every once in a whi~le!"`
`"But that would mean {i:I'd} have to disappear {i:second}!`
` No no noooo!"`
`"Don't make a ruckus, Asmo and Levia‐nee!!`
` That kind of disturbance will put even more strain on Ange‐sama!!"`
`"The noise you're making is straining her as well, stupid Satan!!"`
`"Eek!"`
`".........aah, .........ack......`
`......gah........."`
`The Seven Sisters started arguing over who should vanish first.`
` ......All the energy of that fight became a burden, imposing an even greater headache upon Ange...`
`In the end, they decided the order with rock‐paper‐scissors, and they began to disappear—one of them...two...three.`
`But even at that level, Ange was still far from comfortable.`
`In the end, I was finally able to calm my breathing once six of them had erased themselves.`
`With my magical power, forget the Seven Sisters, just one of them is my limit...`
`"......Aaa~aah, this way it's not the Seven Sisters, it's just me.`
` You're not very dependable, Ange‐sama."`
`Mammon, who had won her way through the rock‐paper‐scissors and received permission to remain until the end, complained.`
`‘Uryu...`
` Mammon, you mustn't say such a thing...`
` Ange is still just starting her training.`
` ......Are you okay, Ange?`
` Is your headache okay...?’`
`Sakutaro stretched on his tiptoes and did little hops trying to pat Ange's head.`
`Watching this, Maria scratched her head, acknowledging that this sudden training had been too difficult.`
`"Uu.`
` Maybe that was a little too austere.`
` This much is no problem at all for me, though.`
` The more friends you have, the more fun it is, after all."`
`".........Now I'm even more aware of how incredible you are, Onee‐chan..."`
`According to Maria onee‐chan, when you reach her class, you can even summon enough people at once to make up an orchestra.`
`And yet she calls herself a witch {i:apprentice}—that's awe‐inspiring...`
`"Are you alright?`
` Ange‐samaa?"`
`"...............I'm sorry...`
` It looks like summoning you is the most I can do."`
`"Well, I guess I'm alright with that.`
` After all, of all the Seven Sisters, I get the role of Ange‐sama's furniture all to myself.`
` ......What do you think, Ange‐sama?`
` Will I be a burden by myself?"`
`"No, I can manage you alone somehow..."`
`"Great!`
` Then please train a lot and cultivate a lot of magic power.`
` And someday, please let me serve you as one of the fully assembled Seven Sisters.`
` Promise?"`
`After checking that there was at least nothing wrong with her own manifestation,`
` Mammon immediately returned to a good mood, and tried to make me promise to work even harder.`
`Yes, I can see the greed in her.`
`{n}...But maybe you could also call it positivity.`
`"......Yes.`
` I promise.`
` ...I have to be able to do at least that much someday."`
`"Thank you, Ange‐sama!`
` Until that day, I, Mammon the Covetous, will serve you without fail...!"`
`My headache finally abated, and I relaxed both hands, which had been clutching at my head.`
`{n}Then Mammon stuck out her hand, and helped me to stand back up...`
`‘Uryu?`
` ......Ah.`
` ......Maria, Ange, look at the time.`
` You'll get told off if you don't go back to the room now.’`
`".........Huh?`
` ............Oh..."`
`I hadn't expected Sakutaro to talk about the time.`
`{n}......I was brought back into reality.`
`As though the light had disappeared from it, the vast world sank into the darkness,`
` .........and I was in a tiny, tiny bathroom stall, sitting on a toilet...`
`Onee‐chan's grimoire was open on my lap.`
`I looked at the clock.`
` ......It was almost 8 p.m., time for lights out.`
`If I show up late for the roll call before lights out, not only do they make an annoying fuss about it, but it causes trouble for my roommates and floormates as well.`
`......I couldn't care less about causing them trouble, but I'd rather not have to deal with the annoying interference that would come as a result...`
`Hahh............`
` That's the end of my me‐time for today.`
` I'll go to bed, wake up, tomorrow will begin, and another long, long, gray‐colored day will repeat again.`
`I closed the grimoire and rose from the toilet seat...`
`Onee‐chan appeared again and spoke.`
`"......Come on, Ange.`
` You're forgetting your training.`
` ............Take Mammon with you."`
`I'd forgotten.`
` ...The moment I'd returned to reality, I'd stopped manifesting Mammon...`
`One more time, I created a strong image of the existence of Mammon in my mind...`
`"Sheesh, you're so mean, Ange‐sama.`
` Erasing me suddenly like that...!`
` At this rate, you're going to find it pretty hard to call all of the Seven Sisters, you know!"`
`"............I'm sorry.`
` I got careless."`
`"It's been a super long time since I've manifested in the human world, so I'm interested in absolutely everything.`
` I'm feeling a little bit excited.`
` Where is this?"`
`".........The Saint Lucia Academy dormitory.`
` This is a stall in the communal bathroom.`
` ......Each room has its own bathroom, so no one comes here.`
` It's quiet, and perfect for reading books."`
`"In this dorm, you have to hide in a toilet stall even to read a book?`
` Do they burn them or something?"`
`..................`
`I have a double room, so my roommate is always there.`
`{n}Our relationship is strained, and it feels like I'm always being ignored.`
`{n}......The atmosphere's bad, so it's really not a place I can relax.`
`And it's good for her as well—as long as I'm not there, she can go all out, call her friends and have a chatting party.`
`It's more convenient for her too if I don't return until just before lights out.`
`There's also the library, but the group that uses that as a meeting place is constantly whispering about me.`
`So I don't like to go to the library either.`
`......During lunch, it's the bushes behind the school building.`
`{n}During the night, it's the stall in the communal bathroom in the dorms.`
`Those are the only hideaways where I can be given peace...`
`I opened the door to the stall, ......and went out.`
`I turned around, signaling with my eyes for Mammon to come with me.`
`"............I'm not sure I really understand, but I get the point that you find it pretty hard to call this place comfortable.`
` Let's hurry up and get out.`
` I hate the air here."`
`"Really?`
` .........You can't breathe this easy anywhere else."`
`When I left the bathroom and exited into the corridor,`
` because it was near lights out, all the girls who had gone to play in other rooms were dashing back to their own.`
`When it came time for lights out, we had to change into uniform pajamas that we hated and called prison clothes,`
` line up in the hallway, and go through the dorm leader's roll call.`
`......If by some chance someone were to be late for this,`
` we would be made to take collective responsibility, and all of us floormates would have to undergo a punishment that went by the name of volunteer work...`
`As long as I took care to avoid this, the girls would disregard me coldly, but they wouldn't get in my way.`
`......That alone was enough for me.`
`Mammon looked at the passing girls and the furnishings of the dorm with interest.`
`......Without paying her any particular attention, I hurried back to my room.`
`In front of my room was my roommate, who had already changed into her prison clothes, chatting with some girls from the room next door.`
`When they noticed me hurrying back, they blatantly changed the topic of their conversation.`
`They lowered their voices, stealing glances at me.`
`I acted like I didn't notice, went into my room, changed.`
`{n}And hurriedly went out into the corridor.`
`Everyone was already lined up.`
`".........Hey, this is weird.`
` Isn't this a school for rich girls?`
` It's like a prison.`
` This is dumb."`
`"It is, isn't it?`
` I think so too.`
` And you could say the thing that makes it even harsher than a prison is that you don't get out early for good behavior."`
`......After bitching for a bit, I noticed.`
`Having someone to listen to your complaints...`
`...feels surprisingly good.`
`Fortunately, Mammon's form can only be seen by the summoner, me.`
`{n}And of course, there's no need to speak out loud for this conversation.`
`All I have to do is speak inside my mind, so no one can listen in.`
`.........Magic, and the friends created by it,`
` ......might actually not be so bad.`
`"These guys, all of them look so scrawny.`
` It's like they're not even alive.`
` Kyahahaha."`
`"Stop it.`
` If they happen to see you, it'll be pretty bad..."`
`"Humans without a fragment of hopes or dreams are like a lump of anti‐magic.`
` They'll never be able to see me.`
` They're inferior life‐forms who can't even see.`
` *giggle*giggle*!"`
`".........Are you alright being around so many {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s with that anti‐magic toxin?"`
`"I'm fine as long as you continue to manifest me, Ange‐sama."`
`"......Although, you probably have to keep concentrating to do that, so there's a chance you'll neglect your daily life.`
` ......Look, aren't you being called by that girl you're sharing a room with?"`
`"......Huh?`
` .........Ah—"`
`"Ushiromiya‐san, are you listening?`
` It's us two on duty next week—I wanted to have a little talk..."`
`......Probably about pushing a few more chores onto me.`
`{n}My roommate, who normally would never even look me in the eye, was smiling at me unpleasantly.`
`But I'll have a much easier time having the weekly duty pushed onto me and doing it alone, rather than being forced to do it with her.`
`That's a small price to pay to have her continue to ignore me...`
`Yet after the shameless excuses,`
` she transitioned into pushing a completely different point, insisting on flipping the issue on its head, as if I should have come forward and done it of my own initiative.`
`......One of the special traits of this academy is that it's full of girls who don't know how to ask a favor.`
`"......What's {i:her} problem?`
` She pisses me off.`
` I'd love to just gouge her right in the forehead."`
`"Yes.`
` I'll take you up on that sometime."`
`...........................`
` ......Yeah.`
` Having a friend nearby all the time to complain to......makes me happier than I thought it would.`
`The Seven Sisters really were lively when they were all gathered together.`
`......I'm sure that just watching them mess around would be a lot of fun.`
`......I've decided. I'll do all I can to quickly gain the magical power to summon all of the Seven Sisters at once.`
`And then I'll keep training, more and more and more,`
` ......and summon...`
`......the thing that I really want to summon.`
`".........?`
` What is it that you really want to summon, Ange‐sama?"`
`Mammon noticed my conversation with myself inside my head, and asked about it blankly.`
`I hesitated over whether to talk about it, but then thought that it wasn't anything to hide, and told her.`
`"..................My family.`
` .........Dad.`
` Mom.`
` Onii‐chan."`
`"So you mean, the souls of the dead...?`
` Calling forth a resident of another world is called "summoning", but calling back the souls of the dead is "resurrection", and they're completely different.`
` ......Resurrection is supposed to be very high‐level magic."`
`I know.`
` ......So much so that even Maria onee‐chan can't do it at all.`
` But that's the thing I most want to call with magic.`
`......I've been warned that it's a very difficult high‐level magic.`
`{n}...So great that, in the worst case, I might not necessarily reach that point even after training for my whole life.`
`Furthermore, I have no vessel.`
` A vessel is something vital for making magic succeed, whether it be summoning or resurrection.`
`Because I don't have one, .........what would already have been difficult magic instead became hopeless.`
`That's right.`
` I have nothing to remember Mom or Dad by.`
`However, ......by an extraordinary coincidence...`
`{n}I do have something to help me remember Onii‐chan.`
`And that's.........this.`
`"......That hair accessory with the pink beads?`
` What {i:is} that? Sorry to say it, but it looks a little cheap for you."`
`"Long ago, without telling Dad,`
` I went with Mom to see Onii‐chan, and we went to play at an amusement park.`
` ......This is a prize from the crane game there."`
`I know it's something cheap, I realize that it doesn't match my style, and I get that it's too childish.`
`......But this hair accessory is the only thing that makes me feel as though Battler onii‐chan is by my side.`
`The inside of the glass case...`
`had been filled with plastic capsules packed with fun‐looking things.`
`It seemed that each of those capsules had some kind of cute little object inside.`
`The game was to grab those with the crane, ......but I was young, and it was too hard for me.`
`No matter how many times I tried, I didn't even get close.`
`Mom told me that whatever was inside was probably cheap anyway, and we didn't even know what it was,`
` so there was no point in getting all upset over it.`
`But whether it was something cheap or not wasn't the issue.`
` ......The process of grabbing happiness with my own hands...`
`felt very important and sacred to me.`
`So I wanted that capsule with its unknown cheap little object more than anything.`
`Then, Battler onii‐chan came over after finishing with a game where you shoot soldiers with a gun,`
` ......and had a go in my place.`
`...The happiness that was beyond my reach, Onii‐chan stretched out for with his longer arms, and he grasped it for me.`
`......Onii‐chan really was coordinated.`
`{n}Apparently he often played at the arcade with his friends.`
`After only one or two attempts with the crane, he grasped that thing on the other side of the glass that I hadn't even been able to touch,`
` .........and dumped it into the exit chute.`
`When Onii‐chan tossed me that capsule,`
` I remember feeling like I could count on him for {i:anything}.`
`For the next several days, I felt like the capsule was too precious to open up.`
`Then, one day, I finally opened it.`
`......And when I did, what revealed itself from inside was this pink‐bead hair accessory.`
`Since that day...`
`this has been a symbol of Onii‐chan.`
`My young mind thought that getting that four‐person family together, with Battler onii‐chan included,`
` was a precondition for a happy family.`
`So I wanted Onii‐chan and Dad to make up quickly.`
`......In my own way, I had made this hair accessory a charm to bring my whole family together.`
` That's why I always used to wear it.`
`Because I wanted to feel my reliable, funny, and wonderful onii‐chan by my side all the time,`
` and give him a place in our house.`
`"But......my memories of Onii‐chan...are so distant.`
` ......I can't do it as easily as Maria onee‐chan created Sakutarou from a lion stuffed animal."`
`"......One day, I will learn the high‐level magic to revive the souls of the dead.`
` And the only key, the only vessel, that can make that successful...is this."`
`"...........................`
` ......I see.`
` I did feel an incredible magical power from that hair accessory, and that explains it."`
`"Magical power...?`
` Magical power resides in this thing of Onii‐chan's...?"`
`"Maybe I should say that you are imbuing it with that power.`
` ......Your strong desire to call your brother to you is giving you magical power."`
`"......Resurrection certainly is a high‐level magic,`
` but there can be no mistake that you are steadily and unconsciously climbing the stairs towards that magic."`
`"............I'm glad.`
` It's nice to hear someone other than myself acknowledge that."`
`Your own effort isn't something that you can observe by yourself.`
`In that sense,`
` ......even though these words came from a dangerous demon girl who governs one of the seven deadly sins,`
` ......they made me very happy.`
`"Well, I can't guarantee that you will attain the magic of resurrection before your life is over.`
` ......However, your power as a witch will be proportional to the height of the mountain you dare to climb."`
`"If you don't lose heart, I'm sure that one day you'll be able to rival even our former master,`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, as a Great Witch."`
`"......I wonder if I can.`
` Become a Great Witch and revive Onii‐chan,`
` ......no, my family."`
`"The Witch of Resurrection, Lady {f:5:Ange}...!"`
`"Kyaah, how wonderful!`
` A Witch of Resurrection is a very rare kind of witch.`
` Having a witch like that as my master would make me pretty proud.`
` Actually, I'd love for that to happen.`
` Because furniture's worth is also proportional to the rank of its master!"`
`"Please zip right on by {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama and become a Great Witch like the world has never seen!`
` On behalf of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, I support you from the bottom of my heart! Kyaha!"`
`...............I'd thought that if a magical friend were to appear for me too, I'd like a cute kid like Sakutarou.`
`But even this fifth sister of the frightening Seven Sisters who govern the seven deadly sins was enough to calm my heart this much all by herself.`
`......Maria onee‐chan probably knew this long ago.`
` That's why she recommended the world of witches to me over and over and over again.`
`And I kept on stubbornly rejecting it......`
`I should have given in and started my training as a witch sooner.`
`A year as a child compares with ten in old age...was it...?`
`At this point, I find my past self deplorable for wasting precious time doing nothing but complaining.`
`Long after I turned off the lights and slipped into bed, Mammon continued to talk to me beside my pillow.`
`......I promise.`
` One day, for sure, I'll develop a magical power that can summon the Seven Sisters.`
` And I'll let them have a lively and fun time.`
`The seven of them make a single whole.`
` ......None can be left out.`
`Family must be together.`
`{n}I must......bring them together.........`
`"...................................."`
`My awareness began to return slowly.`
`I hadn't been able to stand watching Aunt Rosa and Maria onee‐chan's relationship,`
` ......and had run away from Beato and Onii‐chan's game, hadn't I...`
`......I've got to go back.`
`I've got to go back, support Onii‐chan, and quickly bring him back from this world and its crazy witch games.`
`Because as long as I'm here, ......I'm not permitted to call myself Ange.`
`......Suddenly, I felt someone's presence.`
`When I turned around, .........there stood Mammon.`
`"Gretel‐sama.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama says that if you do not return soon, it will become a hindrance to the progression of the game.`
` I beg that you return swiftly."`
`"............Thanks.`
` ...I'll go back now."`
`"Isn't it great?"`
`"What is...?"`
`"You being able to meet Battler onii‐chan."`
`"..................Sarcasm?"`
`"If it sounds that way to you, you can take it that way if you want?"`
`".........I'm sorry.`
` I should accept it literally.`
` ...Yes, it is.`
` Even in this screwed‐up world, being able to see Onii‐chan makes me happy from the bottom of my heart."`
`"And you'll win against {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, for your onii‐chan's sake...?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......Can't have him playing around in a world like this forever.`
` ......It's about time for him to return home.`
` That's why I came to call him."`
`"...............Please do the best you can.`
` Although I can't support you, seeing as my current master is {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"I know.`
` Until October 5th, 1986, ...you are {f:5:Beatrice}'s furniture.`
` And eventually, you become my friend."`
`"And eventually, you throw that friend away.`
` After all, ......ng, .........ghkh..."`
`Mammon moaned as if she had bit her tongue, staggering as she clutched her chest.`
` Apparently, the rule applies to people other than me as well.`
`"Are you alright?`
` That's pretty...painful."`
`".....................`
` ......I do apologize.`
` G‐...Gretel‐sama."`
`"That's alright.`
` Thanks."`
`".........?"`
`"I'm happy.`
` That I was able to meet Onii‐chan.`
` That's the answer to your original question.`
` .........Well, let's go back.`
` If I grumble too much, you'll get in trouble with your current master."`
`"Yes.`
` Thank you for understanding.`
` Well then, th"`
`"..................Mammon?`
` ............Huh?"`
`I'm sure Mammon had been about to say "Well then, this way..."`
`But......she stopped dead, as though the film had been torn off.`
`It looked like she had suddenly frozen.`
`...Then I noticed.`
` She wasn't the only thing that had frozen.`
`{n}......Even the air and floating bits of dust had frozen in place.`
`A world where it seemed like even time itself had frozen.`
`......Yes.`
` It resembled what would usually happen just before {f:5:Bernkastel} appeared.`
`But the atmosphere was different somehow.`
` Then I understood.`
`.........It wasn't {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`{n}...It was the other witch.`
`"How are you doing, Ange...?"`
`"...............{f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` ......The rule doesn't apply to you, I see."`
`"Duh?`
` Rules exist to bind others.`
` What kind of idiot would bind themselves with them?"`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} is a witch who supports me, ......but this girl is different.`
`This witch supports {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}...In other words, she's on the side of the enemy.`
`But there's some kind of difference between her and {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`There's something elusive about {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s existence, and {f:5:Bernkastel}'s as well.`
` ......How should I put it... Maybe like they're beings from a higher dimension...`
`In any event, I'm still unsure about how to deal with her.`
`......The only thing that I'm certain about is that she is my enemy.`
` ...No, just knowing that might be enough...`
`"So, ......do you have some business with me?"`
`"Kinda.`
` I was listening in on your conversation and it started to get a bit interesting.`
` I thought I'd let you hear something good."`
`"You're supposed to be my enemy.`
` I can't think of any reason for you to tell me something that would benefit me.`
` ......So the moment I start listening to you, I lose.`
` Goodbye, <see you next time>."`
`"Don't get the wrong idea.`
` My opponent is Bern, not you.`
` ......So it is possible for there to be a topic that benefits both you and me."`
`".....................Sorry,`
` but I don't feel like listening."`
`......That said,`
` I probably won't be released from this frozen time until {f:5:Lambdadelta} is happy.`
`......That itself might be proof that she's a higher‐dimensional being than me.`
`{n}I haven't been given the option of not listening to her.`
`About the only thing I can do is strengthen my mental guard, and try not to be shaken by anything she says.`
`She'll probably either try to make me believe something disadvantageous to me,`
` or threaten me...`
`"*giggle*giggle*.`
` Seriously, you don't need to get so defensive.`
` I just came to fix your misunderstanding.`
` ......Well, actually, no.`
` I came thinking I'd tell you about the lie {f:5:Bernkastel} told you."`
`".........{f:5:Bernkastel}.........lied?"`
`"I'll bet Bern made it sound like, if you defeated Beato, your big brother would come back?"`
`"..................`
` Who knows.`
` ...I don't have any intention of talking about it with you."`
`My brother coming home...`
`{n}I hadn't been promised anything that dream‐like.`
`It was a promise with considerably low prospects, where I could end up with maybe one person and only if I was lucky.`
`But that's enough for me.`
`......Since I was promised an eternity of isolation,`
` this faint but still non‐zero chance was like a blindingly bright beacon to me.`
`"In a way, that promise of Bern's wasn't a lie.`
` ......If that's what Bern promised, then I'm sure that if you defeat Beato, Battler and your parents will be released and come back to you."`
`"Then there's no problem, is there."`
`"............Seriously?`
` .........That girl, you'd never think she was that cruel, you know?`
` {i:To deceive you on purpose}."`
`".........How are you saying I was deceived?"`
`Shoot...`
`I've let her take the initiative.`
`...But I won't be released until I lend an ear to her story.`
` ...So it's something I'll have to hear anyway...`
`Even though I realized that I could be on the verge of falling into a trap, I urged her onwards.`
`"What year is it now?"`
`"......You're talking about the world of the game board?`
` ...In that case, it's October 4th, 1986."`
`"That's right.`
` So, if you win against Beato, then on October 6th, when the typhoon has passed, the people who were trapped on the island will return.`
` ......On October 6th, 1986, that is."`
`"...............So what?"`
`"How was your October 6th, 1986?`
` ............You were at a relative's house, weren't you?"`
`......I had been at the house of the only Sumadera my mother trusted—Grandpa.`
`.........We got a call.`
`While I was playing with building blocks in the tatami room, we got that call...`
`After watching to see that I had remembered,`
` ......{f:5:Lambdadelta} smiled unpleasantly,`
` ......and spoke.`
`"WELLLL?`
` ON YOUR OCTOBER 6TH, 1986, DID BATTLER ONII‐CHAN COME HOOOME?"`
`"...................................."`
`Even though I didn't understand what I was being told, I noticed an unpleasant sweat seeping out all over my face...`
`......Aaah, I don't understand.`
` I DON'T UNDERSTAND.`
`{n}......What is this witch......saying.........?`
`"Okay, so, it's like...`
` If you defeat Beato, Battler {i:will} certainly be released.`
` And yep, he'll probably return home.`
` To his home in 1986."`
`"I mean, he would, right?`
` Battler is imprisoned in the two days of the 4th to the 5th of October, 1986.`
` Obviously he'd return to the next day if he was released, right?"`
`"......And who are you?`
` A person from 1998.`
` You're Ushiromiya Ange of the year 1998 in which {i:Battler did not return}.`
` Get it?"`
`"............What...are you talking about?`
` .........If my family came back home on October 6th, ...that would be wonderful, wouldn't it?`
` I would come home from Grandpa's house right away.`
` And then we'd meet.`
` ......And everyone would live happily ever after..."`
`"Yes.`
` Ushiromiya Ange probably would be able to reunite with her family.`
` ......{i:The six‐year‐old Ushiromiya Ange from 1986} would, right......?"`
`".........Who am I?"`
`"Ushiromiya Ange.`
` An eighteen‐year‐old one."`
`".........No, that's not it.`
` You aren't Ushiromiya Ange.`
` ......You're a witch's piece with that name.`
` Strictly speaking, a completely different person, with the name {f:5:Ange Beatrice}.`
` ......Get it?"`
`I'm...starting to think I don't......`
`.........Huh?`
` ......Huh?`
` ......Who...`
`......am I?`
` ............Huh?`
`"......And thaaat's why I think Bern's cruel.`
` No, I think she's a meanie.`
` It's not like she hasn't had that experience herself."`
`".........Am I............`
`......somehow...`
`......being tricked.........?"`
`"Ah, but please don't blame Bern, okay?`
` After all, depending on how you look at it, she isn't lying."`
`"......If you defeat Beato, your family will be returned.`
` Returned to Ushiromiya Ange.`
` ......But she probably didn't say that this Ushiromiya Ange would be you, right...?"`
`Was it like that... Was it like that......?`
`{n}What did {f:5:Bernkastel} say to me, again......?`
`Your assistance is needed.`
` ......Your family needs it.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} had started by saying that.`
`Then I had responded.`
`{n}If I save them, does that mean my family will come back?`
`{n}......And how had {f:5:Bernkastel} answered that, again......?`
`Umm, umm......`
`{m:-5:—}—I cannot promise that.`
`Uh, umm......!`
`{n}That kid did promise me.`
`{n}In exchange for accepting this fight...!`
`{n}Yes, this is what she said!`
`{m:-5:—}—In exchange, I will search for the fragment with the ideal world that you wish for,`
` the world where your family comes home.`
`............Yes, that's right.`
` ......She only said she'd search for it.`
`{n}She didn't say she'd find it.`
` ......But I've been...prepared for that from the beginning.`
`Even so, ......she did promise that as long as I didn't give up, there was a faint chance of it happening......`
`And, ......in the end, she said this.`
`{m:-5:—}—I'm giving you a chance for revenge.`
` ...In exchange, I promise to find and bring you the happiest resolution that it is possible for you to receive.`
`".....................`
` ......I've known it was a tough bet from the very beginning.`
` ......After all, I have no family in my 1998."`
`"If I could have a small chance of shaking that certain zero,`
` ......that alone would make it worth it for me.`
` I was warned beforehand that even if I succeeded in my revenge, it might be a wasted effort.`
` ......So, .........umm............"`
`"Yes, there's no lie in that part.`
` Beato's game board is perfect.`
` No matter what moves you make,`
` the chances of Beato losing are so slim that it's doubtful you could even dream of it happening once in your life."`
`"In other words, that chance of winning is so absolutely virtually zero that it could be regarded as infinitely close to zero.`
` So it's not really Bern's fault that she had to say it in such an evasive manner."`
`"......But I can say for sure that she was tricking you when she let you get your hopes up.`
` 'Cause, I mean, even if you managed to overcome the astronomical odds and win,`
` the person your family would return to is not you."`
`"It's the six‐year‐old Ange that exists in this 1986—the rightful Ushiromiya Ange.`
` Not {i:you}."`
`"......Even so, Bern will still probably go around billions of fragments, searching for the most acceptable world for you.`
` And didn't she tell you?`
` That she planned on bringing it to you as a present, but wasn't able to find it?"`
`"............She did......"`
`"Hehheheheheh, *giggle*giggle*giggle*...!!`
` Finally starting to realize...?`
` There's no reward waiting for you in this battle."`
`"No, to the contrary, if you defeat Beato, her game board will disappear.`
` Then {i:you, as a piece, will disappear as well}."`
`".........There's no goal you'll be capable of appreciating—such a thing is {i:utterly}...`
`.........no.`
` I'll proclaim it upon my name.`
` Upon the name of the Witch of Certainty, the Witch of the Absolute, {f:5:Lambdadelta}!`
` I proclaim, {i:with absolute certainty}, that such a thing does not exist...!"`
`".....................No........."`
`"That's Bern's lie.`
` ......Or should I call it speaking in riddles?`
` She made you misunderstand and think that there was some salvation for you.`
` I came to clear that up."`
`"...............So,`
` ......no matter how I fight,`
` no matter what victory I secure,`
` ......my family won't come back to me.........?"`
`"No, they won't!`
` For {i:certain}!`
` Oh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!!`
` The Witch of Certainty is telling you it's for certain!"`
`"Do you know how incredible that is?`
` There have been several ancient kings who dedicated historical buildings to me because they wanted me to give them certainty!`
` And I'm generously giving it to you as a present."`
`"Isn't this so lovely, cute and marvelous?`
` Ohhh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!!`
` Buuut!`
` I do have one nice little proposal for you."`
`.........Not good.`
`{n}...I'm getting completely swept up......`
`I knew I shouldn't have listened, ......and now the witch {f:5:Lambdadelta} is starting to suck me in......!`
`"My opponent is Bern, not you.`
` I said just now that it's possible for there to be a subject that benefits us both.`
` I've been saying since the beginning that that's what I want to talk about.`
` So listen to me.`
` You have no choice but to...!"`
`"..................Alright, I'll listen...`
` I'm listening......`
` ......I'm listening, okay, are you happy now?!!"`
`I finally lost control over my emotions and exploded from the inside.`
`I don't have a clue anymore.`
`{n}......I believed that I was Ange.`
`But at some point, I stopped being Ange.`
`That's right, I'm {f:5:Ange}.`
` Not Ange...!`
`Who am I?`
` I'm not my parents' daughter, nor my brother's little sister.`
` .........I'm just a piece......in a witch's game...!`
`"There's no need to be so pessimistic.`
` ......I mean, think about it, okay?`
` Right now, you're together with Battler onii‐chan."`
`"While it's true that you can't tell him your name,`
` you're at least positioned as his ally in a game of fighting against witches,`
` ......and you're able to be with him for all eternity.`
` ......Get iiiiiit......??"`
`.........Frustratingly,`
` .........I do...`
`In other words, .........as long as Onii‐chan keeps getting a draw in this game, it will be repeated forever.`
`Continuing to draw means the game will continue for eternity,`
` and it means that I, a game piece, can remain with Onii‐chan.`
`......But if Onii‐chan wins, or else loses, and the curtain closes on the game...`
`"You, a piece, will disappear."`
`".............................."`
`"What is the happiness of a game piece?`
` ......Nothing more than being played with in the game.`
` It doesn't come when the game's shut in the closet, gathering dust, right?"`
`......In the past, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory said it as well.`
` Furniture's happiness is being used, not being stored away.`
`That's right.`
` ......I am now...`
`.........the witch's...`
`......furniture.`
`"Lemme change the subject a bit, 'kay?`
` ......Actually, I {i:want} this game to continue as a draw for all eternity.`
` An unending game is an eternal cage.`
` ......An absolute locked room, which will never open for all time, and which will finally make Bern surrender."`
`"......The thing is, Beato does want to win, in a way.`
` By making Battler surrender.`
` But that's actually a problem for me."`
`"I mean, if the game ends, the locked room will fall apart.`
` ......So I'm going easy on Battler to a certain degree, to make sure that he doesn't surrender."`
`"Don't worry, okay?`
` When Battler starts surrendering, I'm even supporting him and stuff."`
`".........The only thing is,`
` I get the feeling Beato is faintly starting to realize that.`
` ......I think she's starting to realize that her victory in this game might not come for all eternity."`
`"But we're okay there, 'cause, she's the Endless Witch.`
` Beato's stupid, so she optimistically thinks that even so, she'll surely win eventually,`
` and just has to repeat this game on and on endlessly until that happens."`
`"Blonde‐haired girls are almost always stupid, *giggle*giggle*!"`
`".........Then, in this game of witches,`
` .........there's no such thing...`
`as victory or loss......"`
`"I won't let her win.`
` And I won't let her lose.`
` With certainty!"`
`"......Bern realizes that.`
` So she found you to be the most powerful piece for breaking that deadlock, and threw you in.`
` To bring this game to an end, you see?"`
`".........To bring this game...to an end......"`
`"When it ends, what role do the pieces have?`
` .........I'll state it clearly.`
` Your existence is a contradiction.`
` ......Your reason for existing is to bury yourself in the darkness and despair...!"`
`My goal is to defeat Beato and release my captive family.`
`......And yet, even if I succeed, I won't be rewarded.`
`"You cannot lose.`
` And you won't be rewarded if you win.`
` ......So I've brought you a third choice.`
` And that choice will allow our interests to align."`
`............Continuing the draw...forever.........`
`"Yes.`
` ......As long as they continue to draw for all eternity, this world will not collapse."`
`"......What is this world?`
` .........It is the world of the game with the witch.`
` A world where Beato and Battler fight forever."`
`"......And at the same time,`
` it is a world where you can be with Battler forevermore......!!"`
`"..................uu...`
`.........uu`
`......ah`
`............"`
`My brain turned to mush.`
`I could feel the chaos pouring from my eyes as a hot liquid...`
`{n}The heat of it......felt like it was going to burn my face...`
`"Think about it......`
` {f:5:Ange Beatriceeeee}...`
` Since {f:5:Bernkastel}'s goal is to end the game and end the world where you and Battler can interact, why should you be on her side...?"`
`"......That girl was tricking you, you know?`
` She made it look like you might be saved if you became her piece.`
` But I won't deceive you there!"`
`"......So I'll say it, {f:5:Ange}.`
` Become my chess piece.`
` Unlike Bern, I won't offer you false rewards that you'll absolutely never receive."`
`"As long as you become my piece, and help me so that this game is {i:certain} never to end,`
` I'll grant you a {i:certain} promise, upon my name, that this world will {i:certainly} continue!"`
`"That's not all.`
` I'll add on a bonus, too.`
` The rule that binds you.`
` .........I'll clear it away for you.`
` Well, of course, that's only after you've sworn to become my piece, alright?"`
`My throat......made a heavy, loud gulping sound......`
`Aah, I shouldn't have listened......`
` If I hadn't listened, I could have remained an innocent little sister, praying for my brother's victory.`
`......But I might be different now.`
`...I might have degraded into a witch's furniture,`
` .........satisfied merely to be by Onii‐chan's side......`
`"......I'm not telling you to betray your brother, alright?`
` If it looks like Battler's gonna lose, you can save him with all you've got.`
` ......On the other hand, when Battler closes in on Beato too much, I just want you to hold back a little,`
` ......and that's all I'm asking, okay?"`
`"Don't worry, there's no need to go so far that you're actually betraying Battler.`
` ......Battler can't win against Beato alone.`
` That's why Bern threw you in, right?`
` ......As long as you don't lend a hand, Battler will be unable to win against Beato for all eternity."`
`"See?`
` See how eeeeasy it is?`
` ......*giggle*giggle*, hohhohohoho, ahhah{0}haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!`
` Kah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah, kyaaa‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"`
`"Heyyyy!!`
` That's miiine!`
` Give—it—back!!"`
`"Nonono, I'm gonna eat i~t!`
` Asmo, Asmo, pass!"`
`"Kyaahahahaha!`
` Levia onee‐sama, over here, over here~!"`
`I wonder where they swiped it from.`
`{n}They were fighting over a donut or something, playing around really loudly.`
`"HEY!!!!!`
` Ange‐sama is reading, can't you be the slightest bit quiet?!"`
`"And yet you're the loudest one, Satan, silence yourself!!`
` You cretinous sister!"`
`"Y‐you're louder than me, Lucifer onee‐sama!!`
` I‐is there something you want to say to me?!"`
`By now, I was used to the fights between the eldest and the third‐eldest sister.`
` It's a bit funny how they're both a little hesitant even though they're so quick to anger.`
`They might be surprisingly similar.`
`"Heh heh.`
` You ordered us to be noisy, but this is surely too much.`
` Should I make them lower the volume a little?"`
`"............You can all mess around all you want.`
` It's a hundred times more pleasant than the shrill laughter in the classroom."`
`"Ange‐samaa, hurry up, next paaage!`
` You read really slooww!"`
`"You like to read, Mammon?`
` You look like you'd be the most averse to such ordinary things."`
`"Mammon's domain is greed.`
` ......That also includes a thirst for knowledge.`
` But she tends to want to keep that knowledge all for herself, so when someone gives her a book, she'll sometimes burn it after reading it so that no one else can—please watch out for that."`
`"I like knowing things that no one else knows.`
` I like being able to do things that no one else can do.`
` So I like studying and practicing.`
` Because I want to keep wisdom that no one else knows about all to myself."`
`As Mammon said that, her eyes sparkling,`
` she stared transfixed at the open page, reading through it again.`
`You could see the greed that made her even more intent than me on devouring that page.`
`As you can see, my magical power was now much stronger compared to the first day I summoned them.`
`I was now at the point where I could summon all of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory at once and still calmly read a book like this.`
`This place, although I couldn't recall {i:where} it was, was a quiet and calm street‐side bench.`
`The reason that I couldn't remember the location of this place was that at the time I visited it, I was very young.`
`......Still, I remembered the day we'd walked here, and how much fun it was.`
`Mom, Dad, ...and even Onii‐chan had been there—`
`it was a memory of a very rare and very happy day when all the family had actually been together...`
`The people walking by every once in a while weren't noticing me.`
`{n}They were just pleasantly ignoring me and passing by as normal.`
`I wasn't even the slightest bit embarrassed by the Seven Sisters' shameless outfits,`
` because it wasn't like they were actually being seen by anyone.`
`In fact, I'd gotten pretty used to them.`
` Just so long as they didn't make {i:me} wear one.`
`I was sitting on a stylish bench, memorizing a timeline for world history.`
`......In an academy system where everything is based on collective responsibility, there's no tolerance for dunces.`
`It seemed that I was lowering the average grade for the class considerably.`
`According to those extremely intellectual girls,`
` if I alone improved my grade, the average would rise drastically.`
`......They had been kind enough to show me with a graph drawn with colorful pens on a B4 sheet of drawing paper.`
`...Just thinking of the effort it must have taken to draw that was nauseating.`
`But I'd already spat out all of those complaints.`
` ......I'd already used those girls to vent all my furious anger and sadness.`
`The Seven Sisters...`
`were sometimes outraged,`
` sometimes compassionate,`
` and sometimes shared in my sorrows.`
`......I was truly happy to have friends with whom I could share those emotions.`
`It's said that they were originally furniture that existed to carry out {f:5:Beatrice}'s cruel sacrificial ritual.`
`......If that sickening occult message bottle was to be believed,`
` ...it seemed that several among them even attacked my family.`
`But I didn't believe that, and it would be pointless to question them about it.`
`They're furniture, so all they do is respond to their master's requests.`
`Even if they really had attacked my family, I couldn't hate them.`
`......The one I really hated...`
`...was the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}.........Or else the one at the very center of Rokkenjimagate,`
` Aunt Eva.`
`"......Ange‐sama, hurry up, next page."`
`"Oh, sorry.`
` .........I'm tired.`
` Mind if I take a break?"`
`"Kyahaha!`
` Ange‐sama says she's having a break!"`
`"Let's play, let's play!`
` Ange‐sama, let's plaaaay!!"`
`When they noticed that I had interrupted my studying, the most energetic youngest sisters gathered around me.`
`That wasn't all.`
`Even Maria onee‐chan and Sakutaro showed themselves.`
`They had probably been very close by, but they must have hid themselves so that they didn't interrupt my studying.`
`‘Uryuu!`
` Ange~!`
` How's studying? How's studying?’`
`"Kyaaah!!`
` Sakutaroo!!`
` How are yooooouu?!"`
`"Wait a second!`
` Let me fluffle him tooooooooooo!!"`
`"You snooze you lose, aren't we always telling you?!`
` Kyaa, so cute, so cute!"`
`‘Ukyuuu, you're crushing meee!`
` Uryuuu!’`
`"Your luck ran out when you showed up when all of the Seven Sisters were gathered.`
` Now accept your fate and be fluffled."`
`"Come on!`
` Do you always have to treat him like this?!`
` I apologize on behalf of my stupid sisters...!"`
`"Ahahahahaha.`
` Sakutaro's happy to meet all of you too.`
` ......Well, Ange?`
` How's your studying?"`
`"Thanks.`
` Well, not bad."`
`"They were nice enough to pass me a printout of the test from another class who took it earlier.`
` Their beautiful sense of solidarity is enough to bring tears to my eyes.`
` ......Well, at least I'll do a little better now for putting the timeline into my head."`
`‘Uryu.`
` You sure are good at studying, Ange.`
` You'll be able to get a lot of points, uryu~~.’`
`"Good work.`
` I was completely useless at studying, so I'm jealous of you for being able to get a good score when you study hard."`
`"You're joking.`
` English, Latin, knowledge of the occult—`
`you're much more amazing for being able to learn all of that by heart."`
`"I can remember anything when studying magic, but can't remember anything boring I have to study.`
` So it doesn't help at all for tests."`
`"Well, I'm sure your occult knowledge would have been a bit like that, but your English and such must have translated into good grades, right?"`
`"In the first year of elementary school, on a Japanese language test,`
` there was a question where I was given a picture of a gun and four squares, and it said to write its name in the four squares.`
` Wrote "rifle"—{ruby:ra‐i‐fu‐ru:{p:0:ライフル}}—and got it marked wrong."`
`"Why?`
` It fits."`
`"It was supposed to be {ruby:te‐p‐po‐u:{p:0:てっぽう}}, the Japanese word for gun.`
` Got told that it was wrong 'cause you don't learn katakana in first grade."`
`"......I didn't really get it,`
` so from that day on, on tests, I wrote everything in hiragana.`
` But got in trouble with Mama for some reason.`
` Got in trouble with the teachers too."`
`".....................`
` ...You probably picked the wrong country to be born in, Onee‐chan."`
`"Then I'd have liked to have been born in a country of witches and go to a school of witchcraft.`
` Uu."`
`‘And then you might have had a whole lot of even more wonderful magic friends!`
` Uryuu!’`
`"Uu{p:0:♪}`
` But it's not like I mind it now.`
` After all, I can use a lot of magic, and I have a lot of magic friends, too.`
` All I need is Sakutaro."`
`‘I'm not the only one!`
` There's also Sakusuke and Sakukichi, the animal band, Shimoda‐kun the seal, Sanae‐san the rabbit, Piguo‐kun the pig, and plenty more!’`
`......Incredible.`
` Onee‐chan's friends just keep increasing in number.`
`Every time I ask, the list of her friends' names grows longer.`
`{n}But there's no doubt that Sakutaro is her best friend.`
`...I'm a little jealous of her for having such a close friend.`
`"......How are they?`
` The Seven Sisters.`
` Are you getting along with them?"`
`"Those sisters are really energetic.`
` ......They sometimes say worrying stuff, but they aren't bad.`
` ...What I really wanted was to get a cute kid like Sakutaro, but now, I think being with these girls is more than enough."`
`"*giggle*.`
` If you learned my Magic of Origins more, I'm sure you'd be able to create just the kind of friend you'd like, Ange.`
` As it is, creation is still a little too hard for you."`
`"There's a difference between creation and summoning.`
` ......And...resurrection is different still."`
`"...............`
` So your greatest wish really is to revive your family...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ............I have a vessel for it.`
` This."`
`"Yes.`
` ...I'm sure that hair accessory will become the key to summoning Battler someday.`
` ......The rest is up to your training, Ange."`
`"Although not knowing how long that's going to take makes me cry."`
`‘Uryu...`
` Stay strong, even if it's tough...`
` If you don't give up, it will definitely definitely happen someday...’`
`"I'm sure I'd feel a lot more at ease if someone would just give me some proof of that."`
`‘Uryu!`
` Then I'll guarantee it!`
` No doubt about it, someday, you'll be able to make your wish come true!’`
`"......Thanks.`
` I'm happy even for consolation."`
`‘It's not consolation...uryuu.’`
`"Stop it, Ange.`
` That kind of emotion will become the anti‐magic toxin.`
` The feeling that your dreams will definitely come true is the best seed that buds into magic power."`
`"............`
` ......You're right, sorry, Master."`
`"You need to be a bit greedier, Ange‐sama.`
` Go however far for the thing that you desire!`
` Never give up until you get it! That's the willpower you're lacking!"`
`‘Uryuu!`
` That isn't true, Ange is doing her best...!’`
`"Thanks, Sakutaro, Mammon.`
` Crying about it won't help anything.`
` There's nothing I can do except hang in there.`
` I'll try hard.`
` Grit my teeth.`
` And I'll definitely make my dreams come true.`
` For certain."`
`‘Uryu!`
` You're awesome, Ange, do your best!`
` Mammon and I will support youuu!’`
`"Yes, we will.`
` The greedier our master is, the more our worth will increase."`
`"More importantly, Ange‐samaa!`
` We have ten whole people here, sooo..."`
`"We were thinking, maybe we could all play {c:86EF9C:shiritori} together or something!"`
`"Penalty if you lose!`
` Let me nibble your ea~rs!"`
`"Come {i:on}, is there anything inside your head other than food?!"`
`"Please forgive my cretinous sisters' imbecilic proposals...`
` Is it really alright for you not to return to your studying about now?"`
`"No, no, nooooooo!!`
` I waited so long for you to finish studying, you gotta play with us, you gottaaaa!"`
`"I don't think it's a bad idea.`
` I would suggest that playing every once in a while is a good way of exercising the mind."`
`"............Your domain was sloth, right, Belphe?`
` What you're saying sounds reasonable, but you're actually being sneaky, aren't you?"`
`"Heh.`
` My apologies.`
` ......You are a diligent one, Ange‐sama."`
`"If it's okay with you, Ange, I'd like to play with everyone, too.`
` All noisy together.`
` It'll definitely be fun."`
`‘Uryuu!`
` Ange, Ange, let's play, let's play!`
` Let's all do shiritori!’`
`"In that case, let's start from Sakutaro's "uryu".`
` .........What does the next word have to start with in this case?`
` "Ryu"?`
` "Yu"?"`
`"If it's "uryu"?`
` ...............I wonder.`
` Maybe it really would be "ryu"?"`
`"......It's rare for a word that ends weirdly like that to come up."`
`"Okay, I'm first then!!`
` I'll start from "ryu"!`
` A {ruby:ryuuzu:"watch ste~m"}!"`
`"I wanted to be the one to speak first!`
` {ruby:ryuuto:"Lute"} would have been so much more wonderful!"`
`"‘Zu’?`
` Feels like we keep getting tough ones.`
` ...Wait a sec, what order are we going in?`
` Who's next?"`
`‘Uryu.`
` I don't think it matters who.`
` Whoever thinks of something first.’`
`"Huh, that sounds fun.`
` The person who can say the most wins?`
` It's fast‐talking shiritori!"`
`"OK, I'll go, then!`
` "Zucchini"!`
` {ruby:ninniku itame:"Garlic stir‐fry"}!`
` "Mekabu and pasta"~!`
` All of them delicious!`
` Kyaha, I said three!"`
`"Belzie takes three points.`
` ......Can you use conjunctions?"`
`"If you could use "and" then anything would work!!`
` That last one doesn't count!`
` Minus one point!!`
` Start over at "me"."`
`"Okay, my turn.`
` {ruby:merenge:"Meringue"~!"}`
`‘‘Ge’??`
` ...U...u...`
`...uryuu!’`
`"{ruby:gesuidou:‘Drainage system’},`
` {ruby:umetatechi:"reclaimed land"},`
` {ruby:chikashitsu:"basement"}.`
` Something like that?"`
`"Onee‐sama, those are all pretty unrefined words, *giggle*!"`
`"S‐so what, why don't you try following up with something refined, then!!`
` Anyway, that's three points for me.`
` The next one's "tsu", alright, "tsu"!"`
`"Never played such a weird shiritori before.`
` Uu‐uu!`
` Fun!"`
`‘Uryuu!`
` I don't get it at all, but it's fun.`
` Uryuu!’`
`I'd played normal shiritori before, but this kind of weird shiritori was a new experience for me.`
`The Seven Sisters, who would be lively enough just on their own; Maria onee‐chan; Sakutaro; and me.`
`I was now surrounded by friends that were just so fun.`
`......The courage to accept a world of magic, a world of witches...`
`...That alone wouldn't change the fact that I was locked up in an academy,`
` without a single friend in my class.`
`But I was having such a fun and merry time regardless.`
`.........I'll become a witch like Maria onee‐chan.`
`And someday, I'll add my family to this happy circle.`
`Mom, Dad.`
` And Onii‐chan.`
`......If possible, George onii‐chan and Jessica onee‐chan, too.`
` And my other relatives.`
`I'll call everyone, everyone here, without a single person missing, ...and we'll all be gathered together.`
`"......That is my...dream.`
` ......Yes,`
` and until I make it come true, I'm definitely not going to lose heart."`
`"I'm sure you'll become a Great Witch, Ange‐sama.`
` As long as you believe that.`
` We Seven Stakes of Purgatory will always serve by your side until that day comes."`
`"You'll be there...?`
` No matter how long,`
` ......you'll lend me your strength?"`
`"Of course.`
` After all, I'm your friend, right, Ange‐sama?"`
`"........................`
` ......Yes, you are.`
` Let's always stick together and play together.`
` Today, and in the future...forevermore."`
`"Until the day you can make your dream come true."`
`The lively, ten‐person game of shiritori,`
` cut off from time alongside the street, under the forever bright warmth of the sun, continued without end......`
`".........What. The. Hell. {i:Seriously}, Ushiromiya‐saan?"`
`".............................."`
`......In the end,`
` I wasn't able to make a very good grade on my test.`
`I had thought I'd memorized things, in my own way,`
` but if you could manage anything by cramming all night like that, no one would worry about tests.`
`"Normally, when you know the questions beforehand, you'd ace it easily, right? Easily!"`
`"It's true that we didn't go so far as to write the answers into the blanks for you.`
` We thought you'd have the sense to study at least that much."`
`"Oh my God!`
` No frigging way. This is... God almighty...!`
` They're almost all wrong, aren't they?`
` Did you really actually study for this?!"`
`"..................More or less..."`
`"This isn't what you call more or less, Ushiromiya‐san.`
` ......My mind is reeling from how horrible this is."`
`"O Lord.`
` Please forgive her for getting a miserable grade on such an easy test,`
` and plummeting the average score for the entire class...!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*,`
` ahahahahahahaha."`
`......The same test had been given to another class first.`
`{n}They had managed to get hold of that test paper, so the average score for this test was unusually high.`
`Enough to obscure my slight improvement.`
`However, ......there were some things that I couldn't make an excuse for.`
`If I had spent that entire day studying like mad, I might have been able to get a slightly higher score.`
`......But I hadn't gone that far.`
`After all, after that on that day,`
` ......I had spent the time having fun playing shiritori with the Seven Sisters, Sakutaro, and Onee‐chan.`
`As expected, the winner had been Maria onee‐chan.`
`{n}She had been a strong player because of her various bits of random knowledge.`
`Sakutaro had gotten the penalty.`
`He had spent the whole time cheering for everyone else's answers,`
` and had completely forgotten to think of any himself.`
`......Because of that, he got dogpiled by the Seven Sisters and had his ears thoroughly nibbled, didn't he?`
`"Excuse me, are you listening, Ushiromiya‐san?!"`
`"..........................."`
`They were surrounding me, twittering like small birds.`
`{n}Annoying, smelly.`
`On the outside of that circle was Mammon, a weary expression on her face...`
`"This school is as messed up as always.`
` If their own grades are good, shouldn't they be more than happy?"`
`".........It's probably because of that collective responsibility thing.`
` Instead of worrying about their own grades,`
` they're more concerned about how embarrassing it is for the class average to be low."`
`"Or maybe it's because they really really hate the volunteer work they're forced to do as punishment."`
`"So in other words, they aren't studying because they want their grades to be good,`
` but because of collective responsibility and because they hate volunteer work?"`
`"......They're jealous and embarrassed.`
` They don't want to be inferior to anyone, and they don't want to be humiliated.`
` That's the only feeling that drives them to study."`
`"What noisy people. If they want to study, why can't they just do it themselves?"`
`"In the end,`
` without collective responsibility and volunteer work, they'd have no desire to study.`
` ......How foolish it is to study without knowing the meaning of studying."`
`"Wow, these guys are so annoying and stupid!`
` Stop disturbing Ange‐sama's precious lunchtime!"`
`"Waaah, I hate these guyyyys!!`
` Just go awayyyyy!!"`
`"I'm huuungryyyyyy!!`
` Disappear already, waaaah!!"`
`"..................`
` .........I'm sorry, everyone.`
` I wonder why {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s are so despicable."`
`"It's probably because, instead of working hard themselves,`
` forcing you to put the effort in is the easier way for them to greedily boost the class average.`
` ......Humans are all greedy.`
` And they'll burden others with that to make things easier for themselves."`
`"...We'll eventually be reunited with them on the Mountain of Purgatory.`
` When they get to the fifth terrace, they better watch their step..."`
`Mammon controls the fifth terrace of the mountain that reaches to Paradise: Mount Purgatory.`
`......Given that she herself was promising them this, we can probably be sure that after those girls die, their journey to heaven will not be an easy one.`
`...No, in fact, why don't they just go to hell.`
`The class committee had applied to the student council to use a classroom during lunch and after school.`
`The purpose of use was for a class study group.`
` A wonderful little gathering so that they can all collect around me and make me study. I'm overjoyed.`
`Which meant that every day, I would have all of my lunch and three hours of my afternoon stolen away from me.`
`The academy and its student council, with its motto of student self‐government,`
` instantly approved of this pleasant activity that the students were taking up of their own initiative...`
`In other words, I would no be longer able to escape after school by leaving the classroom...`
`After school, the first class study group meeting started right away.`
`Would they open a textbook, then kindly and carefully explain so that even I could understand it?`
` Of course it was nothing like that naive fantasy.`
`After school in the classroom, around a dozen of my classmates crowded around my desk.`
`First, before we started studying...`
`Why were my grades so bad?`
` What was the reason?`
`{n}It was decided that we couldn't start until I could clearly answer those questions, become aware of the problem, and show remorse for my actions.`
`......Of course, there was no way I had an answer to a question like that.`
`They had avoided me like the plague up until now.`
` And they had rejected me and kept me at a distance so as not to include me in their communities.`
`So I had been avoiding their communities myself.`
` There shouldn't have been any conflict between us that way.`
`So even when they formed this community intent on raising the class average,`
` I obviously kept well away from it.`
`Even if I had tried to join in,`
` they would probably have ignored me, just like they had always done in the past.`
`"If you'd just have asked, we'd have taught you as much you wanted.`
` Wouldn't weeeee?!"`
`"""We wouuuuuuuld!!!"""`
`Such enthusiasm.`
` ......I'd had enough of their ex‐post‐facto pretenses of charity.`
`"Ushiromiya‐san, the thing that's bad about you is you're lacking a cooperative attitude.`
` You only think about yourself—it's that selfish way of thinking that's the problem."`
`"Those who gather in Saint Lucia's place of learning shall have a cooperative heart.`
` It is written right there in the student handbook, you know?"`
`"I think if you have a cooperative attitude,`
` that's what gives birth to the desire to study together and contribute to the entire class.`
` I think {i:that's} the most fundamental thing that you're lacking, how about you?!"`
`"Heeey, have you been listening to us?!`
` We've gone to all the trouble of staying after school to have this talk {i:for your sake}, you know?!"`
`.....................`
`The tears of gratitude are pouring down.`
`Of course, they didn't like that.`
`"This way, it almost makes it look like we're bullying you", they scolded me.`
`Fortunately, I'm normally all cried out anyway.`
`{n}If I'm told not to cry, I can hold it back.`
`First, I was to write a letter of remorse and read it out loud.`
`Of course, they meant today.`
`The class president politely applied to the student council and the staff room for an extension on the use of the classroom.`
`......Apparently it was accepted right away.`
`Which meant that, starting now, I would be forced into self‐criticism here for at least a full five hours......`
`{m:-5:―}―I, Ushiromiya Ange, caused trouble for my classmates by getting a low score on my test.`
`"That's not iiiiiit!!"`
`"You getting low grades and causing us trouble isn't the root of the problem, right?!"`
`"It's a cooperative attitude, a cooperative attitude!!"`
`"Come ooon!!`
` Why do we even have to guide you on how to write a letter of remorse?!"`
`Their abusive jeers flew about one after another.`
`I followed their "guidance" and put the eraser to it.`
`{m:-5:―}―I, Ushiromiya Ange, caused trouble for my classmates by not having a cooperative attitude.`
`"Hey, wait a sec, it's pointless if you just write whatever we say!"`
`"Do you even frigging know what "remorse" means?!"`
`"It's pointless if you don't write it in your own words, pointless!"`
`"I've always thought you were a bit strange, Ushiromiya‐san, but you really are an odd one!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`Even following their guidance didn't change the jeers much; in fact, now it felt like they were mocking me more as well...`
`In this way, over the following several hours, without rest, without being allowed to go to the bathroom,`
` of course without being permitted to have dinner, and while being continuously insulted...`
`......I was coerced into writing a document which humiliated myself......`
`And as it passed nine at night, ......I was told to stand up and read it aloud.`
`The contents...`
`...were smeared black with tears and eraser marks.`
`It certainly was my handwriting,`
` ......but it was like a list of soulless letters,`
` whose contents I couldn't even remember.`
`Everything had been copied down according to their guidance.`
`So while I had been the one to write the letters, they weren't my words.`
`I was being coerced into writing it down, and even coerced into reading it aloud.`
`.........I was surprised to find that even after all this time, in addition to ignoring someone and hiding their things,`
` there were still other ways, like this, to bully people......`
`"Come onnn!`
` Hurry up and read it out!!"`
`"Look how many people are staying this late just for you, Ushiromiya‐san.`
` How about a little gratitude?"`
`"Isn't the fact that she doesn't feel gratitude for that indicative of her not having a scrap of cooperative attitude?"`
`"It's alright, Ushiromiya‐san.`
` We'll always be with you from now on.`
` Why not study with us and remake yourself?`
` Okay?"`
`"*giggle*giggle* “Ahahahahaha “Kyahhhya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya!!””"`
`Still surrounded by them, I stood from my seat......and dropped my gaze towards the blackened page.`
`And then......I began to speak those humiliating words,`
` but right away, jeers flew at me saying that they couldn't hear and to speak up.`
`...............I can't read this.`
`I had no idea...`
`that being forced to read a paragraph humiliating me would be so painful.`
`My throat shook.`
` My fingertips shook.`
` ......The paragraph of humiliation written in my own handwriting made my eyes burn with a hot liquid.`
`So my world blurred and twisted.`
`The girls surrounding me all appeared warped.`
`......I saw them warped into exactly the impression I had of them.`
`In other words, ......this was the correct view.`
`Beyond that twisted crowd of people, ......I could see my friends.`
`Compassion could be seen in all of their eyes.`
`".........Ange, .........stay strong..."`
`‘Uryuu.........’`
`Maria onee‐chan and Sakutaro were looking at me with sad eyes.`
`{n}Perhaps because they realized that even cheap words of compassion would hurt me.`
`......They kept alternating between trying to say something, and hanging their heads.`
`"What the hell's wrong with these people...!!"`
`"They're such dirtbags!`
` Really pisses me off!`
` What's so fun about ganging up on Ange‐sama and tormenting her?!"`
`"The resentment of not being able to spit out their jealousy.`
` Anyone would do, just as long as they can spit it out.`
` They're the worst."`
`"Ange‐sama!`
` In this kind of situation, going mad with rage for the sake of your own honor is perfectly acceptable!!`
` Anger is an appropriate emotion and an appropriate reaction!`
` If you don't get mad now, when {i:are} you going to?!!"`
`"Stop it, don't stir Ange‐sama up with cheap anger!!`
` If Ange‐sama could do that, she would have done it already!!"`
`"...............If the situation could improve by you getting angry, then that is what you should do.`
` However, objectively speaking, that would only serve to aggravate the situation further.`
` ......It may be humiliating, but the wisest thing to do now is to withstand it."`
`"Ahha!`
` You really are a sloth, Belphe‐nee!`
` Screw that, I can't stand this!!`
` I can't forgive them!!"`
`‘...E‐everyone, settle down...`
` You're putting a burden on Ange...’`
`"A burden?!`
` What are you talking about? Is this the time or place to be calm?!`
` We furniture are not so cruel as to be able to coolly watch our master being humiliated!!"`
`"Ange‐sama!!`
` You have no obligation to read such a humiliating essay!`
` If you can't let out a cry of rage, then at least throw that insulting message onto the floor!!"`
`"You don't need to trash‐talk them, you don't need to yell so loud that they bend over backwards!`
` Just throw that notebook on the floor with all your might...!!`
` That's all you need to do to show how strong‐willed you are!!"`
`"Don't be so irresponsible!!`
` I told you already!`
` If Ange‐sama could do that, she would have done so long ago!!"`
`"Nothing will be resolved by the eruption of momentary emotions.`
` Why don't you understand that doing that will only worsen the criticism Ange‐sama is receiving?!"`
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!`
` Why is this happening to Ange‐sama when she didn't do anything wrong?!"`
`"Not letting her eat dinner, and making her stay so long after school! I hate iiiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`"And it's not just tonight, it's tomorrow and the day after too!!`
` Give me a break! I can't bear this humiliation!!"`
`"Excuse me!! Are you actually listening to us?!"`
`Someone tugged at my hair.`
`{n}......I was pulled back into miserable reality.`
`...I was no longer even permitted to listen to the Seven Sisters expressing my inner thoughts on my behalf.`
`My hair was lifted upwards, one of my hair ornaments came off, and I heard it bounce and then roll on the ground.`
`......No one picked it up.`
`To the contrary, they casually avoided it as though something filthy had come rolling towards them.`
`I tried to follow it with my eyes, but my hair was tugged upwards again.`
`"Why is it that you're {i:never} listening, even though we're trying to have a real serious talk with you?!"`
`"In one ear and out the other, is it?`
` Or maybe we're talking to a brick wall?!`
` Get a grip, alright?!"`
`"Are you really conscious of the trouble you're causing all of us?`
` You better not be about to say you just wrote that grudgingly because we told you to!"`
`"Until you can really feel remorse by yourself, this seriously isn't gonna end, get it?!`
` It's not just gonna be today.`
` This is seriously gonna keep on going tomorrow and the day after, you got that?!`
` I'm warning you, don't push your luck with us!!"`
`"Like, more to the point, what are you even still alive for?`
` Could you guys go on like this?`
` If it were me, I'd just die!"`
`"Yeah, I could never live this way!`
` Think about it, just by being alive, you'd be getting in other people's way all the time, right?`
` If it were me, I definitely couldn't live on!"`
`"Yeah, yeah, I'd die too.`
` If that's better for the world, I'd die on the spot! Wouldn't yooooou?!!"`
`{a:c:`
`......Then die.}`
`"Ange‐sama......"`
`"Kill them all, immediately!!`
` Lucifer, did you hear me?!"`
`"Huh?! ......Ah..."`
`"You Seven Sisters of Purgatory are incredible furniture that can massacre mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s in a flash, right?!`
` You're always boasting about it to me!!"`
`"Then do it!`
` Kill them all right now!!`
` Right here, right now!!"`
`".........But..............."`
`For some reason, Lucifer's speech faltered.`
`"......Why?`
` What's wrong?!`
` You're certain‐kill furniture that can fly around faster than the eye can see, and instantly strike through the hearts of the witch's enemies, aren't you?`
` And I am giving you an order as your master!!"`
`"Carry it out right away!`
` Kill them!!`
` KILL THEM AA{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}AALL!!"`
`"........................A‐Ange‐sama......`
` ...Please, calm down......"`
`If they had immediately followed my brutal order, and left corpses strewn all around me...`
`......I would have been ready to rue my own reckless actions of stealing human lives so readily—I was ready to regret and feel remorse, just as they had wanted me to.`
`I was prepared to go through that.`
`And yet, Lucifer just let an unsure expression rise to her face, and didn't move to carry out my order.`
`..................I was aware.`
`Of course I was.`
` ......Vaguely.`
`{n}No, that's not it.`
` ......I {i:knew} it from the very beginning.`
`I knew, didn't I......that magic was all empty......`
`"......The Seven Sisters of Purgatory? Yeah, right...`
` ......Worthless, worthless...`
` ............I knew it from the very beginning......"`
`"............A‐......Ange‐sama...`
` ............{nobr:g—...{m:-5:———}—}......!!!"`
`I glared into the worthless Lucifer's eyes.`
`...And it seemed that pain accompanied that stare.`
`{n}As though she had been struck by a horrendous headache, Lucifer clutched her head with both hands.`
`But it looked like she couldn't tear her eyes off my glare.`
`{n}......So the pain assaulting her grew more and more intense.`
`"......................................."`
`"Guhgggg, a......ghhhgaaa, agaa.........!!`
` Ahghhk!!!"`
`You are useless, useless......!!`
` I HATE you!!`
` Disappear...!!`
` {i:You're nothing but a delusion inside my head}...!!!`
`Hopelessness and disappointment.`
` Resignation and a dream's end.`
` A cracking sound, like you'd hear from a frozen lake's surface during a fierce winter, rang out just once.`
`Simultaneously, Lucifer's form, tormented by violent pain, stiffened in place and grew cloudy.`
`......It was almost as though a beautifully polished glass window...`
`had been heartlessly smashed and turned white from the countless cracks.`
`And that was an accurate analogy.`
` At some point, Lucifer's form had turned into a glass ornament of the same shape.`
`Countless fissures ran through it from the inside, and the head and arms fell to pieces as it crumbled to the floor.`
`"Hiiyii?!!"`
`"L‐Luci‐nee...!!"`
`"............Who's the second sister...?`
` Leviathan?`
` Carry out my order.`
` Kill them all right NOW!!"`
`"W‐well, um!`
` ......Err, Ange‐sama...`
` ......Please calm your heart and listen...`
` We, umm,`
` .........{m:-5:——}—...`
`mmgwaaGHHggggggah{m:-5:—}—`
`GAHAGH!!"`
`I'm not looking for excuses or back talk or a reply.`
`{n}......I want nothing more than a swift confirmation of my order to eradicate the girls who are humiliating me.`
`If you're going to say anything else, there's no need for me to listen until the end.`
`After Leviathan turned white from the vast number of cracks throughout her whole body,`
` frozen in a bent‐backwards pose, she toppled over, and her fragile neck, hips and arms broke into separate parts.`
`It would have been less brutal if they had just smashed to smithereens instead of retaining their original form.`
`So the fact that I had left the two of them partially intact...`
`made the remaining younger sisters shake even harder...`
`"......Why won't you listen to my orders...?`
` Why?`
` WHY?!!"`
`"M‐my apologies...!!`
` H‐here, under the current conditions, the anti‐magic power is...e‐extremely strong...and—"`
`"{i:What}.`
` You can't do it because {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s are here? {i:That's} your logic?`
` Isn't killing {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s what you {i:do}?!`
` If you can't do that, then WHAT USE are you as furniture?!!`
` DIE!!!"`
`"Hiii—!!"`
`"P‐please, spare me, Ange‐samaaaaa......ah,`
` nghk,`
` ghhgaaaah, khack!!"`
`As she clutched her head with both arms, Satan also turned white and fell down face first.`
`The neck really did seem to be the most fragile part.`
`{n}Her head broke off weightily and rolled over to Belphegor's feet.`
`"You can't do it because there are too many {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s?`
` Then if I were to call them into the shadows later one by one,`
` you're saying you guys could make a bloodbath of all of them?"`
`"......With your current magical power, it may be easy for you to converse with us.`
` However, you still lack the training in magical power to manifest us in front of all of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s here...!"`
`"I deeply understand your anger, but even if you could use us to attack,`
` murdering everyone here would only make the situation worse...!`
` I do think it humiliating, but please, if you could control your anger for the time being—"`
`".........ggg, gah,`
` ......ghhhhh...ggg...gaHAGHHH!!"`
`"...............Will I get the same answer from the remaining three...?`
` Going to tell me you can't do it because the anti‐magic power is too great?`
` Going to tell me you can't do it because my magical power is too weak?"`
`"......Then I won't ask you to kill all of them.`
` Let's see you just kill one.`
` Right here, right now...!!"`
`As Asmodeus and Beelzebub held each other, they crouched down, cringing in fear under my glare.`
`......If they had been able to obey my order, they would probably have carried it out immediately.`
`{n}And yet, here they were crouching down.`
`......Empty.`
` Sad.`
` And pathetic......`
`That's right—I knew it.`
` These girls can't touch reality with even a single one of their fingers......`
`"N‐...no, no...!!`
` Belzie, I'm scared, Belzieeeee!!"`
`"Ange‐sama, spare us, spare us...!!`
` I don't want to diiiiiiiieee!!"`
`"Die, useless furniture!`
` Why are you guys even alive?`
` Why are you alive when your lives are worthless?`
` You could just die.`
` Die, please.`
` Drop fucking dead!!`
` Do you think there's anyone stupid enough to leave furniture lying around without a use?!"`
`""HiiiIiiI!!`
` {m:-5:———}—gaaahh!!!""`
`"P‐please stop, Ange‐sama!!"`
`"......What is it, Mammon?`
` Will you be the only one to fulfill my order?`
` Of course you will.`
` You're my best friend.`
` ............You alone will do what the others wouldn't...`
`and {i:kill them}!"`
`"............A‐as you are now, Ange‐sama, ......even if you use us, you're not capable of committing murder!!`
` It is the duty of furniture to help with things its master can do...!"`
`"Things that even the master can't do, we can't do...!!`
` Do you hate these girls, Ange‐sama?`
` You hate them, don't you?"`
`"I understand why you want to kill them, really, I do!!`
` Alright, in that case, let's go ahead and kill them, Ange‐sama!`
` If you will stain your own hands with blood, then we, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, will go along with you however far! However far!!"`
`"......I'm......asking you guys.........because I can't do it myself, aren't I......`
` ......Isn't being able to do things I can't...the thing that makes you furniture?!!"`
`"Yes, we are furniture.`
` Furniture to be used...!!"`
`"Please, go ahead and use us to kill!`
` You'll be the one killing, Ange‐sama!!`
` If you're saying that you want to kill, then go ahead, be my guest!`
` No need to hesitate, please, go and carry it out right now!!"`
`"And once you have that level of mental resolve,`
` once you're prepared to dirty your own hands—then, we will help you!`
` But you haven't reached that stage!!"`
`"Pft, .........heheheheh, ahahahahaha...`
` Ahahahahahahahaha, don't speak, you furniture.`
` You DELUSION!!"`
`"I get it already, don't make me say it all out loud.`
` ...You guys can't do anything.`
` You are nothing more than my delusions, illusions, daydreams...!"`
`"I haven't had a single friend from the very beginning.`
` You're just a phantom, a pretend friend lonely old me created inside my heart, aren't you?`
` I knew that—from the very beginning!!!"`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Yes, that's right!`
` We're a fantasy inside your head, got a problem with that?`
` Yes, it's truuue!"`
`"We're just imaginary friends,`
` created to soothe lonely, lonely Ange‐sama's heart because she doesn't have a single solitary friend, wanna say something about it?"`
`"If you want to look at reality, just look at it.`
` Stop looking at us and go back to being yourself over there, completely boxed in and bombarded with abuse!!"`
`"Go on then, go on, back you go, back to reality!!`
` Just call on us only when it's convenient for you and pretend you have friends,`
` set us on your enemies when you don't have the guts to dirty your own hands, and deny and erase us once you realize that's not gonna work!"`
`"Yes, I'll leave with a shriek of anguish just like you want, go ahead and enjoy it!!"`
`"Just copy the jeering that you're being bombarded with right now,`
` and do the same to us to get it off your chest."`
`"That too is the duty of furniture!!`
` Getting slammed against the floor when someone's pissed off is also a chair's important duty!!"`
`"If by that trifling service we manage to absorb our master's bad mood even for an instant,`
` there can be no greater honor for furniture.`
` Kill me, deny me, your first and final friend...!!!!!!!"`
`At the end, Mammon had a derisive expression on her face,`
` ......but for some reason it looked like teardrops had scattered from her eyes.`
`Mammon, Beelzebub and Asmodeus smashed to pieces and rolled across the floor......`
`‘.........U‐......uryu..................’`
`"..................`
` Come over here, Sakutaro.`
` Ange is just a little agitated right now.`
` ......So you mustn't get close."`
`‘What about the others?`
` Are the Seven Sisters alive?`
` Did they die...?’`
`"......It's alright.`
` It looks very gruesome, but those are the remains of their vessels after they were forcibly evicted from the human world.`
` They're shells that have been shed."`
`"......So it's alright.`
` They're probably deeply hurt, but they're safe.`
` They're all alive.`
` I'm sure we'll be able to meet them again someday."`
`‘Uryu...`
` ......Thank goodness..........thank goodness............’`
`"......Ange, you violated the treaty of Mariage Sorcière.`
` ......Doing such a horrible thing, ......even though witches of the alliance must respect and accept one another......`
` They were all your precious friends......"`
`"No witches' alliance has anything to do with this.`
` Magic friends? Give me a break.`
` .........I killed them, erased them.`
` I smashed the Seven Sisters!"`
`‘Uryu......that's so cruel......so cruel.........’`
`"......Just give it a rest with this playing witches thing.`
` .....Please.`
` Maria onee‐chan and Sakutaro, I want you to disappear by yourselves.`
` .........Because even amid my delusions, ......I don't want to kill or erase you."`
`‘W‐...we aren't delusions......`
` We're your friends, Ange... Uryu.........!’`
`Sakutaro sobbed those words as he hid behind Maria onee‐chan.`
`.........Sakutaro doesn't exist.`
`Sakutaro is also...a delusion Onee‐chan created to distract herself from her loneliness.........`
`‘U‐......uryu, .........it hurts, ......it hurts, Maria......`
` ......Why? Why...?`
` Uryu.........uryu.........’`
`"Stop it.`
` Denying my friend is the one thing I will not permit."`
`The same power that had smashed the Seven Sisters was probably eating into Sakutaro as well.`
`......But Maria onee‐chan was apparently protecting him with some other power.`
`So Sakutaro's form didn't break or scatter.`
`Onee‐chan glared at me sharply.`
`{n}......A serious expression that she had never shown me before.`
`"Sakutaro is my furniture.`
` You cannot erase him, Ange.`
` ......That you would try to deny him regardless is the greatest contempt you could show a witch."`
`"Sakutaro never existed in the first place.`
` He's just a lion stuffed animal.`
` Just a phantom you personified in the delusions inside your own mind!"`
`"Uu!!!`
` That's not true!!`
` Sakutaro is my friend!!`
` He was a stuffed animal once, but now he isn't!!"`
`"No, he's a stuffed animal.`
` A stuffed animal made of cloth and cotton!`
` He can't move or talk by himself!`
` You're just talking for him like a ventriloquist!"`
`"Is that what you call magic?`
` Is that what you call a witch?!`
` Is that what you call......a friend?!`
` I can't accept that!!"`
`‘........................Uryu......`
` .........Am I...`
`......not me......?’`
`‘......Am I......just a stuffed animal that...`
`can't really talk and...`
`.........not your...`
`...friend...`
`............after all............?’`
`‘U......ryu.........’`
`As though plagued by a high fever, Sakutaro weakened bit by bit.`
`As he clung to Onee‐chan's body, he did all he could to continue standing,`
` ......but his body began to slip down bit by bit...`
`As he did, Onee‐chan held him, and screamed at me as tears streamed down her face...`
`"Uuuu!!`
` Stop iiiit!!`
` Don't burn Sakutaro with the anti‐magic toxin!!`
` Don't bully him!!`
` Don't insult him!`
` Don't deny him!!!!!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*!!`
` Maria onee‐chan, you're weeeeird!!`
` There is no Sakutaro~!`
` Stuffed animals are stuffed anima~ls!"`
`"I learned from Mama that they're made of cloth and cotton~!!`
` There's no way they can walk or tal~k!!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!!"`
`‘.........Uryu........................u...yu...............’`
`"Sakutaro!!`
` Sakutaroo!!!`
` He's not a stuffed animal, he's not a stuffed animal, he's a friend!!`
` Uuu!!!`
` Waa{0}aAA{0}Aa{0}a{0}aAa{0}a{0}aahhhh!!!!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!`
` I don't wanna play with stupid animals, let's all play outsi~de!!`
` I'm bored with animals no~w!!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"NO, you're not my friend any more!!`
` Uu!!`
` Why would you say that, I hate you I hate you I hate you I hate you!!`
` I HATE YOU!!"`
`You're not my friend!!`
` I won't let you be one of us witches anymore...!!`
`Upon my name, the Apprentice Witch of Origins {f:5:Maria},`
` I hereby expel the apprentice witch {f:5:Ange} from the Mariage Sorcière Alliance of Witches......!!`
`.........And then.`
`...Those tranquil days of mine, now merely a waking dream, came to an end.`
`At this point, it's unverifiable.`
`No one can verify whether that really was magic, and those really were my friends,`
` or else whether it was all nothing more than a daydream.`
`......I, the sole observer, concluded that those girls were a figment of my imagination.`
`......So that became the truth.`
`Perhaps, further in the future, I will observe it again, and when that happens, maybe I will acknowledge that it wasn't a dream,`
` ......that the Seven Sisters really were my friends, and that along with Maria onee‐chan and Sakutaro,`
` they did everything they could for me in my isolation.`
`..................Something so vague is neither the truth nor even an illusion.`
`Maybe the reality that's here and now is the only real world, with the real me.`
`Where is the real me?`
`The person standing among the girls' shameful remains resembling broken glass sculptures,`
` breathing harshly and shoulders heaving, ...that is not me.`
`The place {i:I} am......is over there.`
`The one boxed in by a crowd, the one being subjected to constant verbal abuse, ...the one hanging her head, with clearly red eyes.........`
`......The me over there,`
` .........isn't {i:that} the real me......?`
`I won't...dream...anymore.`
`{n}Because there's nowhere...for me to run.`
`I'll...go back.`
` ......I'll return myself...to the cage made of flesh......`
`"Hey!!`
` Are you listening to us?!`
` Standing there hanging your head forever won't solve anything, you know?!"`
`"..............................`
` ......I hear you."`
`"Ah, you finally answered.`
` Are you thinking that this'll end eventually if you just stay silent, or that we'll forgive you if you cry, or something like that?!`
` We're asking if you are aware!`
` We're asking if you are aware of the trouble you're causing those around you...!!"`
`.........I...slowly nodded.`
` ...I admitted it.`
`I admitted that I had been spending my time in a waking dreamland, trying to remain separate from the others in my class.`
`......Those "friends" who had spoken to me with such kind and hopeful words,`
` yet who couldn't offer me any help at all now in the moment I truly wanted it—`
`to move on from them and to sully them,`
` ......I admitted it.`
`"...I, Ushiromiya Ange, caused trouble for my classmates by not having a cooperative attitude.`
` The reason for it is nothing more or less than my excessive inferiority complex towards all of my classmates because of my inability to study.`
` And.............................."`
`".........there's no point in me being alive."`
`Starting there, I was no longer reading the paragraph they had made me write.`
`......It was my...improvisation.`
` And...what was in my heart.`
`They also noticed that it wasn't what they had anticipated,`
` but while they did frown, no one spoke.`
`So I continued.`
`"......That's right.`
` There was no point in my life continuing.`
` ......I was meant to have been taken with them on that day in 1986.`
` ......And yet, I was the only one who didn't get to be taken."`
`"......Why am I here, I wonder?`
` ...This isn't the world I'm meant to be in.`
` ............No one will save me here."`
`"...For a time, ......I felt as though the fictional friends I created inside myself would save me.`
` But those friends were nothing more than a delusion, ......and they did no such thing.`
` After all, this isn't a fantasy world—it's the real world."`
`".........So, in short, ......up until today, ......I've been living in a daydream.`
` ...Averse to my real classmates, I lived only by interacting with the friends in my delusion.`
` .........Just now, I split up with those friends.`
` And here I am."`
`"............I have no family.`
` I've discarded my friends.`
` ......There is no longer anything left for me."`
`"......Why haven't I died?`
` One of you asked me that just now.`
` ...I think you're absolutely right.`
` Why.........am I alive, I wonder?`
` ..................I should have been dead............in 1986.`
` ...No, I did die then, I'm sure of it."`
`"But even so, ............my soul that was killed is still locked up inside this cage of flesh.`
` So I'll ask this of one of you.`
` If no one responds, ......I'll do it myself."`
`"Someone,`
` .....................please let me die."`
`I spoke that sentence, and looked around.`
`Dumbfounded girls.`
`{n}Shocked girls.`
`{n}Girls who looked like they didn't know what this kid was saying.`
`And, after a small delay,`
` more and more girls with faces that said "Is this kid alright?"`
`Whisper whisper.`
` Mutter mutter.`
` And then, giggle giggle.`
`.........When I ordered my friends in my daydream to kill, they couldn't do it.`
`And so,`
` I asked real {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s to kill,`
` ......but of course, these girls can't do it either.`
`......In other words, both daydreams and reality are the same.`
`Doesn't that mean that everything, absolutely everything, this world included...`
`{n}............is all a daydream?`
`Then......what's the problem.`
`After all, ......on that day when I lost my entire family, ...I already died.`
`......All the days since have been the delusions of a wrongful survivor—delusions of a life flashing before my eyes.`
`Once I understood that, ...............it felt like all the scenery surrounding me began to twist and bend slightly.`
`.........Ah.`
`{n}...I'm finally going to.........wake up.`
`{n}...I'm going to be released...from this world of waking dreams.`
`I felt my consciousness sliding away.`
`......That's alright.`
` Fade further and further away, ............and take me to my family......`
`Therefore, no matter what unfolded in this twisted, faded world, I paid it no mind at all.`
`I saw the crowd get pushed aside as a teacher stepped in.`
`Perhaps a teacher doing the rounds happened to notice a strange disturbance.`
`The teacher was vigorously shouting something, moving to protect me.`
`......Upon seeing that, and learning that an ally had appeared for me, even if only one,`
` I felt my awareness return very slightly.`
`..................`
`......The only ones who can save me in the real world...are real {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.`
`Never again.`
` ......Never again will I seek salvation from daydreams.`
`.........This is the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world.`
`The only ones who can save a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}...are other {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s......`
`"...........................`
` ......Yes.`
` If that's what you think, then that's your world, Ange."`
`‘......Can Ange...`
`...become happy this way.........?’`
`".........If Ange believes that is the only way to become happy, then it is the only way.`
` ...If she cannot accept the blue bird in the cage for what it is,`
` ...then she must go and search forever."`
`‘Uryu......`
` ...Maria, are you......breaking off relations with Ange.........?’`
`"..............................`
` ......No, nothing like that.`
` I only did that because it was what Ange wanted.`
` ......We witches are sometimes persecuted.`
` However, we are always close by.`
` ......And our aid will surely be sought."`
`‘......Will the day come.........when Ange will play with us again......?’`
`"It may be that it never comes, and we will simply be forgotten.`
` ...In the human world, they call that growing up, or moving on.`
` ............Still."`
`If Ange just remembers, we will always be by her side.`
`......And until then, ......we will be waiting.`
`..........................................`
`‘........................Uryu...`
` .........Maria, ...answer me......’`
`"..........................."`
`‘.........Uryu...`
` ......So I really am...`
`...a stuffed animal...?`
` ......I'm made of cloth and cotton,`
` ......so there's no way I can...`
`talk......?`
` ......Is that why...`
`...I can't talk to you.........?’`
`Sakutaro looked up at Maria sadly.`
`Maria's face was covered with tears, and she looked as though she had even lost the emotion of sadness......`
`"............Uu.`
` ......I can hear you, Sakutaro.`
` ......You aren't a stuffed animal made of cloth and cotton.`
` .........You're my...friend.`
` ..................Hate Ange.`
` ......Uuu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}uuu......"`
`‘Uryu... I'm sorry Maria, I'm sorry Maria......!`
` Uryu......!’`
`Sakutaro felt regret.`
` By freezing her heart, Maria had finally been able to escape from her sadness.`
`...By speaking up and calling her back, he had caused her to become overwhelmed with sadness again...`
`Sakutaro tried toddling up to Maria and hugging her, then letting go,`
` gazing at her appearance uneasily and trying it again, lost as to how he could bring Maria's spirits up.`
`......He might have looked a little humorous doing that.`
`As a result, that was able to divert Maria's feelings from sadness......`
`"Sorry.`
` .........More crying won't help anything."`
`‘You got in a fight with Ange, but you still have a lot of friends, Maria...`
` Not just me.`
` .........You have everyone else too.`
` Sakusuke and Sakukichi, the animal band, and many, many more......’`
`Maria looked at the many stuffed animals around her pillow, which were gathered together as though they were having a conference.`
`‘......They're all...worried about you, Maria.`
` They've all been discussing and discussing how to cheer you up, you know......?’`
`"....................................`
` ......They won't......go away...like Ange...?"`
`‘They won't.`
` We'll always be together.’`
`".........Really?`
` You're all only with me at home.`
` Can't go out together when Mama's with us, and can't go together to school."`
`‘We aren't allowed to go to school, so you'll get in trouble if the teacher finds out.`
` But if no one finds out, we can be together at any time.’`
`"......Sakutaro, you're big, so you'd be found."`
`‘Then you can take some of the kids that are small enough to walk around with.`
` ......For example...what about them?`
` If you take the friends in the forest band,`
` ......look, they're small, so they can hide in your pocket and go to school with you.’`
`".........There's a lot of them in the band.`
` Can't fit them all in my pockets."`
`She gathered all of the forest band pieces that were scattered across her bed.`
`There were about as many of them as pieces in a chess set, so it would probably be impossible to fit them all in her pocket...`
`‘In that case, you can just take friends that you're especially close with.`
` ......Why don't you take the four rabbits, the ones you're closest to in the forest band?’`
`"......Four could fit in my pocket.`
` ......Yeah.`
` This way, they won't be found."`
`‘So this way, you won't be alone even at school, Maria.`
` Those kids will be with you even where I can't go.’`
`"...............Yeah.`
` ......Maybe...won't be lonely that way.`
` ......Maybe I can hold out......until I get home from school..."`
`‘As long as we aren't found by the teacher or Mama, we can be with you at any time.`
` So let's be together forever, play together forever.`
` We definitely won't leave you all alone, Maria.`
` Uryu!’`
`Maria's expression finally regained a little of its brightness.`
`......That's right.`
` Thinking about it, my world didn't start out with Ange in it.`
`Even without Ange, everyone was together and it was fun.`
`So it's weird to suddenly get sad just because Ange's gone when she was the last to come in.`
`...All that's happened is that I've returned to the world right before Ange entered it.`
`{n}......So there's nothing to be sad about.`
`"......Yeah.`
` Not lonely.`
` Sakutaro and everyone else is with me."`
`‘Uryuu!`
` Loooove you, Maria...!’`
`"I won't let any more {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s come into my world.`
` ......Mariage Sorcière is an alliance only between me and {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......Even Beato opposed letting Ange join in the beginning.`
` .........It's alright this way.`
` Ange was still too young."`
`‘......Until you can be friends with Ange again, I think it's okay to forget about her for now.`
` Just wait until you've regained your high spirits, and then play with her again.`
` Until then, all of us will be by your side.’`
`".........Thanks.`
` ......Sakutaro, ......everyone."`
`Then, I once again regained my former world.`
`{n}I regained the world where I wasn't lonely, and where I was surrounded by many friends.`
`As always, I didn't have any {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} friends at school, but my magic friends were always with me.`
`Even during class, I could hear the rabbit band hiding in my pocket talking together and giggling, and they sounded like they were having a lot of fun.`
`Just listening to that added a lot of color to those lonely school hours.`
`I made sure that my other friends, too, were always with me, as long as Mama and the teacher wouldn't find out.`
`When Mama told me to go play outside, I would secretly pack Sakutaro and Sakusuke and the rest into my bag, and play together at the library or somewhere.`
`And when Mama was late coming home and I went shopping for dinner, I always went with them.`
`The men working at the convenience store were always nice to Sakutaro.`
`{n}Sometimes they even gave me two extra things for free, one for me and one for Sakutaro.`
`Whenever Mama found out, I would get in trouble for bringing Sakutaro and the rest outside.`
`Whenever the teacher found out, I would get in trouble for bringing toys to school.`
`The toxin must be strong in Mama and the teacher.`
` That's why Sakutaro and the others just look like normal stuffed animals to them.`
`After all, the men at the convenience store say hello to Sakutaro.`
`.........Not all {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s are worthless.`
` There are a ton of people who, unlike Ange and Mama and my teacher, can say hello to magic friends like I can......`
`"Oh, Maria‐chan.`
` Welcome.`
` Is your mama late coming home tonight too...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ......But Sakutaro's with me, so I'm not lonely.`
` Right, Sakutaro?"`
`‘Uryuu.`
` It's not just me today.`
` Other friends are also with us.’`
`"Oh, other friends?`
` What kind of friends are with you today?"`
`"Today, the rabbits from the forest band are also with me.`
` ......Look, they're in my pocket."`
`Maria began to line up four ceramic rabbit dolls on the register.`
`As the owner of the shop looked at them with a smile, he signaled a part‐timer with his chin.`
`The sign on the other register that said "closed" was taken down, and the part‐timer called out for everyone to move over there.`
`All of the people in line behind Maria formed a new line over there instead...`
`"Yes, I see.`
` You sure have a lot of friends, Maria‐chan.`
` But I hope your mama comes home soon."`
`"Uu.`
` Mama is busy with work again, so she's staying at the company.`
` She's very busy lately.`
` ......She hasn't even been able to get much time to talk to me on the phone."`
`"But I'm not lonely!`
` I have Sakutaro and all the rest!`
` Right?"`
`‘Uryuu!!’`
`"All of the rabbits in the band are with me too.`
` Look.`
` Kyuu‐kyuu{p:0:♪}"`
`"Is kyuu‐kyuu the sound a rabbit makes?`
` Come to think of it, I've never heard one."`
`After smiling at Sakutaro, who was poking his head out of her knapsack,`
` she played around with the rabbit band on the register, making them frolic around.`
`Even as he gazed at this heartwarming sight, the shop manager had a slightly pitying look on his face.`
`......This was apparently a family without a father, and where the mother had to work hard and couldn't come home very often.`
`On top of that, it looked like this girl didn't even have any friends.`
`As he watched this girl play around happily with her dolls and claim that she wasn't lonely despite everything,`
` he couldn't help but feel a kind of compassion.`
`And actually, this wasn't limited to him alone.`
` Maria had become very famous in this shopping district...`
`"Maria‐chan, you should eat some oden every once in a while.`
` You won't grow if you don't eat your eggs and fish paste."`
`"Uu?`
` Can't get a cream roll...?"`
`‘Uryu.`
` You need variety or you won't get big.`
` How about oden for today?’`
`"Uu.`
` ......Okay, I'll have oden."`
`"Yep yep, that's the ticket.`
` Why don't I stick a whole bunch in there.`
` Want mustard?"`
`‘Uryuu.`
` I can't handle spicy things......’`
`"Alright, I see.`
` Then, you make sure you don't let it spill on the way home.`
` Best eat it while it's hot."`
`"Uu.`
` Thank you."`
`She had planned on getting some sweet pastries for dinner like usual, but since oden had been recommended to her, she would be having that tonight instead.`
`Letting someone else determine the menu makes for an unexpected and interesting meal.`
`......Very often, Maria had to decide on her own what to have for dinner, so it was easy for the menu to get a little one‐sided.`
` So it felt fun to look forward to a meal she hadn't anticipated...`
`‘Uryuu!`
` Thanks for giving us extra, mister!’`
`"Send my regards to your other friends at home.`
` No nibbling at it on the way home, now.`
` Go straight home and eat it there."`
`"Uu!`
` Thanks, mister!!"`
`Maria held the bag with the oden container high for all to see......`
`".................................`
` .........Huh......?"`
`‘......Uryu?`
` What is it, Maria?’`
`".........The key isn't in my pocket."`
`Standing in front of the door to her house, Maria searched and patted all over her body.`
`{n}......The key to the house wasn't there.`
`She always methodically put it in the same pocket.`
` So there was no way she had put it in another pocket, but she searched her whole body just in case.`
`......It really wasn't there.`
`‘Did you drop it when you took your wallet out......?’`
`"No.`
` Definitely felt it when I took my wallet out.`
` Also definitely felt it when I checked my pocket on the way home."`
`"......It was there until partway.`
` Didn't drop it!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu...!"`
`The late autumn wind had been made bearable by the thought of the heater that was waiting at home,`
` but now that Maria had lost her key and had no idea what to do, she was really feeling it.`
`But no matter how hard she searched, she couldn't find her key.`
` She turned out all her pockets, and even tried taking off her jacket and hitting it, but to no avail.`
`......Of course, she also turned the knapsack Sakutaro was in upside down, but no key came out.`
`".........Uu.`
` .........Uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`Something that should have been there...wasn't where it was supposed to be.`
`{n}Why isn't the key there, when I didn't do anything wrong?`
`......Why isn't it?!`
`{n}Why?!`
` Why...?!!!`
`Maria stamped on the ground, cold and frustrated and angry...`
`{n}The bottom of her foot throbbed, but even so, it didn't lessen her frustration.`
`......Before long, bitter tears were pouring down her face.`
`"......Uu.`
` ......Uu!!`
` Uuuu!!"`
`It wasn't her fault.`
` So it was someone else's.`
`But Maria didn't know who that someone was, and could do nothing but continue to let out a moan of anger.`
`‘......Uryu......`
` You must have dropped it partway...`
` Let's look for it, okay?`
` Let's go back the way we came and search, okay...?’`
`"......Uu...`
` I was excited to buy oden, ......and I got eggs and stuff for free......`
` Can't eat it while it's hot......`
` .........Uuuuu!!!"`
`‘...Maria......I know it's frustrating, but let's search, okay...?`
` It's no one's fault... Let's search...’`
`Maria finally lent an ear to Sakutaro's words, and began to plod back the way she came.`
`......The wind was colder than it had been, and felt like it was blowing in through the gaps in her jacket to spite her...`
`‘Uryu...`
` Let's watch our feet closely and search, okay...?`
` And then let's get home quickly, and eat oden while getting warm by the heater, okay?`
` I'm sure it'll taste good.’`
`".........Uu.`
` ......Not here.`
` ......Uu.`
` ......Not here..."`
`As Sakutaro encouraged her, Maria searched for the key...`
`But she made it all the way back to the convenience store where she'd bought the oden.`
`{n}......She hadn't found it.`
`Just in case, she asked the man at the convenience store whether they had found a dropped key,`
` but they hadn't found anything.`
`......One more time, she returned home, paying close attention to the area around her feet.`
`{n}But still—she didn't find it.`
`She was no longer frustrated enough to stomp her feet.`
`{n}......But hot tears dripped down her face.`
`The oden was stone cold.`
`...Even though the man at the shop had said to eat it while it was hot, she hadn't been able to.`
`......He had given her so much extra stuff for free......`
`‘......Uryu......`
` Don't cry......`
` ......Mama isn't coming back tonight.`
` ......Let's do our best to search......’`
`".........Why can't I find it...`
` ......Uuuu............uuuuuuuu!"`
`‘Maria, don't cry...!`
` Let's do our best to search...!`
` .........Maria......’`
`Maria was no longer able to hold back her tears.`
`Sobbing, clutching Sakutaro, and with the oden bag in her hand, she returned once more down the road she had come by.`
`Perhaps because it was now later at night, and more houses and stores had turned their lights off by now, it was even darker and harder to search than before.`
`......And, once again without finding the key, she returned to the convenience store.`
`"Maria‐chan,`
` ......you still can't find your key...?"`
`"...Uu...`
` ......Key, ......gone..."`
`"Your mother was away for the night?`
` You can't get into your house without a key?"`
`"Uu......`
` ......Can't get in......"`
`"Well, that is a pretty pickle...`
` Did you try going to the police?`
` It might have been handed in."`
`"...............Mama said not to talk to policemen, even if they start talking to me."`
`"Hm? Now why on Earth is that?"`
`"................................."`
`It was probably because Rosa felt guilty for making such a young girl as Maria watch over the house by herself,`
` and because she knew that this was not socially acceptable.`
`So she had indoctrinated Maria into changing the stores she bought things at so that she didn't catch the eyes of adults,`
` and saying no more than a greeting to policemen, even if they talked to her.`
`Maria had obediently done as she was told.`
`Instead of considering why she had to do that,`
` honestly obeying because her mother had told her so was far more important to her.`
`But the manager of the convenience store probably didn't think of it that way.`
`......Naturally, seeing such a young girl being forced to watch over the house alone,`
` and so frequently, would cause anyone to worry......`
`......And then.`
` After making the round trip between her home and the store once more, and arriving at the convenience store for a third time...`
`...a policeman was there.`
`"That's the girl.`
` ......Maria‐chan, did you find your key?"`
`".........Uu...`
` ......Can't find it......"`
`"What's your name, little girl?"`
`"........................"`
`The policeman asked her name, but Maria didn't answer.`
`"Did your mother tell you not to talk with policemen?`
` Hahah.`
` Don't worry, no need to be scared of me.`
` Have you eaten dinner yet, little girl?"`
`".........Bought it, but can't get into the house, so I can't eat it."`
`"What's your mother doing?`
` Is she not coming home today?`
` Is she working?"`
`"..................Uu."`
`"Do you know how we can contact your mother's work?"`
`"........................"`
`Maria hung her head limply.`
`......She didn't understand why the policeman was getting mad at her.`
`No, he probably wasn't getting mad at her, but if this reached her mother's ears, she would definitely be in trouble.`
`Even if she didn't understand the reason why she would be in trouble, she at least understood that much.`
`But the policeman wouldn't let Maria go.`
`{n}And her head was swimming from hunger.`
`The policeman noticed that, and it was decided that they could talk as they ate in the police box.`
`......I was taken to the police box.`
` I had my oden heated in a microwave oven, and there were even {ruby:shio daifuku:salty rice cakes} and hot tea brought out for me.`
`I'd been told not to talk to policemen,`
` ......but as I answered questions about Sakutaro, I started to feel like he wasn't a bad person, and...`
`...I wouldn't be able to return home anyway, so I didn't know what to do, so...`
`.........I told him Mama's work phone number,`
` ......which I wasn't supposed to tell anyone, and was told to use only in a very, very serious situation.`
`In the tatami room inside the police box, as I ate the oden that was so hot it felt like it would burn me,`
` I watched the policeman making the phone call, and lazily thought, "......aah, I'm probably going to get in trouble..."`
`"............Is Mama...going to be mad at me.........?"`
`‘......Uryu.........’`
`He must have been listening to the phone ringing for a very long time.`
` With the receiver up to his ear, the policeman looked up at the clock and grumbled.`
`"............Maybe they aren't picking up because their business hours are over.`
` ......Hmmmmmm.`
` ......Ah.`
` Hello?`
` Hello?`
` Is this Auntie Rosa Co., Ltd.?"`
`"This is the Komatsugawa Police Department police box in front of Senbonzakura Station.`
` Is President...umm, {c:86EF9C:Udaikan}...no, sorry, President Ushiromiya‐san available?`
` ............Yes.`
` ......Whaat?`
` {i:Vacation}?"`
`"Yes.`
` The president's off for three days starting yesterday.`
` Umm, perhaps I could be of assistance...?"`
`"Oh no no no, that's quite alright.`
` So, do you know where she may be?`
` Have you heard how she can be contacted, by any chance?"`
`"Uhh, ......would you mind waiting for just a moment?`
` ...............Hey, anyone know where the president's taking her vacation?`
` How to get hold of her?"`
`"Heard she was going for all‐you‐can‐eat crabs in Sapporo with her boyfriend.`
` Lucky girl, cold places are great for bringing a couple closer together, don't you think?`
` Haven't heard how to get in touch with them."`
`"Okie‐dokie.`
` ......Uhh, hello.`
` I hear she went to Sapporo, but I'm not sure about how to reach her.`
` ......Can I take a message?"`
`"Hmm, I see... That's awkward.`
` Well, if you make contact with her again, could you tell her that we called?`
` Yes, that's right."`
`......After that, I was taken to the police station, which was bigger than the police box,`
` and they said I could spend the night there.`
`And they asked me all kinds of things about myself.`
`A lady who called herself the district welfare officer came by and asked about various things.`
`And she said to me, "You poor thing".`
`{n}When I heard that, I learned for the first time.`
`"............Am I.........a poor thing......?"`
`‘......Uryu......`
` That's not true... You're happy, Maria......’`
`"...............Uu..."`
`And......Rosa came back.`
`Maria was told to go to her room,`
` ...but on her way back from the bathroom, she hid by the entrance to the living room and listened in on the exchange.`
`The person who had come to visit...was the female district welfare officer who had asked Maria various questions the other day.`
`"Don't be so pushy!!`
` Maria's heart is too innocent and delicate, so if there was an insensitive kid there, she could be hurt!!`
` Please stop your unwanted meddling!!"`
`"But in that case, ma'am,`
` if the child is so delicate, why leave her home all alone?`
` Shouldn't a mother be there for her child?"`
`"I am here for her as much as I can be!!`
` I have no idea what makes you think I need ordering around...!!"`
`"Really?`
` She is very well known in this area, you know.`
` They say that your daughter frequently goes out at night to buy things and eat.`
` Everyone was worried and looking out for her."`
`"How do you know that was my child?!!`
` Children are a dime a dozen around town!!`
` Don't just assume that it's my Maria!!"`
`"Kids sometimes walk around outside at night, don't they?!`
` How can you prove that all of those are my child?!"`
`"A girl holding a lion stuffed animal often came around to eat dinner and buy things.`
` She was very famous around the shopping district."`
`"Everyone treated Maria‐chan with care out of concern for her.`
` Sometimes, people even escorted her home, thinking the streets might be dangerous at night."`
`"Y‐you can find lion stuffed animals anywhere!!`
` It was none of their business, escorting her home!!`
` Are they thinking of kidnapping her or something?!"`
`"Don't fuss over Maria!!`
` Maria is my child.`
` I am raising her!`
` I have absolutely no intention of putting her in some strange institution!!`
` Stop your needless meddling!!"`
`‘U‐......uryu......`
` Does that lion stuffed animal...`
`...mean me......?’`
`"......It's alright.`
` I'm the one who's in trouble...`
` It has nothing to do with you, Sakutaro......"`
`Maria hugged Sakutaro, continuing to watch her mother fearfully...`
`"I, I also wish I could be with Maria every day!"`
`"But I'm a single mother, so I have to work!`
` I may not look it, but I'm a president of a company, and I bear the responsibility for my employees' well‐being!!`
` I'm busy with my work all year round, there's no time for me to rest!!"`
`"{i:Really}?`
` But you've been off work for the last three days, haven't you?"`
`"I, I have not been off work!`
` I've been staying at my company for several nights working!!`
` There's a mountain of matters to be taken care of that the other unreliable employees can't handle!!"`
`"Why are you lying like that?`
` The people at your company told us that you were taking a three‐day vacation, you know?`
` You went to Hokkaido with your boyfriend, right?`
` Leaving your daughter by herself for three whole days...!"`
`"I, I don't know anything about any boyfriend I don't know anything about Hokkaido!!!`
` Why are you coming out with all this nonsense?!`
` Why, why?!`
` Do you have any proof?!`
``
` What's wrong with you, don't just start butting in on someone else's family matters!!"`
`"I love Maria, I have my own way of loving her, so just keep your mouth shut!!`
` I didn't go on a vacation, I was working the whole time, I was working!!"`
`"I was trying to finish things up at work with all my strength, all my strength because I wanted to see Maria as soon as I could!!`
` I stayed at the company working and working and working and working and working, working and working and working and working!!"`
`"I don't know anything I don't know anything, I don't know anything about Hokkaido, don't come in saying all this!!! Uuuaaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}AAa{0}a{0}aAA{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}AAHHH!!!`
` Please, just go!!`
` Just go!!!!!`
` What is wrong with you?!?!`
` Just go!!`
` JUST GO{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}OOO!!!"`
`Rosa raged, her hair flying wildly.`
`She stood up with such force that her teacup fell over,`
` and far louder than that noise was the sound of her beating the table with both hands.`
`When faced with this rage that could accurately be described as wide‐eyed derangement,`
` the female welfare officer couldn't help but be taken aback.`
`......And the same went for Maria, who was secretly watching this from the hallway.`
`She had seen her mother enraged several times before.`
`{n}But she had never seen her go this berserk with anger.`
`Seeing this, Maria was sure.`
`{n}......This was no longer her mother.`
`It was some other evil being that was possessing her mother's body...`
`And then, the evil being discovered her.`
`{n}Maria learned that she was being reflected in the evil being's eyes.`
`Her mind went blank, and she felt as though her field of vision was racing off into the distance......`
`After fiercely closing in on Maria, Rosa mercilessly bore down on her small shoulders,`
` ......and dropped her gaze onto the stuffed animal Maria was holding: Sakutaro.`
`".........Maria.`
` Even though I told you so many times not to bring that outside,`
` ......you brought it with you, didn't you?"`
`‘U‐......uryu.........`
` I‐it's not Maria's fault......`
` I said I'd come with her......’`
`"Th‐that's not true......!`
` I brought Sakutaro on my own because I was lonely...!`
` So Mama, it's not Sakutaro's fault...!!"`
`‘Uryu...... Maria.........’`
`"It's not Sakutaro's fault!!`
` It's not Sakutaro's fault!!"`
`The brunt of Rosa's anger was aimed, not at Maria, but at the lion stuffed animal Maria was holding.`
`......A girl came shopping in the middle of the night, always clutching a lion stuffed animal.`
`Because of that, she had become well known in the shopping district...`
`"I,`
` ......I,`
` ...I told you not to take stuffed animals with yo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ouuu!!!`
` Why—!!`
` Can't you—!!`
` Listen to what Mama says!!"`
`"Why?!`
` Why, why?!`
` Why can't you follow Mama's ru{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}ules!!"`
`With every single word, she stamped her heel and banged furiously on the wall.`
`......Admittedly, she wasn't making direct contact with Maria.`
`However, the violence of that harsh sound certainly beat against her.`
`"M‐Ma'am...... Stop that......!!"`
`"Let go!!`
` I said let go, damn iiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`The welfare officer had come back to her senses and put Rosa in a full nelson.`
`But the instant Rosa was touched, she went wild, furiously throwing the welfare officer off.`
`......She hit the table and fell to the ground.`
` A teacup on the table smashed on the floor, making a violent sound...`
`‘M‐......Maria didn't do anything wrong......!`
` It's my fault!`
` So don't scold Maria......!!’`
`"I'm the one who brought Sakutaro...!!`
` It's not Sakutaro's fault!!`
` It's not Sakutaro's fault!!`
` So don't look at Sakutaro with those scary eyes!!`
` Don't look at hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiim!!"`
`‘Don't scold Maria...!`
` Don't scold Maria...!!`
` Uryuuu!!!’`
`"........................Wh‐.........what in the...`
` Just what do you think you're doing?"`
`"Did you...also play with dolls like that......outside?`
` Did you do it in front of the people at the store......?"`
`"........................`
` Then OF COURSE they remembered yoooooooou,`
` THINK a little, you idiot!! Why are you such a DUMBAA{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}AAASSS!!!"`
`"Answer me honestly.`
` When you went out shopping, you always walked around with that stuffed animal without telling Mama, right?"`
`‘.........U‐......uryu.........’`
`"Stop using that weird stuffed animal talk!!!`
` Speak with your own words, not a stuffed animal's!!!"`
`"S‐Sakutaro isn't a stuffed animal!!`
` He's my friend!!`
` Don't call him a stuffed animal......`
` Dooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oon't!!"`
`"Yes, yes, fine, Sakutarou, it was called Sakutarou!`
` You took that Sakutarou doll with you all the time when you went shopping, without telling Mama, right?"`
`"Y‐......yeah..............."`
`Maria admitted it honestly.`
`If she hadn't admitted it, then Sakutaro would have said something to take the blame,`
` so by admitting it right away, she was protecting her small friend.`
`"Only Sakutarou?`
` Any others?`
` ......You haven't...been bringing weird things to school too, have you...?"`
`"......M‐Ma'am!!`
` This is not your daughter's fault!`
` Stop this interrogation at once!"`
`"You bite your tongue!!!`
` I am talking with my daughter!!!`
` ......Alright, Maria, look at Mama when you talk.`
` What's the answer to Mama's question?"`
`"U‐......uu......`
` ......Not just Sakutaro.`
` ......All the rabbits too......"`
`".........Do you have them with you now......?"`
`"Uu........."`
`Maria fished around in her pocket,`
` ......and pulled out those four ceramic rabbits with her tiny hand...`
`The rabbits were her precious friends, who could go to school with her in Sakutaro's place.`
`But when Rosa saw that, she shook her head slightly as though dizzy...`
`In Maria's {c:86EF9C:communication booklet}, a note had been written that Maria was apparently bringing toys to school and playing with them,`
` and it requested Rosa to give her home instruction to try to prevent this.`
`But Rosa had dismissed the teacher's comment as faultfinding, and on the contrary, had phoned the school to make a complaint of her own.`
`...Saying that there was no way her child would bring toys to school.`
`For nearly an hour, she had shouted at the vice principal to stop making false accusations about her daughter.`
`......To a certain degree, the school grasped that Maria was a pitiful girl.`
`They knew that the small toys she brought in were her only friends.`
`......So they had done their best to overlook it.`
`But when the other students caught sight of them,`
` some of the boys started complaining that only she was allowed to bring toys, and the school had racked their brains on how to cope with this......`
`They had tried to gently send a warning by way of the mother,`
` but after Rosa's overreaction, even Maria's teacher had decided to overlook it.`
`.........But now Rosa knew.`
`She had been the one who was wrong, ...and her daughter really had been bringing toys into school.`
`.........And the school...`
`had seen the sorry sight of her bringing toys into school and playing with them as her only friends.`
`To Rosa, who knew her daughter was a little different from normal children,`
` having this peculiar side of her daughter exposed and found fault with was more unbearable than anything.`
`.........So she howled.`
` She raged.`
`The welfare officer tried to cut between Rosa and Maria again,`
` but she only met with Rosa's wrath again.`
`Rosa once again threw the woman off with a face like a demon,`
` and when even that failed to curb her anger, she stomped on the ground over and over again so forcefully that it seemed she might break through the floor.`
`Then, after seeming to come back to her senses for just a second,`
` .........she suddenly froze her rough breathing, and asked Maria.`
`"........................`
` ......Maria.`
` Those rabbits in the band, are they your close friends?"`
`"U‐.........uu........."`
`"I see.`
` I'm glad you have a full four friends."`
`As she said that, Rosa took one of the rabbits from Maria's hand.`
`Then, she shoved it in front of Maria's eyes so she could see it very well.`
`......It was a cute little doll, like a chess piece, of a rabbit holding a trumpet.`
`She slowly lifted it into the air.`
`......Of course, Maria's and Sakutaro's eyes also followed it......`
`And then, with a speed that the eye couldn't follow, she hurled it against the wall.`
`"Eek—!!!!"`
`‘...............!!!’`
`She had half‐imagined that this worst possible thing might happen.`
`{n}So she instantly realized what had been done.`
`......So Maria let out a short, despairing scream...`
`It was in pieces.`
`It had been small and sturdy, but not enough to accept her mother's fierce rage.`
`".........Because you didn't listen to what Mama told you, one of them broke.`
` From now on, every time you disobey something Mama says, I'll break another one.`
` ......Remember that!!!"`
`"You......you call yourself a mother after doing something like that?!!`
` You think you can do something like that without hurting your daughter?!"`
`"Hurt {i:Maria}?!`
` I'm hurting too, you know?!`
` Who's gonna take responsibility for {i:my} wounds?!`
` Weeeell?!`
` WHOOOOOOOO!!!`
` I told you to bite your tongue!!!!!"`
`"S‐stop it, Mama......!`
` It's my fault...!`
` Don't get mad at this lady......!"`
`‘It isn't Maria's fault... It's mine......!`
` Don't get mad at Maria...!`
` Uryu, uryu‐uryu‐uryu, uryuuu!’`
`"I, .........I told you to stop playing make‐believe with that stuffed animaaaaaaaal!!`
` In the first place, it's disturbing, a stuffed animal is your friend? Just how old are you this year?!`
` How old?!`
` Weeelll?!"`
`"This is just a gross, crappy stuffed animal made of cloth and cotton!!`
` Is this the only kind of friend you have?!`
` If you have enough time on your hands to play make‐believe friends with this monstrous stuffed animal, go out and make some real human friends instead!!"`
`"Why is it that time goes on and on and you still can't make any friends?!!`
` That's why your class always treats you like a weirdo and makes fun of you!!`
` Cut it out, give it a rest, get ahold of yourself already!!`
` Grow up from this stuffed‐animal play!!"`
`‘Uryu......`
`uryu.........’`
`"I said...stop playing make‐believe...with that stuffed animaaaaaaaal!!"`
`"Aaah!!`
` Mama, Mama!!`
` Give him back!`
` Give Sakutaro baaaaaaaaaaack!!"`
`‘Uryuu!!`
` Uryuuu!`
` Uryu‐uryuu!’`
`Mama grabbed hold of Sakutaro's head, and snatched him from me...`
`{n}Then.........she smashed him against the wall, over and over.`
`‘Uryuu!!`
` It hurts, it hurts, ow‐ow‐ow‐ow...!!’`
`"Fucking STOP!!`
` Fucking STOP playing make‐believe with this stuffed animal!!!!!`
` It's because of this stuffed animal!!"`
`"That's why you can never make any friends!`
` That's why you're the only one in your class who sticks out like a sore thumb, and gets treated like a weird kid!!`
` I should never have given you a stuffed animal like this!!`
` I should never have given you this disgusting stuffed animal!!"`
`"Stop iiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`"Give Sakutaro back, give Sakutaro back!!`
` WaaaA{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}A{0}a{0}a{0}AahHH!!`
` Sakutaro is my friend!!`
` My best friend!!`
` I don't need anything else if I just have Sakutaro!`
` So give him back!!`
` Give him baaaaaaaack!!"`
`......For some reason, my frantic request just added oil to the fire of Mama's anger......`
`As I pulled on Sakutaro trying to take him back, Mama pushed my arm aside,`
` and in a bizarre way, she stuck her fingernails on both hands deep into Sakutaro, twisting him......`
`The red scarf, which I had carefully wrapped for him every day, came undone and fell to the floor...`
`......Sakutarou, who had been so, so precious to me......`
`He was crumpled, twisted, torn at with fingernails so much......`
`He was twisted in pain...`
`his face grimacing...`
`so sadly.........`
`Then Mama's fingernails...`
`...found a stitch on the neck`
`......and tore it...`
`......With the fingernails of both hands`
`......she tore him apart............`
`In that instant,`
` .........Sakutaro's yellow cloth,`
` .........and the cotton inside, ...burst apart......`
`It looked almost like moist cotton candy......`

` Bring him back to life with the Endless Magiiiiiic!"`
`".........Hmm...`
` ......To tell the truth...`
` Sakutarou's vessel was a stuffed animal Rosa made herself, correct...?`
` That Rosa has denied Sakutarou.`
` ......A life that is not permitted by its own mother cannot exist..."`
`{f:5:Beatrice}'s words were feeble.`
`...Because she knew that, no matter what the excuse,`
` it wouldn't be enough to calm Maria and make her accept it.`
`But she had to communicate the painful truth to her disciple and close friend.`
`.........She had to tell her the fact...`
`...that even with all of her own magic, even she could not revive Sakutarou.`
`"As long as you continue to strongly believe in Sakutarou's existence, his soul will not disappear......`
` So, {f:5:Maria}, ...please, do not be sad...`
` Even now, look, ...you must believe that Sakutarou is smiling right over there......"`
`"No!!!`
` No`
` no`
` no!!`
` You have to bring Sakutaro back to life!!`
` No no no!`
` WaaA{0}AAa{0}a{0}a{0}aAAa{0}a{0}aAa{0}aAahhhh!!"`
`"Give up...!!`
` There is no magic to revive Sakutarou...!`
` You must strongly believe that even in spite of that, Sakutarou will continue to exist as your close friend...!!`
` That power will become magic...!"`
`"That's not magic, that's not magic!!`
` You have to bring Sakutaro back to life...!!"`
`"Can't you do it because Mama made him herself?`
` Why did Mama make Sakutaro?`
` Wasn't it to give him to me as a present?`
` Wasn't it to make him my friend?"`
`"But why...did Mama make him herself...and break him herself?`
` Why did Mama create him herself, and try to break him herself?`
` Don't get it, don't get it!!"`
`"Hate Mama, hate Mama...!!`
` Can't stand it, can't stand it, it's too much, it's too much...!!`
` Want to twist Mama up like she did to Sakutaro...!`
` Want to stick my fingernails in and tear her, turn her into cloth and cotton!!"`
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!`
` Can't stand it, I can't stand it, {f:5:Beatriceeee}!!`
` Waa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh, Sakutaroooooooo!!!!"`
`From the darkness behind Maria's back, two massive jet‐black arms crept out,`
` coiling around Maria as she sobbed in anger.`
`Then massive fingernails stuck into Maria's chest and stomach......`
`Maria could not see them.`
`{n}......But Beato could.`
`Anger and sadness without any place to go will tear you apart.`
`......Beato knew that.`
` She could see that.`
`Yes.`
` ......In the end, those massive arms were Maria's own.`
`Those fingernails slowly started to dig into her chest and stomach......`
`......With their immense size and strength,`
` those arms would probably tear Maria into bits easily......`
`But Maria herself couldn't notice.`
`Drowning in a sea of her own tears, ......she couldn't notice that her own arms were trying to tear apart her own chest......`
`"Can't stand it, can't stand it...!!!`
` If Sakutaro can't be brought back to life no matter what, ......I want revenge!!`
` Want to make the same thing happen to Mama!!`
` Want to make her suffer the same thing as Sakutaro...!"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` Teach me magic for that!!`
` Teach me magic to get back at Mama...!!"`
`".................................`
` ......Are those your true feelings?"`
`"I'll kill Mama!!`
` I'll kill her!!`
` No, that's not Mama!`
` It's the bad witch possessing Mama!`
` I'll kill the witch Mama!!`
` Uuu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}uuu!!"`
`"........................`
` ......Very well.`
` I shall give you that power.`
` ......If you, beautiful of heart, shall otherwise be torn asunder by your own hand...`
`...then I find your heartless mother, who brought such suffering upon you, considerably more deserving of such a fate."`
`"...............I shall teach you.`
` ......Of the abyss in the world of witches, of the depths where no light reaches......"`
`"Uuuuuuuu, Sakutaro, Sakutaro...!!`
` I hate everyone, I hate them, I HATE THEM!!`
` Hate Mama, hate Ange!!`
` Hate everyone, EVERYONE!!`
` Uuuuuuwaa{0}a{0}aaAAA{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}AAAAHHH......!!"`
`I had been trying to take a nap, ......but the boat really was shaking bad.`
`I gave up on sleeping and went up onto the deck.`
`{n}I was welcomed by the shining sun and a strong sea breeze...`
`Up on the deck, Amakusa was doing some stretches.`
`......He probably has a lot of time on his hands too.`
`{n}It'll still take a while longer to reach Niijima.`
`It would only have taken on the order of half an hour by airplane, but there was the chance that the Sumaderas' net extended over Niijima airport.`
`The harbor would probably be the same.`
` For that reason, I had obtained a boat that would let me land while avoiding the harbor, with no questions asked.`
`I'd bumped into a cheery boat captain,`
` treated him with generosity, and he had decided to help me out, amused......`
`"Still going to be a while?"`
`"I just asked the captain, and it sounds like it'll take a full two hours more.`
` Well, beggars can't be choosers."`
`".........The weather sure is nice.`
` Feels like I'll burn."`
`"Going to read on the deck?`
` You'll damage your book."`
`Amakusa apparently got that idea because I was clutching Maria onee‐chan's diary under my arm.`
`I'd been reading it as I tried to fall asleep, which was why I had come back up still carrying it.`
`"How's it going?`
` Think you'll be able to find the truth of Rokkenjima from Maria‐san's diary?"`
`"............Who knows.`
` No matter how much I investigate what happened on that island, it won't make for anything more than a theory.`
` There's no truth written in the message bottles or Onee‐chan's diary, just a fairy tale with a witch walking around.`
` ......I'm stuck."`
`"Looks like you're just going to have to bank on what you can get out of the relevant people on Niijima."`
`"I imagine the Witch Hunters have subjected them to endless questioning, so I'm pretty sure I won't find any new facts."`
`"Hehhaha...!`
` So even though your hopes are that low, you're willing to spend a half‐day trip on a boat to go to Niijima anyway! You really are fickle."`
`".........It's like a journey of self‐satisfaction, so that I can say "I investigated".`
` I'm not so naive as to seriously think that I can unlock the truth of twelve years ago."`
`"When you've finished with your self‐satisfaction, what do you plan to do?"`
`"Who knows.`
` Haven't thought about it.`
` .........I'll go to Niijima, ask some questions of people related to all this.`
` ...Then, after going to Rokkenjima in the end and leaving some flowers, my journey will be over."`
`.........Several days had already passed since this journey began.`
`After being told by {f:5:Bernkastel} on the roof of that building...`
`to search for the truth of twelve years ago, I left on a journey akin to trying to grasp a cloud.`
`At the time, I felt something mystical about it, and I remember feeling as if I might be able to grasp some kind of miracle at the end of this journey.`
`......But several days are enough to bring a person back down from that high.`
`As I stood on the roof of that skyscraper that day, my heart had nowhere left to go—it was completely dead.`
`......Wanting from the bottom of my heart to be released from the cage of my body and rise into the sky,`
` ......I crossed the fence in order to die.`
`Maybe experiencing the desire to die and actually stepping forwards, throwing my body down...`
`caused some kind of mystical experience inside my head, making me think I had received a message from a witch.`
`.........The more the excitement from jumping down lessened over time, and the more I came back to my senses, the more this journey lost its meaning.`
`But I'd never considered suspending this journey just because of that.`
`If I stopped this journey, it would mean acknowledging that the message from that witch was an illusion.`
`And I felt as if that meant throwing away the promise the witch had made,`
` and any chance that someone from my family might come back.`
`So, I'm continuing this journey because I want to believe in that illusion.`
`I don't seriously believe that this journey will change anything.`
`{n}......I'm even free to end it at any time.`
` It's up to me to choose where the final destination is.`
`In the end, this journey is only for my personal self‐satisfaction......`
`"............Self‐satisfaction, is it.`
` It sounds bad when you say it out loud, but I think that actually, that's life."`
`"......Heh.`
` If that's the answer you reached after crawling across the line between life and death in the mercenary business, that's probably pretty deep."`
`"Don't just laugh it off.`
` What I'm trying to say is that there's no {i:self} about it—in this world, the only one {i:capable} of satisfying you is yourself."`
`Amakusa continued stretching as he spoke.`
`{n}In an annoyingly eloquent way.`
`Hearing it told to me as though from a teacher made me instinctively want to resist, but what he was saying was extremely sensible.`
`".....................`
` ......That may be true."`
`"People work hard when they want to satisfy someone.`
` ......In most cases, that someone is their parents.`
` Children learn how to work hard because they want to be praised by their parents.`
` .........Of course, that's why I never learned."`
`"Sorry, that's not what I intended to say."`
`"......What I want to say is that self‐satisfaction is {nobr:A‐OK}.`
` No matter who praises you, it's meaningless unless you yourself are satisfied.`
` ......Turning it around, even if no one praises you, that doesn't matter as long as you're satisfied yourself."`
`".........Self‐satisfaction and self‐improvement contradict each other, so we're usually taught that the former is bad.`
` Your argument is kind of a breath of fresh air."`
`"The anguish of the human world comes when you want to satisfy someone, you want recognition, but you don't know where to put the effort.`
` I had a time like that too."`
`"I wanted recognition, but I didn't know what I wanted recognition {i:for}.`
` And since I didn't know what I was meant to put effort into, or how much, or even who I wanted to give me that recognition,`
` I did a lot of crazy things."`
`"And the answer you reached......was self‐satisfaction?"`
`"It sounds bad, but that's how it is.`
` Rich is the one who is content with what they are, they say."`
`".........If I've decided this is the life I'm happy with, no one has any right to tell me any different.`
` It's the same for your life, and for this journey.`
` No one has any right to object other than you yourself."`
`"You are the only one who determines the meaning and worth of your journey.`
` If it turns out to have been a meaningful journey for you, then that's more than enough."`
`"...........................`
` .........I thought you were the kind of guy who never takes things seriously, but you really do say some weird things every once in a while.`
` I'll bet you think saying things like that every now and then will make you a hit with the ladies."`
`"You've got me all wrong.`
` That's not why I said it.`
` .........It looks like you want to be alone.`
` I'll be over with the boat captain.`
` Please, take your time."`
`It seemed Amakusa had decided I was in a bad mood.`
`{n}......Although I didn't feel that way myself.`
`Maybe he had just finished a set of stretches and wanted to cool off in the shade.`
`The sea winds were strong, but not enough to take the edge off the rays of the sun.`
`Amakusa disappeared.`
` Only I remained.`
`".........Self‐satisfaction is life, he says."`
`"That's just boring.`
` Life is nothing without greed."`
`I noticed that Mammon had suddenly appeared, her full hair streaming out in the wind by the prow of the ship.`
`"It's true that a life of greed would be fun.`
` But unlike you, {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s have a limited lifespan."`
`"If a person remains greedy for eternity, that means that they have desires even in the last moment before they die.`
` Having desires means that there's something they want.`
` Something they don't have, some way they aren't complete."`
`"......I'm sure it's tough to die when you can't think of yourself as being fulfilled.`
` So I'm sure self‐satisfaction is actually necessary."`
`".........I see.`
` Then beings with lifespans need to make that kind of compromise?`
` Our masters always had very long lifespans, so I've never thought of it."`
`"I wonder if {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s live so that they can be satisfied.`
` ......If so, to seek nothing is probably the easiest way to live.`
` ...Yes, it makes sense why greed is one of the seven deadly sins."`
`"*giggle*.`
` Your praise honors me."`
`Apparently that counted as praise in Mammon's eyes.`
`{n}She turned and gave a graceful curtsy.`
`"Ange‐sama.`
` Do {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s live so that they can be satisfied at the moment of their death?"`
`"......It must be pretty tough to be somehow incomplete at the moment of your death, right?"`
`"If so, then {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s live only so that they can have a satisfying death.`
` They live so that they can have a better death.`
` They live to die."`
`............Wow, that's a hell of a thing to say.`
`{n}...Yes, I should have expected that from a demon stake.`
`However, her words might be the truth.`
` Humans suffer because they aren't whole, and live only to be made whole.`
`That might be the same, in other words, as a desire to die—to die while whole.`
`"I have no argument against that.`
` ......People live in order to be content.`
` And they hope to die while still content.`
` So, not knowing how to make yourself content, make yourself complete, is very tough."`
`"How does a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} do that?`
` Make their life complete."`
`".........Receiving validation, acceptance.`
` That they're happy."`
`"If it doesn't matter who accepts you, then I'll do it myself, if you like."`
`"Yes, that's just it.`
` .........People don't know whose acceptance they need."`
`"So, searching for that person to accept them is the journey of life?`
` Hmmmm."`
`"It sounds strange, doesn't it?`
` Whether you find acceptance or not, it shouldn't change your circumstances.`
` ......And yet, if you find acceptance you'll be whole, and if you don't then you won't."`
`"...It's almost like the blue bird.`
` ......Even though the blue bird is already in the cage, you can't notice it, so you have to go out on a journey searching everywhere."`
`"What the heck.`
` Kyahhahaha.`
` Human lives sure are stupid."`
`"That's right.`
` Amakusa really hit on something.`
` ......Rich is the one who is content with what they are...was it?`
` I don't know where that proverb came from, but it's deep."`
`"......In short, if you won't be fully content unless you have someone's acceptance, that's the same as not being able to accept yourself.`
` ......Turns out the ultimate self‐fulfillment begins with self‐acceptance."`
`"Well, of course.`
` Because if you can become aware that you're fulfilled, there's no need for anyone else's acceptance.`
` Just by taking notice of that small little thing, a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}'s foolish lifelong journey can be ended easily."`
`"Then they can spend the rest of their life effectively, playing and having a good time.`
` A {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}'s life is so ridiculous, kyahhahahaha!"`
`Mammon's choice of words was bad, but it was surely the truth.`
`If most of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}'s life...`
`is a journey wishing for someone's acceptance so that they can achieve a satisfied death...`
`.........then the moment they realize that the person to accept them is not someone else, but them themselves, they can end that pointless journey.`
`Humans who have finished that journey can probably spend the rest of their lives as they wish with their heads held high.`
`......How sublime, how praiseworthy would that be.`
`"You know,`
` it seems Amakusa's on pretty bad terms with his parents.`
` ......Makes sense, right?`
` Amakusa's in the kind of trade that any sane parent would want their kid to wash his hands of."`
`"Why does it matter?`
` If he's enjoying it."`
`".........Exactly.`
` That's what it comes down to in the end.`
` Your worth as observed by others doesn't matter."`
`"If your existence is firmly accepted by you yourself, that's enough.`
` ......If you can live with confidence in yourself, surely you can accept and find satisfaction in any kind of lifestyle."`
`"I'm sure Amakusa will eventually eat a stray bullet on the battlefield and get seriously injured.`
` ...He might even die."`
`"But I don't think Amakusa will think of it as unfair.`
` I'm sure he'd cackle about how that too is life."`
`"What a great way to live.`
` I'm enchanted."`
`"......Pitiful {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s who can't accept themselves...`
`wander about searching for it their whole lives, doing nothing but grumbling and complaining, unable to come to terms with anything, ultimately dying while still unfulfilled."`
`"......How pitiful.`
` Compared to people whose lives drag on without any purpose,`
` Amakusa is more likely to eventually die by the roadside, but I think he's much more noble for living his life with his chest stuck out."`
`"Maybe the enlightened are the winners in life?`
` If you can come to that realization even a little sooner, you'll be able to put that much more of your life to good use."`
`.........At those words of Mammon's,`
` ......I finally came to terms with a certain fact.`
`I had......described her as an abnormal kid, a little strange.`
`However,`
` ......that wasn't the case.`
`She had simply...`
`......finished that journey faster than anyone else, and taught herself to keep her own chin up and live with confidence.`
`".....................Maybe {i:that's} what made Maria onee‐chan...so amazing.`
` She had already reached that point at the age where she was only just about to begin elementary school."`
`Other people like us, looking at her life from the outside, couldn't call it happy by any standard.`
`But even though such days were engraved in her diary,`
` ......the entries always finished up by saying it was a happy day.`
`Even though you can catch glimpses of her mother's lack of love for her,`
` in spite of that, she believed that her mother did love her.`
`The mother's love that didn't exist, she created herself, filling her world with love.`
`Others observed her as an unfulfilled, pitiful girl,`
` ......but she told herself that she was fulfilled, and accepted herself how she was.`
`And so, she was happy that way.`
`It's easy to observe that as something pitiable and sad.`
` But to her, that was an outsider's opinion, and didn't matter in the slightest.`
`The only important thing was whether or not this was happiness {i:to her}.`
`It's just like how, when people who live in the city point to the lifestyles of those in the country,`
` and lament the inconvenience and feel sympathy for them, it's really just misplaced kindness.`
`If those who live there are satisfied with what they have, that's more than enough.`
`".........I've finally realized something.`
` ...I realized it just now.`
` ......I did something horrible to Maria onee‐chan.`
` .........And to all of you, and Sakutarou as well, on that day."`
`"................................."`
`"The question of whether magic exists, or not.`
` ......That's not up to other people to decide."`
`"It's up to you yourself.`
` Whether magic exists to Maria onee‐chan is a problem for Maria onee‐chan to decide, and not for me."`
`"......And yet, when I was young, I said it, that day.`
` I told her there's no way magic exists, ......and I hurt her."`
`To me, magic doesn't exist—but that's {i:my} world.`
`{n}Denying Onee‐chan's world as well just because of that was totally barking up the wrong tree.`
`"Mariage Sorcière is the witches' alliance Maria onee‐chan created.`
` I was invited into that, and invited to become a witch with her."`
`"I thought it was a fun new game, and I went along with it for a while.`
` ......But, because of the cruelty of youth,`
` I got tired of it half‐way through.`
` And then......with sharp words, I tore her pure and innocent heart apart."`
`"......At that time, we must have gotten into a huge fight.`
` I forgot about it right away, but it was unforgettable for her.`
` ......After all, to her, magic was a natural power that emphatically existed,`
` and she believed that she'd be able to share that with me."`
`"......Magic, to Maria onee‐chan,`
` was a power by which she could give the world a happy interpretation, ......no, which could {i:make} everything happy—it truly was a magical power.`
` She just wanted to share that with me too."`
`"The young me tore those feelings apart.`
` ......So she closed herself up in a shell, believing that no one could understand magic with her."`
`".........If so, then Lady {f:5:Maria}'s life‐journey wasn't over after all.`
` If she had accepted herself, there would be no need for her to feel down just because you denied her."`
`"Onee‐chan was young.`
` She still hadn't reached the same kind of philosophical viewpoint as Amakusa.`
` ......Ahh, and that explains it perfectly.`
` Why the witches' alliance called Mariage Sorcière was necessary."`
`{m:-5:―}―An alliance where each accepts that the other is a witch.`
`"...That's right—I'm pretty sure that was the first article in the agreement of Mariage Sorcière.`
` ......Witches of the alliance must accept each other and respect each other.`
` That is the deepest and the only meaning of the witches' alliance......"`
`Maria onee‐chan wanted to share with me the secret laws for making the world happy, called magic.`
`But I was young.`
` And she was too.`
`......I hurt her with innocent cruelty.`
`".........On that day, I said it, ...those reckless words.`
` To all of you and Sakutarou.`
` I said there's no way you exist."`
`"I'm offended.`
` We accept that we exist ourselves.`
` We're not like {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, with their souls half‐asleep.`
` ......‘I think, therefore I am’."`
`"Whether you accept or deny magic, the existence of the magic called the Seven Stakes of Purgatory...is therefore a fact.`
` ......As long as we accept ourselves, to borrow your words."`
`"It truly would be violence for another person like me to deny that.`
` .........I'm sure that would be like having your true mother yell "I wish you had never been born",`
` no, "get out of my life"."`
`......Even after being slammed by all those words,`
` ......Maria onee‐chan's magic...`
`......made her believe in her mother's love.`
`Sakutarou, her magic friend, always encouraged her.`
`......He kept saying that her mother loved her, that she was coming home late because of her work,`
` and that she would definitely bring back a present.`
`Even after Maria learned the fact that it really wasn't because of work, magic still kept her believing that.`
`So by believing that her mother loved her, by accepting herself,`
` she filled her world with love and peace and serenity, ......and established it perfectly.`
`"What happened twelve years ago, ...what happened to my family.`
` ......This was...not a journey to search for that."`
`"............Then what is this journey?"`
`"It was a journey......to apologize to Maria onee‐chan for what happened that day."`
`".............................."`
`"I don't know why, but that's what I think.`
` ......If I hadn't hurt her that day,`
` .........the incident twelve years ago might not have occurred.`
` ......That's what I think."`
`I have no basis for it.`
` I don't have a clue how hurting Onee‐chan would be connected to that mysterious incident several years later.`
`But for some reason, I can't imagine that there is no connection.`
`A witch caused that incident.`
`And the culprit is the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`And {f:5:Beatrice} was part of the Mariage Sorcière Alliance of Witches.`
`I had horribly hurt the other witch of that alliance.`
`I had hurt her by saying that magic doesn't exist.`
`.........And that's why, several years later, an inexplicable crime by a witch occurred,`
` and that two‐day period which can't be explained with anything but magic was thrust in my face via a message bottle.`
`"......I'm sure that I'm not unrelated.`
` .........I don't know.`
` It could be chance, it could be fate.`
` .........For some reason, I've just started thinking that way on this journey."`
`"And your basis?"`
`"None.`
` It's just what I'm thinking."`
`"Hmmmm......`
` The Japanese sure are interesting.`
` Even if they're the victim, they feel as though they did something wrong, and apologize for no reason."`
`"......I could understand if you said "I hate {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama for stealing my family!" or something,`
` but you really are an odd one, feeling guilty for no reason and apologizing."`
`"Of course I hate {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I couldn't continue this journey without that feeling."`
`"But it's alright for me to find another purpose to this journey.`
` There's nothing wrong with me adding the goal of apologizing for past sins onto this journey for revenge on a witch of twelve years prior.`
` I can at least go to Rokkenjima, apologize for my reckless remarks, and offer flowers."`
`"......No, .........there's something better than flowers.`
` And I think that would be more fitting for Onee‐chan."`
`I stood up, and, ignoring my hair being blown about by the sea breeze, I concentrated my mind......`
`I lifted my palms up to the height of my head, ......and imagined a vast space......`
`"............Ange‐sama..............."`
`"......Quiet.`
` ........................"`
`"......Come, arise.`
` ......I am the witch apprentice, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}.`
` ......Though I was excommunicated, I was once a member of the same alliance, and you are dearly missed furniture who played with me.`
` Answer to my call........."`
`It was hard to tell in the middle of the day, but a faint blue light gathered around the palms of my hands.`
`.........Then,`
` .........I revived Sakutarou's form.`
`It truly was long‐missed, that figure.`
`His cute ears, his bright‐red scarf.`
`......It came off easily, so Onee‐chan faithfully re‐wrapped it all the time, didn't she...`
`"......Sakutaro......`
` ......Recognize us?`
` Do you know who we are...?"`
`‘...Uryu......?`
` Uryu......?`
` Mammon...?`
` Ange.........?’`
`With a sleepy face, as though waking up from a long slumber, Sakutarou looked all around him as he spoke.`
`"It's been a long time, ......Sakutarou.`
` I'm pretty sure this is the first time I've summoned you with my own power.`
` ......And now, I'm the only one who can."`
`‘..................Uryu......’`
`Those words might have been a bit cruel.`
`{n}Sakutarou's face clouded over...`
`"In the past, I denied you.`
` .........Now that I have summoned you,`
` ......that means that I have accepted your existence."`
`‘.........Is it okay......?`
` Is it okay...for me to be summoned into your world......?’`
`His eyes were slightly frightened.`
`......It was only natural.`
` I, who had played with him like a friend before,`
` had one day suddenly denied him and tried to burn him with the anti‐magic toxin.`
`It was only natural that he was scared......`
`"I apologize.`
` For that day.`
` .........To you too, Mammon.`
` And to the rest of you."`
`At some point, ......the rest of the Seven Sisters had gathered on the deck.`
`No, they are there at all times.`
` Always by my side.`
`As long as I accept that it's okay for them to be there, they will appear anytime.`
`"You certainly do exist.`
` Lucifer.`
` And Leviathan.`
` And Satan.`
` And Belphegor.`
` And Mammon.`
` And Beelzebub.`
` And Asmodeus.`
` ......And Sakutarou too."`
`"......Is that alright?`
` Ange‐sama, you are one who is challenging {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` ...Is it alright for one in a position of denying witches to accept us?"`
`"About whether magic exists or not in my world, sorry, but let me put that question on hold.`
` It's not like I myself have accepted the existence of magic."`
`"......Yet you accept us? How do you explain that contradiction?"`
`"Because magic exists for people who believe.`
` Even if I don't.`
` If someone believes, then magic will exist in that person's world."`
`"That will not be interfered with in any way, whether I believe in magic or not.`
` No, it must not be interfered with."`
`"That person just needs to hold their head up high and believe in their own magic.`
` And I will accept that.`
` So it isn't strange at all for you guys to exist."`
`".........That's quite the rationalization...but, an interesting interpretation, I would say."`
`"What you're saying, Ange‐sama, is probably a Devil's Proof."`
`"A Devil's Proof......?"`
`"After all!`
` To prove the existence of demons, you just need to bring one with you..."`
`"But denying the existence of demons is impossible!"`
`"Kyahha!`
` And we are here.`
` That means that whether Ange‐sama believes in magic or not, our existence is unshakable."`
`‘......Uryu?`
` The anti‐magic toxin...`
`.........is disappearing...`
`...from Ange......’`
`"Y‐you're right......`
` ......But she's in a position of denying magic......so why......?"`
`"That's probably......`
`......because I learned respect and acceptance.`
` Now, ......I might be able to understand...`
`...the depths of Maria onee‐chan's magic......and {f:5:Beatrice}'s."`
`In the past, I insisted that I didn't believe in things like magic,`
` that something like that couldn't exist—I acted like I had my eyes tightly shut and couldn't see anything.`
`But now I'm different.`
` I get the feeling I can look right at the thing called magic, and close in on its true nature......`
`"......How frustrating.`
` It's truly rare to find a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} so free of the anti‐magic toxin in this day and age.`
` And she has such an uncommon genius for being a witch..."`
`"That's right.`
` ......If Ange‐sama tried to become a witch now,`
` ......she could grow to be a Great Witch, maybe even at {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's level."`
`"Even so, she is our master, and has accepted our existence.`
` ......Most likely, Ange‐sama will be our final master.`
` Let us think of this as our final service, and apply ourselves to the fullest."`
`"......Bleghh.`
` I just can't sta~nd that Ange‐sama still doesn't believe in magic herself."`
`"......Ange‐samaaa, please believe in magic too~.`
` Feels like a waste to finally have a master and have it not be a wi~tch."`
`"Even though you have outstanding talent which could make you one of the greatest of witches, your goal is to slay them.`
` It's such a shame."`
`"......Well, that's her life, her way of living,`
` and if that's the way she's decided her world is going to be, there's nothing we can achieve by complaining."`
`"Thanks for understanding me.`
` Yeah, whether magic exists {i:to me} or not,`
` that's up to me to decide.`
` Whether magic actually does exist somewhere in the world or not, you see?"`
`When I think about it, the world is so vast, ......and yet so small.`
`Billions of people live on the Earth.`
`{n}But I probably won't meet even one percent of those people.`
`Even so, I will speak of the world.`
`{n}Without knowing even one percent of the world—I will speak of "my world".`
`"I'm not qualified to deny the laws of a world I don't know.`
` ......So just because magic doesn't exist in my world, I can't deny that magic exists in a world I don't know."`
`"That makes it a true Devil's Proof.`
` No, maybe it's more like "when in Rome, do as the Romans do"."`
`I can be confident in the world I know.`
` So even if my world {i:is} denied by a complete stranger who doesn't know a thing about it, that's nothing to worry about.`
`And in the same way, just because I don't know another world,`
` that doesn't make me qualified to deny it.`
`"Which is why,`
` regardless of whether there is magic in my world or not,`
` ......I cannot deny the magic Maria onee‐chan taught me."`
`‘Uryu!`
` After all, even if you've never seen it,`
` ......magic exists!’`
`"Yes.`
` That's why, as I've already said,`
` ......your existence, as friends of the Mariage Sorcière Alliance of Witches,`
` cannot be denied by me or anyone else."`
`I proclaimed the most important part again.`
`............Even though the sea breeze and the crashing of the waves were noisy, it was a time of silence.`
`Both Sakutarou and the Seven Sisters of Purgatory......reflected upon my words.`
`And, probably, I did too.`
`Does magic exist or not—`
`{n}Do witches exist or not—`
`I reflected on the fact that, while ignoring what the answer was within my world, ......I had declared openly that I would accept their existence, despite it being a contradiction.`
`‘Thank you, ......Ange.’`
`"If you will accept that much, perhaps one day, witches could also—`
` ...No, that was a foolish question.`
` You already have a clear answer to that question."`
`"Sorry.`
` I do accept that witches might exist somewhere in this world.`
` But {i:my} world will not waver."`
`"......You won't accept witches or magic.`
` You'll definitely expose the truth of Rokkenjima.`
` ......Right?"`
`"Yes.`
` That is my world.`
` Even if a witch really does exist, I won't accept her in my world.`
` No matter how much that witch tries to court me."`
`"Your position is to slay witches.`
` ......And I now understand well that you have not the slightest wavering in that feeling!"`
`"We are your furniture, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory...!`
` We will always be by your side.`
` We will always be waiting for the day that we can be useful...!"`
`"Although, since you don't believe in magic, we can never be anything more than someone to talk to."`
`"That's enough for now.`
` We've been left room to exist.`
` For that alone, we should thank and accept Ange‐sama."`
`"In short!`
` All of uuuuus..."`
`‘Can be together again......`
` Uryuu!!’`
`"Kyaaah!!`
` Sakutaroo!`
` Let me fluffle youuuuuuuuu~!!"`
`As Sakutarou was overcome with emotion and tears came to his eyes, the Seven Sisters closed in and mobbed him.`
`......They were also celebrating a long‐awaited reunion.`
`Because they were granted permission to exist, they can exist here without doubt.`
`No—they can exist even if I don't permit it.`
`Because I accepted them, they {i:showed} their reunion's joy {i:to me as well}.`
`As I watched over that scene, .........I reflected on the meaning of this journey of mine.`
`".........I wonder if everyone will forgive me this way."`
`"You've done enough.`
` We are furniture.`
` Just being summoned,`
` just being allowed to be by your side makes us happy."`
`‘Uryu...!`
` Ange, thank you very much......!’`
`"......Come to think of it, why was I able to summon Sakutarou?`
` ......No, it's the other way around.`
` Why wasn't Onee‐chan able to summon Sakutarou?"`
`Maria onee‐chan had despaired, thinking that Sakutarou had died.`
`Which told me that she hadn't been able to summon him like this anymore.`
`In the past, Onee‐chan said it was more advantageous in a summoning to have a vessel.`
`However, a vessel is like training wheels, and it shouldn't be absolutely necessary.`
`......In other words, even if the stuffed animal lion that was Sakutarou's vessel didn't exist, it should have been possible to summon him.`
`......In fact, for that matter,`
` it's a little doubtful whether summoned beings even have the concept of life and death.`
`Moreover, Sakutarou was an especially important friend to Maria onee‐chan.`
`She should have been able to strive hard to summon him one more time.`
`It certainly was sad that the original stuffed animal vessel had been torn apart,`
` but why was he "dead", and why couldn't she summon him again......?`
`‘...That's because...`
`at that time, Maria saw my stuffed animal get torn,`
` and she {i:decided}`
` that I had died.’`
`"It's the same as the existence of magic.`
` ......If, in Lady {f:5:Maria}'s world, it becomes a fact that Sakutarou died,`
` then Sakutarou cannot exist in her world."`
`‘............Uryu......’`
`The shock of having her beloved stuffed animal torn apart...`
`had left a wound in her heart serious enough to prevent her from ever again summoning her irreplaceable close friend.`
`{i:In Maria onee‐chan's eyes}, Sakutarou had died.`
`So even if Sakutarou could exist like this to me, he could not exist before her.`
`‘I......was always together with Maria......`
` ......As she cried, I was there the whole time right beside her, telling her not to cry......`
` ......But my form, my voice, ......nothing of me would reach her......’`
`Sakutarou hung his head, looking sad.`
`"......After that incident, the nature of Mariage Sorcière rapidly began to change.`
` Before then, the alliance was a peaceful thing."`
`"But after the incident, it grew full of shadier things, focusing on how to curse people you hate.`
` ......Onee‐chan's diary began to show a clear change."`
`A diary is a mirror that reflects one's heart as it is.`
`It probably showed the personality called Maria die,`
` and be reborn as the evil witch personality {f:5:Maria}.`
`As she filled the diary with hatred and sadness, ......her heart surely was not fulfilled.`
`Because she wasn't fulfilled, she had no choice but to fill it with hatred and sadness.`
`And while still unfulfilled, she met with death.`
`......I wonder if her unfulfilled soul has a hole opened in its chest from sadness even now,`
` and continually wanders, tears dripping down and calling Sakutarou's name......`
`.................................`
`"...............You......are needed by Onee‐chan."`
`‘Uryu.........’`
`"What can I do to revive you in Maria onee‐chan's world?`
` If I can learn how to do that, I'll be able to save Onee‐chan.`
` ......That is the method of atonement I am tasked with.`
` What can be done to revive you?"`
`‘......My vessel had a very important meaning to Maria......’`
`"The vessel.`
` ......So, if we could revive the lion stuffed animal..."`
`‘But......`
` ......Mama Rosa made my stuffed animal herself, so only Mama Rosa can make it......’`
`Even inside the diary, Maria onee‐chan had asked this of {f:5:Beatrice}, and had been refused for the same reason.`
`The magical significance of a stuffed animal being unique and handmade is very large.`
`Then, if we could make the same thing once more......`
`But Aunt Rosa is already gone from this world.`
`{n}We can never make the same thing again.`
`"......Was there ever another identical stuffed animal made, or anything like that?"`
`"He is a stuffed animal made for Lady {f:5:Maria}'s birthday present, and is the only one in the world.`
` ......A handmade and unique vessel.`
` That's why it conceals a great magical power."`
`"And......if lost, it will never be obtained again.`
` It will not revive..."`
`‘.........Uryu.........’`
`......Maria onee‐chan knew that,`
` so when she saw that stuffed animal, unique in the world, be torn apart,`
` .........she despaired.`
`Because it was a stuffed animal unique in the world,`
` and it permitted her no compromises such as simply buying another, ......she despaired from the bottom of her heart......`
`"......But Sakutarou is right here.`
` Even without a vessel, he's here.`
` I accept that, and so he firmly exists in my world."`
`".........Even if Maria onee‐chan doesn't accept him, that fact cannot be denied.`
` Right...?"`
`"Logically, that's true,`
` ......but I think using the same logic to make Lady {f:5:Maria} accept him could be difficult."`
`‘......Maria.........`
` ......I'm not dead...`
` I'm right here.........`
` ......Uryu......’`
`"I'm sure that on Rokkenjima,`
` ......I'll be able to be reunited with Maria onee‐chan.`
` And, ......no matter what, I'm going to revive you inside Onee‐chan, and let you be reunited too."`
`‘Can you do that......?’`
`"It will probably be hard.`
` ......Just like how, after being invited into the witches' alliance, I rejected it without understanding what it meant,`
` she might also reject your existence."`
`".........But I've got to do it.`
` That's the only way I can atone for my sins."`
`"............Ange‐sama......"`
`"What is waiting on Rokkenjima?`
` And what will happen, what will I be able to achieve?`
` ......Although maybe nothing will happen at all."`
`‘........................’`
`"That island, which was the beginning of everything, will be the final destination of this journey.`
` .........As your master, I must bring all of you witch's furniture with me...`
`...and {i:I must return} to the witch's island—to Rokkenjima."`
`Even though the rays of the sun had been so strong, at some point clouds had started to hang over us.`
`The spray hitting my cheek might not all be coming from the crashing waves.`
`"Ange‐san.`
` It looks like a light shower is coming.`
` Shouldn't you be going down?"`
`Amakusa called out to me, with an expression of surprise that I was still here.`
`When I looked up, I saw that the island's silhouette had gotten much larger.`
`{n}We might reach land very soon.`
`I remembered that the weather report had mentioned scattered rains.`
`The sky wasn't dark enough for rain clouds.`
`{n}It'll probably be just for a short time.`
`Even if the rain was light enough not to be a bother,`
` ......having rain start to fall as we approached the island felt like some kind of fate.`
`It was probably raining on October 4th, 1986, as well.`
`{n}I was approaching the Rokkenjima of that day, ......and not just in distance......`
`I went back down with Amakusa.`
`Amakusa was carrying what looked like a quite large and heavy golf bag.`
`It was something Amakusa had brought back from god‐knows‐where after we split up for a day.`
`{n}......I wasn't going to inquire as to its contents, but it's hard to imagine that they're anything peaceful.`
`".........I'm deliberately not going to ask what's inside, but it looks heavy."`
`"Why is it that these are so heavy?`
` A French instructor taught me something interesting about that once."`
`"He said that they {i:should} be heavy.`
` .........After all, a human life is heavier than the Earth.`
` So these should be even heavier."`
`".........It'll be nice if you don't have a chance to use them."`
`"That would be nice."`
`Amakusa set the golf‐bag‐like luggage down heavily beside him.`
`A two‐propeller aircraft touched down on the runway.`
`{n}With the weather in these conditions, it could not have been a pleasant flight.`
`{n}Everything after this flight had been suspended due to the weather.`
`Cutting through the drizzle as she traversed the runway, Sumadera Kasumi entered the lobby with two black‐suits as guards.`
`The four black‐suits who had been waiting inside the lobby stood up and respectfully lowered their heads.`
`"""Kasumi‐sama...!"""`
`"Propeller planes do shake awfully, don't they......`
` I never want to fly in one again."`
`"We have a car prepared!`
` Please, this way."`
`They went into two luxury cars that had been rented...`
`"......Ange should be heading for Rokkenjima.`
` A deserted island—how truly convenient.`
` .........You have prepared the tools, I hope?"`
`"Yes, ma'am......!"`
`The black‐suit in the passenger seat lifted a heavy bag that had been by his feet onto his lap,`
` opened the zipper wide, and showed Kasumi the contents.`
`Inside were several blocky objects wrapped tightly in silver aluminum foil.`
`......He peeled one open to show her.`
`Out peeked a black, blunt, automatic pistol......`
`It was already approaching ten at night.`
`{n}The typhoon had already engulfed Rokkenjima.`
`Even the rose garden that had looked so beautiful during the day...`
`was now being beaten down upon by the fierce winds and resisting with all its might, undulating and trying to keep the flowers from blowing away...`
`Heading for the guesthouse through that rose garden, led by Shannon, were Battler, who was holding up an umbrella; Jessica; and Maria, who was sleeping on George's shoulder.`
`"It's just to the guesthouse, we could make it there on our own...`
` Shannon‐chan, it's OK, go back and rest."`
`"Oh, no, accompanying you is also my duty..."`
`"The family conference is going on inside, and my mom and Genji‐san are on edge, that's the thing.`
` If we're too considerate to her, they'll get the wrong idea and think she's slacking off."`
`"That's right.`
` Just graciously accepting her offer will actually cause her less trouble.`
` ...Thanks, Shannon."`
`"Not at all.`
` ......Certainly, as Milady says, it is very tense inside the mansion today.`
` Coming with all of you has allowed me a breath of fresh air, and taken some of the stress off me."`
`"The family conference, huh.`
` .........They went to all the trouble of chasing us kids out, so they're probably having a pretty damn nasty discussion."`
`"Probably.`
` I'm sure there's nothing we can do to help out.`
` Just making sure to stay out of their way is the best way for us to be useful, I think."`
`"Feh......!`
` You can bet your ass they're just going on about money money money again."`
`"...They act like they're so rich most of the time, but when it comes down to handing out cash, they start hemming and hawing.`
` Why can't they just be generous and split it evenly between everyone?"`
`"Ihihi.`
` That'd be awesome.`
` It'd be great if I got a share too.`
` 'Cause if I got some as well, I'd split it with Shannon‐chan right away."`
`"Th‐thank you very much...`
` That's alright, but I appreciate the offer."`
`"You aren't materialistic at all, are you, Shannon?`
` Normally, girls of your age have plenty of things they want to buy."`
`"Yes.`
` But none of the things I want can be bought with money."`
`"Ooh!`
` So ungreedy!`
` If you lined up all the things I wanted, all the gold in the world wouldn't be enough."`
`"Nothing you can {i:buy}, she said.`
` I wonder what these "things that can't be bought" that Shannon wants a~re.`
` Any idea, George nii‐san?"`
`"W‐well, I wonder.`
` I guess only Shannon would know."`
`"I, ...I don't know either."`
`George and Shannon looked down with their faces red.`
`Battler had also heard the details, so he knew what Jessica was teasing them about.`
`"George‐aniki is someone even I can respect.`
` I think you've met a really great person, Shannon‐chan."`
`"Yeah.`
` I can rest easy knowing Shannon is in good hands."`
`"St‐stop teasing.`
` It's a serious issue for us.`
` More importantly, what about you, Jessica‐chan?`
` Have you been able to get a little closer to Kanon‐kun?"`
`"Whaaaaaaaaat?!`
` So, you and Kanon‐kun are like that?!"`
`"Ah, um, mgh!!`
` Th‐that's dirty, George nii‐san, twisting the conversation around like that is just mean!"`
`As they had an animated discussion with ups and downs,`
` the four kids headed for the guesthouse.......`
`The annual family conference was extremely important to the Ushiromiya family,`
` and this year in particular seemed like it was going to be especially so.`
`Apparently, the family head, Kinzo, was personally going to be making a very serious announcement,`
` and everyone other than the adults had been strictly ordered to leave the mansion.`
`Battler hadn't attended the family conference in six years, so he hadn't really noticed,`
` but according to Jessica, there seemed to be a very tense atmosphere tonight,`
` completely different from a normal year.`
`......Common sense made it clear that Kinzo, whose remaining life was short,`
` was going to make some big announcement about the succession of the head and the distribution of his fortune......`
`"I'm surprised.`
` .........To think that Grandfather is actually going to make an appearance......"`
`"......I see.`
` So this is the witch's counterattack."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` I wanted to leave the Joker called Kinzo face‐down a little longer, but it is probably about time to turn it over.`
` Trump cards exist to be used.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Damn.`
` So my theory that Grandfather was dead since the beginning, and a mysterious 18th person had snuck in in his place...`
`...is now suddenly torn apart."`
`"I had foreseen that you would begin to doubt Kinzo eventually...!`
` Come on, come on, your reasoning is back to square one once again, you know?"`
`"With this, your theory that Kinzo was dead at the very beginning and I was hiding as the 18th person goes poof!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`".........Goddammit...`
` But no way I'll lose heart.`
` That's only one theory gone.`
` I'll attack you like a storm, like a tornado......"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` I would have it no other way!`
` Even the first twilight has not yet begun.`
` It is far too early to give up."`
`"That's right.`
` And it's not like it was denied with the red truth.`
` .........At this point in time, Battler's theory hasn't been defeated.`
` It's too early to say that you've won."`
`"Hmm, you're right.`
` ......It {i:is} still too early for me to simply swallow her story.`
` ...Grandfather is supposed to be finally appearing,`
` but there's also a chance that there'll be a lot of talk about how his health has gotten worse and he won't appear after all."`
`"......Uncle Krauss might simply be trying desperately...`
`to hide the fact that Grandfather really is dead until the last second."`
`"Ha...!`
` I see, I see, you could also think of it that way.`
` Do as you please.`
` It will be resolved soon.`
` Very soon...`
` *cackle*cackle*......!"`
`All of the relatives and Nanjo could be seen in the dining hall.`
`Nanjo sat alone, quietly watching the wind and rain outside.`
`Krauss was sitting in the seat of his own rank, with Natsuhi standing motionlessly at his side.`
`All the other siblings and their partners were gathered at the opposite end of the long table, whispering to each other......`
`"......Is that true?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......Maria said...the person who gave her the umbrella...`
`...was Father."`
`"Son of a gun...`
` Then that means the foundation of our strategy has collapsed...!"`
`"Not just our strategy.`
` Since Father is healthy and has said that he will make an announcement himself, our trivial bargaining with Nii‐san was completely pointless."`
`"Yup.`
` ......That old bastard.`
` Why couldn't he have just shown himself right away instead of dragging it out?`
` Thanks to that, we've just been quarreling with Aniki uselessly."`
`"............Maybe that's what he wanted to test?`
` Maybe it's not my place to say it, since we aren't related by blood, but your father is very intelligent, you realize?"`
`"Our exchange during the day was probably being listened in on by one of the servants, and reported to Father.`
` .........Incredible.`
` The fact that we're clamoring after Father's inheritance is now clear as day to him...`
` .........Ah, just incredible..."`
`Eva held her head, uncharacteristically dejected.`
`If, as Kyrie had said, this had been Kinzo's design from the beginning—`
`a huge setup spread over more than a year in a bid to find the siblings' true natures—`
`then they had fallen for it completely...`
`"......We still don't know for sure that it's reached Father's ears."`
`"No, it definitely has!`
` ......And everyone but Nii‐san claimed that he was dead, and none of us believed in his good health...!"`
`"Aaah, we're done for.......`
` ......He'll make an announcement.`
` He'll say that Nii‐san will become the successor, and that we aren't even qualified to wear the One‐winged Eagle......`
` ......Ahhh, I............"`
`"Nee‐san...... Don't give up......"`
`"......Rosa‐san.`
` I wonder whether Maria‐chan really did receive that umbrella from Father?"`
`"Huh?`
` What do you mean......?"`
`"......{i:Maria‐chan} might have met Father.`
` But {i:we} haven't.`
` Maria‐chan only claims to have met him."`
`"What......?`
` ......Are you saying that Maria is telling a lie?!"`
`"Calm down, Rosa.`
` ......We're not calling Maria‐chan a liar.`
` But she's the kind of kid who accepts what people tell her, right?"`
`"......For example, if, say, Genji‐san came up to her and said something like "I was told by your grandfather to hand this to you, Maria‐sama",`
` then even if Maria‐chan hadn't met Dad, she still might say that she got an umbrella from him, right?"`
`"Th‐......that's right.`
` That could be the trick...!"`
`"But what Maria‐chan said was this, right?`
` "Grandfather came and handed me an umbrella"."`
`"Yes, it was.`
` She was clear that she received the umbrella directly from her grandfather."`
`"......Directly, huh?`
` Well, that's that, then."`
`"...........................`
` Whoever said that the thinking of the incompetent can pass for sleeping was absolutely right.`
` If you think about it a bit, all this about the umbrella is irrelevant."`
`"Why?`
` Maria‐chan could have been bribed by Nii‐san to lie and say something that made it seem like Father was in good health, couldn't she?!`
` There is no evidence that Father actually handed the umbrella to her...!"`
`"No matter who Maria‐chan received the umbrella from,`
` or even if she never was given an umbrella in the first place,`
` Father will appear very soon.`
` With Father in front of us, the question of the umbrella will be completely irrelevant."`
`".........In other words, the only time that the umbrella question comes into play is the other case."`
`"What do you mean, the other case?"`
`"............Ah, ...I got it.`
` ......This is probably what Kyrie‐san's sayin'."`
`".........We're bein' told that Father is comin' here any moment,`
` but there's still a chance of some excuse why he won't turn up in the end, right......?"`
`"I, .........I see.`
` That's true..."`
`"Maybe Nii‐san just said Father was going to appear off the top of his head, in a desperate bid to buy time against our investigation.`
` Father really has passed away already,`
` and Nii‐san is still lying and saying he's in good health...!"`
`"In short, if Father appears, then no schemes will be effective.`
` There's no need to even think about it.`
` We're fish on the chopping board.`
` We'd have no choice but to leave fate to the heavens and face direct negotiations with Father.`
` No choice but to beg for money, in the expectation that we'll need to prostrate ourselves and be subjected to his fists."`
`"......But on the other hand, if Father doesn't appear, then our original strategy isn't hampered in the least."`
`".........I see.`
` Then, no matter which way it goes, there's absolutely no need to get flustered now."`
`"That's it.`
` If Father shows up, it simply means that the family conference will be carried out as normal.`
` .........If he doesn't, we just have to continue to press Krauss nii‐san."`
`"He might start off sayin', Father's mood has suddenly gotten worse and...`
` We gotta make absolutely sure not to let Krauss‐san talk his way out of it."`
`"......It seems what we should really be trying to figure out...`
`is what scheme Nii‐san is going to try to use to buy himself some time.`
` I know better than anyone just how far he'll go to refuse to admit defeat."`
`"If Father is well, ......then we prostrate ourselves and beg for money.`
` ......If it's Krauss nii‐san's farce, then we continue our ugly sibling fight.`
` .........Seems like this year's family conference is going to be as wonderful as ever."`
`"Yep.`
` The thinking of the incompetent can pass for sleeping, then.`
` It's almost ten.`
` ......Should we press Aniki?"`
`Rudolf and the rest looked at Krauss.`
`Firmly seated, he looked like he was awaiting Kinzo's arrival with an air of composure.`
`......They couldn't tell whether that really was composure, or whether he was scheming about how to tie together his lie.`
`"............Dear......"`
`"......Calm yourself.`
` Making a fuss here won't achieve anything.`
` .........Let's leave it to Genji‐san."`
`"It's almost......ten o'clock, isn't it."`
`That was the time that had been set for tonight's family conference to open.`
`And in addition, it was also the time that the Ushiromiya family head needed to appear......`
`Right then, they heard the sound of footsteps approaching from the hall.`
`{n}There were multiple sets.`
`Natsuhi jerked her head up with a start......`
`But there came the sound of a knock, and her expression filled with disappointment.`
`Because Kinzo probably wouldn't have knocked.`
`"......Please excuse us.`
` We have finished closing up the mansion for the night."`
`It was Gohda and Kumasawa.`
`Unlike the physically fit Gohda,`
` it was rare for Kumasawa with her old body to still be tasked with work this late.`
`Of course, Krauss also seemed to know that.`
`"Mmhm.`
` Good work.`
` .........My apologies for making you work at such a time, Kumasawa‐san."`
`"Oh, not at all.`
` I may not look it, but staying up late is still one of my specialties.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho...!"`
`"......Could we not at least relieve Kumasawa of the duty of being an observer?`
` It really will be difficult on her body, I imagine."`
`"............The order was to gather all of the servants as well.`
` I cannot disobey."`
`Tonight's family conference was clearly different from a normal one.`
`On a normal year, no one was able to attend the family conference except relatives.`
`{n}It would have been inconceivable for any servants to be present.`
`But this year was different.`
`They had been told to have all of the servants in attendance for the family conference.`
`{n}Of course, they would not be allowed to speak.`
` .........They were there as observers.`
`Just what in the world was going to happen that needed five servants to observe?`
`......Even Krauss didn't know.`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` Believe it or not, I'm good at pulling all‐nighters.`
` If you stuff yourself with mackerel too, Krauss‐sama, you'll be able to keep going all night as well."`
`"Hahahaha.`
` I see, so there's energy in you yet.`
` No doubt you'll still be working with such energy when you're past a hundred."`
`"Madam.`
` Forgive my presumption, but I have prepared a light snack.`
` It is ready to be served at any time—just give the word."`
`"Thank you.`
` You really are considerate.`
` ......Please ask our guests whether they would care for some more coffee."`
`"Certainly."`
`After bowing slightly, Gohda took the pot towards the relatives gathered at the other end of the table.`
`As he did, more footsteps approached from the hallway.`
`......A single set.`
` They were light.`
`Even before the knock, they could imagine who it was.`
`"Excuse me......`
` I have taken the children to the guesthouse."`
`"Good work.`
` Tonight is a special evening.`
` Make sure you stay alert."`
`"Ye‐yes.`
` Certainly, Madam......"`
`Genji, accompanied by Kanon, had gone to meet Kinzo.`
`{n}......There was still no sign of their return.`
`The hands of the clock were creeping past ten.`
`{n}Once sure of that, Eva spoke to Krauss.`
`"......Nii‐saaan?`
` It's time.`
` Is the family conference still not going to start?"`
`"............The arrival of the guest of honor has been delayed.`
` Wait a short while."`
`"How long?`
` Sorry, but I'm setting a time limit on this.`
` I won't have you saying "Father hasn't quite shown up yet" over and over until dawn."`
`"How can {i:I} make a promise about the time {i:Father} will show up?`
` Why are you in such a rush?`
` Why not drink some coffee and calm down for now...?"`
`"Aniki, we're gathered here for a family conference.`
` Not a farce.`
` We'll wait thirty more minutes.`
` But if that gets us nothing, we're barging into the study."`
`"B‐barging into......`
` That would be an action quite lacking in respect for the head!"`
`"It would, wouldn't it? Sorry about that.`
` We'll sit tight for thirty more minutes.`
` Hehheheheh......"`
`".....................Heh."`
`"...........................`
` I look forward to seeing whether you can keep that same smile thirty minutes from now."`
`"......You honestly believe that Father is dead?"`
`"I have no desire to discuss that at this point.`
` We just have to wait until Father comes here.`
` There's absolutely no need for me to argue you down, Nii‐san."`
`"The Ushiromiya headship will be passed on to the proper person in the proper manner.`
` ......No matter what you may scheme, you cannot go against this.`
` Of course, the same goes for me."`
`"What are you on about?`
` ......You've been bragging all these years about being the successor to the head yourself...!"`
`"Allow me to turn your words straight back on you.`
` I have no desire to discuss that at this point.`
` Father merely has to come here and proclaim it with his own mouth.`
` It is completely unnecessary for me to argue you down.`
` ......Right?`
` Heheheh!"`
`Krauss casually turned Eva's words back on her.`
`{n}Of course, that poured fuel on Eva's anger.`
`{n}But it didn't ignite.`
`Because in that instant, the sound of a very loud knock rang out.`
`Both Genji and Kanon were usually very reserved when they knocked.`
`{n}They wouldn't hit the door with such a violent strength.`
`......It was like a judge's gavel slamming down in a call to order.`
`So everyone fell quiet......`
`The door opened slightly, ......and Genji showed himself.`
`Then, he spoke with a solemn tone different from his usual one.`
`{n}It wasn't the tone he used when carrying out his duties.`
`{n}......It was the tone he used when speaking for Kinzo himself.`
`So just by hearing Genji speak like that, the siblings were struck with a sudden tension.`
`"Take your seats, everyone."`
`At those words, the dining hall fell into complete silence, and everyone rushed back to their designated seats.`
`They were like students who had been making a lot of noise just before homeroom, hurriedly returning to their seats when the teacher came;`
` it might even have felt humorous.`
`......But there was no way anyone would joke about it.`
`Everyone sat in order, and Shannon, Gohda, and Kumasawa stood up straight in a row by the wall.`
`"......The head of the glorious Ushiromiya family, and lord of Rokkenjima, the island that sparkles gold.`
` Lord Ushiromiya Kinzo is present."`
`Of the double doors into the dining hall, Genji opened the right door from the inside, and Kanon opened the left door from the outside.`
`......And, welcomed by the deepest of bows from the two servants, with his cape fluttering majestically, ............Kinzo appeared......`
`Kinzo's gait had a dignified weight to it, and it was very hard to believe that he had been diagnosed as having not much time left to live.`
`Genji pulled back Kinzo's seat, and motioned for him to sit.`
`But Kinzo remained standing, signaling with his chin for Genji to move back.`
`"Hhheheheheheheheh, fuhha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!`
` Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to Rokkenjima.`
` Why the frightened face, Evaa?"`
`"N‐no, why would I be frightened...!`
` I, I'm just relieved to find you in excellent spirits, Father......"`
`"Wahahahaha...!!`
` Evaa, you're as interesting as ever, aren't yoou?`
` You might try honestly saying how frustrated you are at losing your bet with Krauss.`
` ......Heheh{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah, you can't say it, can youuu?`
` Hehuhuha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah!!"`
`Eva realized that their conversation during the day had indeed been an open book to Kinzo, and she turned red as she hung her head.`
`"Well then, my sons, daughters, and their companions!`
` Tonight, I shall make an important announcement regarding those things that you all have your hearts set upon: my fortune and the succession of the headship."`
`"But first!`
` I think I will mention how incredibly disappointed I am.`
` I refer to the fact that, to this very day, not a single one of you has been able to solve the riddle of the epitaph."`
`Even though Kinzo said he was disappointed,`
` a condescending smile, as though there was no way the likes of them could have solved it, rose to his face as he cast an eye over each and every one of them.`
`".........I had been planning on handing over everything to the person who could solve it.`
` But here we stand today, not a single person having been capable, and not a single person having succeeded to all that is mine."`
`"Shameful...!!`
` The fact that not one among you has come forward with the qualifications to succeed me,`
` I find truly disappointing, and shameful, and pathetic!!`
` Wah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"`
`The siblings hung their heads in silence.`
`Of course, they would have solved it if they could.`
` They had blown their chance, and none of them could deny that, but even so, it was just so hard a riddle...`
`"Therefore.`
` I am proclaiming here and now that I will suspend the use of the epitaph's riddle as a method of choosing my successor."`
`"In short, time's up!`
` This is game over.`
` ......What a shame for all of you.`
` You all had an equal and fair chance, and that has now collapsed!`
` .........Mwwhhuhuhahah!!"`
`It truly sounded like Kinzo was making a victory proclamation.`
`"In that case, will the headship be succeeded by my oldest son, Krauss...?`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` The answer is <no>!!"`
`"Wha...?!"`
`"....................."`
`"......I am sure you understand why, Krauss?`
` I certainly did give you the title of successor.`
` But you did nothing with it but get drunk on it...`
` Do you know what it means to be the successor......?"`
`".........It means...to be the one who will succeed you, Father..."`
`"WROOOOOOONNNNNNGGGGG!!`
` The successor isn't something that's guaranteed by the current head at aaaaaall!"`
`".........Listen up, Krauss.`
` I'll only teach you this once, so unplug your ears and listen.`
` The "successor", see,`
` is what you call someone who finds everyone else who's after the headship,`
` thoroughly breaks their noses, and makes it so that they can never disobey him again."`
`"This is not only something that can be said of the headship.`
` It can also be said of money!`
` A "rich person" doesn't mean someone who has money.`
` It means someone who crushes everyone who has more money than himself,`
` and who scrabbles together more money than anyone else."`
`"It's the same with talent.`
` A "genius" is not what you call a person blessed with talent!`
` It means a person who crushes everyone with more talent than themselves!`
` A person who can coerce all other people to call them that by using their strength and charisma!!"`
`"You have a mistaken impression when it comes to all of these things.`
` ......So you aren't of the right caliber to be my successor.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"...............N‐now I have learned..."`
`Perhaps that was precisely Kinzo's philosophy.`
`Though it could also be taken for a rant, it was as a result of faithfully carrying out that philosophy of his...`
`that Kinzo had raised the Ushiromiya family to such prosperous heights......`
`It may be hard to imagine after his immersion in the occult in recent years,`
` but it was that brutal aggressiveness that was Ushiromiya Kinzo's charisma and aura...`
`"Such a weak‐minded person has no qualification to inherit everything of the Ushiromiya family.`
` In that case, is Eva, Rudolf, or Rosa qualified?"`
`"That is also <no>!!`
` You were not able to solve the riddle, and neither were you able to scheme to drag Krauss down from his throne!`
` All the three of you could manage to do was put together a united front to try to extort money from Krauss."`
`"And even that scheme was thoughtless!`
` You can't even corner Krauss all by himself!`
` .........There could be nothing more shameful!"`
`"You lack the avarice to steal away the position of successor by any means necessary!!`
` In order to get what you want, you should pay all sacrifices, be covetous, avaricious to the last...!!`
` Fortune smiles upon the greedy!!"`
`"You three, who lack that wild spirit, are as unfit for the succession as Krauss!!"`
`Eva and the rest had no words to respond with.`
` And they couldn't figure out what it was that Kinzo was about to say...`
`Was Kinzo actually planning to proclaim that no one would succeed the head?`
`If so, that would work to Eva, Rosa, and Rudolf's advantage.`
`Because the only thing the siblings would ultimately need to do is coordinate everything between them after Kinzo's death, and split the inheritance evenly.`
`On the contrary, if a specific person's name was raised and proclaimed to be the one to succeed the head, that would surely be {i:more} troublesome.`
`......But would Kinzo really say something that would benefit any of the four siblings after lambasting them so much?`
`"......You don't think...he's going to say that because no one will succeed him,`
` he'll donate all of his fortune to charity or something, right......?"`
`".........I'm afraid I wouldn't put it past Father."`
`"The blood's just risen to his head......`
` For the time being, we're just gonna have to hear him out."`
`"W‐...well then, Father.`
` What thoughts do you have regarding the next head?"`
`"Hmph.........`
` Since I am so completely disappointed in all of you, I've lost the desire to hand it over to anyone.`
` Therefore, the Ushiromiya family will end here.`
` It ends with my generation."`
`"......S‐surely we must......"`
`"The Ushiromiya family was ruined long ago in that earthquake.`
` The current Ushiromiya family is nothing but my own short‐lived vision of gold.`
` ......The likes of which will end when I awaken from my slumber."`
`"Hehheheh!`
` This world is naught but a dream, an illusion.`
` ...Life is but a daydream before the awakening called death."`
`"Aaah, yes, and so it has been since the beginning!!`
` That I should lose everything when I die was {f:5:Beatrice}'s contract, and her curse!`
` Fuhhahhahha!!`
` You think that will work, {f:5:Beatrice}?!"`
`"I will be the one to capture you!!`
` Tonight, that shall become reality.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"`
`For a while, Kinzo was overcome with cackling, and his eyes bulged.`
`Whenever he talked about {f:5:Beatrice}, he was always eloquent, and filled with obsession......`
`"Foolish sons and daughters such as yourselves were truly a daydream!!`
` It is as though you were never there from the beginning!!"`
`"Disappear! Wake up!!`
` Fade away along with the doze of my true self...!!`
` You failures that have not built up anything that makes you worthy to succeed me!!"`
`"K‐Kinzo‐san.`
` If I may......"`
`"What is it?`
` My friend."`
`Nanjo nervously raised his hand, asking to speak.`
`{n}Kinzo permitted it.`
`"I understand how you feel, Kinzo‐san.`
` Because you love your children,`
` you expect a lot of them, and as a parent and grandparent myself,`
` I understand the parental affection that can make you feel as though these expectations were betrayed."`
`"......However, you are extraordinary, Kinzo‐san.`
` A genius.`
` Isn't it a little too harsh to say that it's only natural for them to catch up to you...?"`
`"And even so, that has not stopped them from trying—`
`Krauss‐san, Eva‐san, Rudolf‐san, Rosa‐san, and all of their partners, are doing their very best to catch up..."`
`"Hohoooooooooohhh???`
` And just how much money have they built up with this "doing their very best"?`
` These half‐wits, who fail in each and every one of their enterprises and become burdened with debt,`
` and still try to sponge off me, are "doing their very best" exactly howwww...?!?!"`
`"Money is the crystallization of everything in this world.`
` If you cannot grasp that, then you cannot grasp the world!`
` If a soul cannot keep a tight grasp on this world, it doesn't deserve to live!!`
` Disappear!!`
` Begone from my life and reality!!"`
`"......That argument is unreasonable.`
` With that logic, even I would not be allowed to live."`
`"......And yet I believe the time I spent playing chess with you was worthwhile for both of us...`
` ......You should know better than anyone else that there are many things in this world that money cannot buy."`
`".........mgh.`
` ......Hmm."`
`As the siblings motionlessly hung their heads, they cheered Nanjo on inside their hearts.`
`Not one of the siblings could offer their opinion to Kinzo in a rage, but Nanjo alone was allowed to, as Kinzo's close friend...`
`Even though Kinzo had raged so fiercely, after being admonished by Nanjo, he nodded several times as though in agreement.`
`......His surprisingly docile side might have seemed cute, but there was no one who could laugh.`
`"It may be true that your children weren't able to build up as great a fortune as yourself.`
` ......Well, even so, from my point of view, they're rich enough to make me jealous."`
`"But besides money, they have also built up a great many things that money can't buy.`
` When it comes to that, they are in no way inferior to you."`
`"Hoh.`
` And what are you saying they have built up that money cannot buy?"`
`"Happiness.`
` Family.`
` ......They have found wonderful partners, had children, and built up their own happy homes.`
` Your family is thriving thanks to them, and they have brought back grandchildren for you."`
`"Grandchildren are good.`
` We older people can look at those young grandchildren, who will live on into a new era that we will not be given a chance to see, and we can imagine endless futures for them.`
` ......Isn't that the sole entertainment for old age?"`
`"Remember, Kinzo‐san.`
` Remember your joy when they first came back to you with grandchildren...!`
` Your children, and your grandchildren, will relate your great works to future generations, and they will model themselves after you.`
` That is something that a single person cannot accomplish no matter how much money they have."`
`The siblings all nodded in agreement...`
`Certainly, there had been a time when Kinzo had looked at his newly born grandchildren with happiness in his eyes.`
`......Back when he still had some sanity in his heart.`
`......However, was there any {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} warmth still left inside Kinzo's heart......?`
`"You mean to say.`
` That in exchange for the vast riches I created!`
` Instead of gaining money, I have gained my grandchildren."`
`"N‐no, no, that's not what I—"`
`"So, in exchange for the several tens of billions in wealth that I have amassed, I have gained a single grandchild from each of my children!!"`
`"Hahhahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` This is wonderful!`
` So, I have created a single life at a cost of ten billion yen!`
` That's how it is!`
` Interesting, thinking of it from the perspective of alchemy truly makes for an interesting analogy, don't you agree...?!"`
`"Hohhh, what valuable grandchildren!`
` Wonderful, ......wonderful!!`
` Wah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!`
` Is that right, Krauss?`
` ......Is your daughter worth ten billion......?"`
`"..........................."`
`Krauss couldn't answer instantly.`
` ......It wasn't that he didn't have confidence in his daughter; it was because he didn't have a clue what Kinzo was trying to test with this question.`
`But when Natsuhi was then pressed for an answer, she responded, breaking Krauss's silence with an answer of her own interpretation.`
`"......Y‐yes.`
` Jessica is a daughter who I wouldn't let go of even for ten billion yen.`
` In that sense, I believe she has a value that can't be counted with money."`
`"Hoh.`
` So you can state for certain that she is worth ten billion.`
` Hohoh!`
` What about you, Eva?`
` What do you say about your George......?"`
`Given the way Natsuhi had chosen to answer, there was naturally no doubt as to what Eva's answer would be.`
`......Even though Eva should have known better than to respond to this kind of provocative question, she did so as well.`
`"Yes, Father.`
` George is worth ten billion, ......no, even more than that."`
`"And that's not in the abstract sense of things money can't buy.`
` George will certainly build up a fortune equal to his worth.`
` I am sure he will become a grandson worthy of carrying on your great works...!"`
`Eva sent a glance at Hideyoshi and Natsuhi that said "Like a fiddle".`
`......After hearing Eva's answer, Natsuhi was about to add more praise for her daughter, but stopped at a glare from Krauss.`
`"Hmm, I see.`
` .........Then what about you, Rudolf?`
` What about your Battler?"`
`"Compared to George‐kun, ......there's nothing about Battler I can brag about.`
` If he was kidnapped and we were threatened with a ransom of ten billion, I'd feel like sticking a bow on the guy and letting them have him."`
`"*giggle*giggle*......"`
`"On top of that, he's an idiot and reckless.`
` He dreams way too big and talks about things he hasn't got a snowball's hope in hell of doing.`
` ......I guess in that respect, he's a super idiot worth the equivalent of ten billion normal idiots."`
`"But you look at the average person who hasn't even got the balls to be an idiot, and I'll bet that guy is gonna try things that ten billion of them couldn't do put together.`
` Well, I'm pretty sure he'll fall flat on his face.`
` The world isn't easy."`
`"......But at the very least,`
` there's no doubt in my mind that watching over his life will be more entertaining than looking at ten billion average people."`
`Eva clicked her tongue at the clever style of speech that would probably match Kinzo's tastes.`
`Apparently Rudolf had been after this himself—he grinned back at her.`
`"......What of Maria?"`
`"M‐......Maria is my darling only daughter.`
` Her value cannot be measured with money.`
` ......That is all."`
`"Hmm.`
` ............I see.`
` Dreams and the future, miracles and possibilities are the source of my magical power.`
` No magic holds power without hope."`
`"......Hmph, I cannot expect anything more from you people who have proven yourselves to be average, but...`
`yes, my grandchildren do have future possibilities, and it is possible that they may be worth hoping for a magical miracle from."`
`"If you say that this makes them worth more than ten billion, hmm, I could understand that.`
` ......Hmmm, hmmmm......"`
`When Kinzo got in a rage, he wouldn't let anyone talk back,`
` but even so, while yelling by himself, he would sometimes convince himself of something all of his own accord, and change his own opinion.`
`......That's what this felt like to the siblings.`
`Apparently, even though Kinzo had become absolutely fed up with his shoddy children and had cast them away as being unfit for the inheritance of his title or his fortune,`
` he wasn't so sure about his grandchildren.`
`......At this rate, he might soon say that the inheritance would go to his grandchildren instead of the siblings.`
`As the siblings sat in fear of what their fickle and short‐tempered father would suddenly think of next,`
` they carefully watched his every move...`
`"......Hmm.`
` ......Let me change my thinking a little.`
` I have absolutely no desire to see you people inherit all that is mine."`
`"However, it would be quite interesting to question the grandchildren to see whether one of them is qualified......`
` I've been thinking of them as kids who never grow up,`
` but there is a chance they will show me a glimmer of unpolished brilliance that will surprise me."`
`"And testing them for that would be...`
`...yes, that would be hard to pass over as a final diversion for my last remaining days.`
` ......Hmmmmm,`
` ......well then, what shall I do..."`
`"I, ...I can recommend George with confidence as a fitting successor for you, Father!"`
`Eva claimed that right away.`
`Natsuhi looked like she was about to follow along, but Krauss gave her a look telling her to restrain herself, so she swallowed her words.`
`"Hehheheheheheh!`
` How bold.`
` ......Then, let us do this.`
` I will individually question the grandchildren to see whether they are qualified to inherit the Ushiromiya family headship and all of its wealth."`
`"...Father—"`
`"Howeeever!!`
` .........I do not mean by this that one of you will receive the headship indirectly.`
` I have already lost hope in every one of you."`
`"I have nothing to give you now.`
` Nothing!`
` The ones I will question are the grandchildren.`
` And the ones who might succeed me are the grandchildren.`
` ......Make absolutely sure that you do not mistake this, are we clear......?"`
`".........I'll follow your decision, Father."`
`"Same here.`
` I'll go along with what you determine.`
` ......And you, Aneki?"`
`"O‐of course.`
` ......I believe that you will make a wise judgment, Father."`
`"I, I will also abide by your decision......"`
`"I shall think of how I will test the grandchildren.`
` And that no longer has anything to do with any of you.`
` Because you no longer have anything to do with the succession of the head."`
`"......So why don't I use this opportunity to talk about something else that does have something to do with you."`
`"Something else......?"`
`"Mm.`
` That is the true reason for tonight's...{i:final} Ushiromiya family conference."`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` What I demand from you is neither a discussion nor your opinions.`
` I demand cooperation.`
` For my ritual!"`
`"............Rituuaaal...?"`
`"Quiet...!`
` Father is talking now...!"`
`Rudolf and the rest automatically knitted their brows at the occult‐like word "ritual".`
`Was he talking about starting a strange ritual involving {f:5:Beatrice}'s resurrection again......?`
`He was demanding that they help...?`
`{n}What in the world was he planning to start?`
`In the past, he had carried out many eccentricities that he called by the same name, such as lighting a strange incense and filling the whole mansion with the stench.`
`To the siblings, a "ritual" was nothing more than one of the aged Kinzo's obnoxious hobbies.`
`"Father...`
` Just what do you mean by.........?"`
`"We'll assist you in any way that we can.`
` Right, Rosa?"`
`"Y‐yes......`
` But...what in the world...is it...?"`
`"The ritual as I inscribed it in the epitaph.`
` ......It is a ritual to revive {f:5:Beatrice}, and open the door to the Golden Land."`
`"That witch, who escaped her cage of flesh and sneeringly slipped through my fingers, I will finally be able to capture,`
` and subjugate, with my greatest hidden art.`
` .........Only, I must sacrifice thirteen people for that purpose."`
`"......Hehheheheheh!`
` It is not easy to gather thirteen sacrifices.`
` But tonight is the family conference!`
` Look how many have gathered on Rokkenjima.`
` There could be no other day on which to carry out this ritual."`
`Taken literally, it could only sound as though he was telling them to die as sacrifices for his disturbing ritual.`
`Ridiculous.`
` Was this some kind of metaphor...?`
`But they didn't even have a clue what he was trying to tell them through this analogy.`
`The siblings whispered together, wondering what Kinzo was saying......`
`"......What's Dad going on about?`
` Is it his usual bad sickness...?"`
`"Probably.`
` Keep quiet for now and hear him out."`
`"..........................."`
`"I'm sorry, Father...`
` I don't understand how you mean that."`
`"What is it you don't understand?`
` I am speaking extremely simply.`
` I have said that I shall choose thirteen people from among the humans on this island and offer them as sacrifices for my ritual to revive {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"Even worthless people like you can be very useful as sacrifices for my ritual.`
` Wa‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"`
`"......Hear this!!`
` This is not a joke nor anything of the sort.`
` This is my final bet, my final ritual, the last I will desire in my life!"`
`"There are now more than thirteen humans on this island.`
` In short, that's a head count which can easily satisfy this massive number of sacrifices!`
` Become the sacrifices for my ritual!!"`
`"......Kinzo‐san, ......you weren't...possibly......`
`serious about what you said back then...?!`
` It wasn't a joke......?!!"`
`Unusually for Nanjo, his face changed color and he stood up and shouted.`
`It seemed this wasn't the first time Nanjo had heard all this dark talk about thirteen sacrifices.`
`"Sorry, my friend.`
` That was not a joke nor anything of the sort.`
` It is what I bet my life on, the final ritual, the final game that I will challenge."`
`"Yes, this is a game!`
` If gaining my fortune and leaving the island is your goal, then there are only two ways to achieve it!"`
`"Successfully survive being chosen as one of the thirteen sacrifices, and stop the ritual by finally solving the riddle of the epitaph,`
` ......or kill me!`
` And stop the ritual in that manner.`
` Those are the only two ways!!"`
`By now, it was no longer whispering among those gathered there, but uneasy commotion.`
`Even the siblings had noticed that Kinzo was beginning to act abnormally...`
`"......Father, are you a little tired?`
` Genji‐san, has Father been drinking at all?"`
`"...............No.`
` The Master is quite lucid."`
`"Sorry, Dad,`
` but I don't have a clue what you've started going on about......"`
`"You're free to start up whatever weird ritual you want to revive the witch you love.`
` That's your hobby, after all.`
` But dragging me into all that, and making me into......hahaha, a sacrifice, is just not gonna happen."`
`"Rudolf, who asked you to chip in?!"`
`"What are you talking about, Aneki?!`
` You think I'm gonna sit here nodding my head at this, are you nuts?!"`
`Was the "ritual" Kinzo had mentioned literally the frightening thing it seemed to be,`
` or was it some kind of test to choose his successor?`
`It seemed that Rudolf had taken it at its disturbing face value,`
` but Eva apparently still believed that it was something like a trial, or examination,`
` to find the proper next head.`
`But Kinzo's response to this was clear.`
`"Well, that is all I have to say.`
` Nooo objections or viewpoints are necessary...!!"`
`"I will simply awaken from my dream in which I have four failures for children.`
` To all of you, what will occur now before your very eyes will no doubt seem like a dream, an illusion, an unearthly world that defies understanding."`
`"But that itself is my reality!!`
` Now, I will finally awaken from the fleeting and useless dream that all of you are!!"`
`"Come, the game has already begun!`
` With this many of you here, I hardly know whose life I should take first...!!"`
`"Good‐bye, my bungling sons and daughters.`
` And for the final and only time in your lives, be of use to me, for my ritual...!!`
` Arise, Pendragon Memorial Troops...!!"`
`As Kinzo raised his arms high like an opera singer, and yelled those words as though towards a packed audience...`
`...the air shattered like glass, .........and the figures of three people who hadn't been invited to this island appeared regardless......`
`"Chiester{ruby:forty‐five:45}, right here...!"`
`"Chiester{ruby:four‐one‐zero:410}, right heere!"`
`"Chiester{ruby:double‐oh:00}, right here, sir."`
`Three girls with bizarre forms suddenly appeared behind Kinzo.`
`Where from?`
` When?`
` Who?`
` Who are they??`
`......The {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s were thrown off balance and their minds went blank.`
`{n}And because they wasted time with such thoughts, they lost their last chance to survive.`
`"I grant you permission to shoot six people to death.`
` You have free choice of targets.`
` Begin attacking."`
`"Unrestricted firing understood, sir.`
` Thank you for the good targets.`
` All units, commence unrestricted firing."`
`"Nihi!`
` First one in nyeh!!`
` Hyahhah!!"`
`As 410 scratched the air with her finger, a golden bow appeared in empty space, and its string was pulled back.`
`The golden arrow that had been readied there was fired off without any hesitation, flew around the room leaving haphazard gold trails everywhere,`
` .........and from among those sitting at the table of the family conference, it chose Natsuhi, and pulverized the left half of her face.`
`Flesh and deep‐red blood splattered all around,`
` leaving a massive amount of deep‐red spatter marks on the relatives' faces and the pure white tablecloth.`
`......There was silence.`
`Despite the massive number of deep‐red blotches left on the tablecloth, even still,`
` .........no one could understand why Natsuhi's head was half smashed, nor why she was hanging her head as though she had dozed off in her chair,`
` .........and they watched these events in silence.`
`......Those sitting on the right‐hand side from Natsuhi were silent for a relatively long time,`
` but those sitting on her left were not.`
`......Because the people sitting on that side...`
`had been shown how her head had been smashed open like a watermelon or a pomegranate, and could even see inside her......`
`"Na......tsuhi............"`
`"......That's one.`
` Natsuhi, I see. A luckless woman to the end.`
` ......Next!"`
`"00, firing."`
`In the same way, 00 scratched the empty air to ready her bow, and fired.`
`Just like the golden arrow 410 had released, it flew around and around at high speeds, drawing a convoluted trail, after which,`
` ......as he looked at Natsuhi in shock, it smashed half of Rudolf's head in the same way, killing him instantly.`
`This time, everyone did not stop thinking altogether.`
` They realized that a terrible murder had been carried out right in front of them according to Kinzo's words.`
`And they understood that Kinzo would probably kill again......!`
`""Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!""`
`""Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!""`
`Shrill screams burst out.`
`Even now, they still didn't know what to do.`
`{n}So they could only keep screaming and flapping their wide‐open mouths like goldfish......`
`"F‐......Father......`
`what do you think you're doing......?"`
`"...Y‐you dolt!!`
` Hurry up and run!!"`
`As Eva asked Kinzo that in total shock,`
` Hideyoshi, who had come to his senses and risen from his chair faster than anyone else, pulled at her arm from behind.`
`However, merciless fate's choice for the third sacrifice...`
`......was Hideyoshi.`
`Just like the two before him, half of Hideyoshi's head was neatly smashed,`
` ......and the right side of his head, which happened to be facing that direction at the time, ......was blown away, chunks of its contents thrown everywhere like a watermelon or a pomegranate.`
`So, still holding Eva, ......Hideyoshi toppled backwards and fell down.`
`Still held by her beloved husband, Eva fell over backwards with him.`
`"Honey......?`
` Honey...?!`
` HiiiIiiIIiiiIIIIIII!!!"`
`Eva screamed.`
`...And who could blame her.`
`The face she had been looking for......had been half lost,`
` and the crushed skull, the squelchy exposed brain, and the crushed jaw were all bare......`
`"45, impact, on target...!"`
`"Spectacular.`
` Fire again.`
` Three remain."`
`"F‐Father...!!`
` W‐w‐w‐w‐w‐what, what...are you doing?!?!"`
`Krauss stood up forcefully, and was about to rush Kinzo, when 00 blocked him.`
`......Despite her slender‐looking body, she held back Krauss's body with just the palm of her right hand.`
`He still tried to resist and attack Kinzo,`
` so 00 lifted Krauss up by the collar, and twisted into his Adam's apple with her thumb.`
`It seemed to be very painful, and Krauss was overcome with agony.`
`"Gghh...oooooooohhhh......!!!`
` Everyone, ...run...!!`
` Get the police......!`
` Emergency services...!!`
` Quickly......!!"`
`"Everyone, let's escape!!`
` Escape!!"`
`Nanjo's sharp words finally broke the spell that had been holding them down in their chairs.`
`As Gohda and Kumasawa made a mad scramble to escape from the dining hall...`
`...410 teleported to that spot, blocking the way.`
`"Nihi! You sure are slow nye~h.`
` Did you think I'd let you escape nye~h{p:0:♪}"`
`"Hiieeeeeeeeeehhhh!!"`
`"H‐help meeeeeeeeeeeee!!"`
`"Gohda‐san, duck!!"`
`At the sound of Kyrie's sharp voice, Gohda, in a state of complete confusion, ducked.`
`......Then, a burst of air rushed above his head.`
`Kyrie had taken a big swing with a chair to mow 410 down.`
`But 410, still wearing a contemptuous expression, easily caught that widely swung chair with one hand.`
`"......Tch!"`
`"You're a scary woman nyeh.`
` You really wanna follow your husband that baaaaad?"`
`From the sleeve of the arm that she had used to catch the chair, something like a shining golden snake appeared,`
` ......coiled itself around the chair, and with a huge CRUNCH!! burst it into splinters.`
`It was a fearsome power, far stronger than any vice.`
`When Kyrie realized that the being in front of her, which looked like a girl,`
` was actually a being that surpassed human knowledge and which a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} could not even begin to oppose,`
` her head was filled with a great alarm bell that welled up from inside her...`
`Even with a scene like this before their eyes, Genji, Shannon, and Kanon, the servants permitted to wear the One‐winged Eagle, continued to stand calmly at attention by the wall,`
` making them look very bizarre and eerie.`
`For an instant, Kyrie thought that the source of their calmness...`
`was that they were with the enemy, and had been guaranteed that they wouldn't be killed.`
`......But no sooner had she thought that than the side of Genji's face was blown away before her eyes.`
`"G‐Genji‐san......"`
`"45, impact, on target...!"`
`"......Hohoh, Genji, now that is unfortunate.`
` ......Rest in peace, my friend.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*, your death will not be wasted.`
` You will become one of the thirteen keys essential to the resurrection of my beloved witch.`
` Fuhha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha......"`
`The half of Genji's expression that remained...`
`...was as indifferent as ever.`
`He tilted, ......fell in a heap, and sent a blood‐red splatter out across the floor......`
`".........Genji‐sama..............."`
`"............We're nothing more...than the witch's pieces.`
` .........Nothing more............nothing more......"`
`From the meek, ...and frustrated...`
`no, ......resigned expressions on Shannon and Kanon's faces, you couldn't feel any naive expectation that they would be saved.`
`That's right.`
` Kinzo was, in the truest sense, .........carrying out these murders at random.`
`In the truest sense, ......he was killing like it was a game to see who would be saved and who would be killed.`
`"Wellll then, whoo'll we go for next nye~h.`
` Nihhihi!!"`
`410 looked at Kyrie for a second.`
`{n}In that second, ......Kyrie prepared for her own death.`
`But once she had readied her golden bow in midair, 410 looked at someone else over Kyrie's shoulder.`
`......So, as shameless as it was, Kyrie sensed that she had been saved......`
`Again, an ugly sound of something cracking and exploding rang throughout the room.`
`......Who was it this time?`
`When Kyrie turned in the direction of the sound...`
`.........she saw Eva collapse onto her husband's chest, gushing blood like a fountain.`
`...Of course, her face was half smashed just like her husband's......`
`410 had mercilessly targeted Eva as she clung to her husband's body, sobbing.`
`"L‐let go of Nii‐san...!!`
` Let go of Nii‐san...!!`
` Just stop it, Father!!`
` Just stop this brutality!!"`
`"......Run, Rosa......`
` Ggh, ghhk, .........!"`
`Rosa's protestations weren't reaching Kinzo as he continued to laugh loudly in the blood‐spattered dining hall,`
` and nor was she able to lessen Krauss's pain as 00 lifted him up by the collar.`
`So Rosa had no choice but to use force.`
` She raised one of the chairs beside her over her head, and gave a warning.`
`"Father...!!`
` Order her to let go of Nii‐san!`
` Just make them stop all this!!"`
`"I think not.`
` If that is what you desire, then prevent it using your own power.`
` ......Cut a path open for your own fate with your own hands.`
` You who have always hid behind the backs of others in fear, show me the final bit of self‐mastery that dwells within you...!!`
` Fuhha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!!"`
`"F‐......Father......`
` .........UWAAA{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}Aa{0}A{0}Aa{0}AHHHH!!!"`
`The chair that Rosa had lifted up...`
`......swung down at the father who had reigned as a symbol of terror for her entire life.`
`It was the greatest, and final, act of bravery and self‐mastery in Rosa's life.`
`Kinzo might have been right.`
`......If she had grasped that courage much, much sooner,`
` her life might have been more free, unrestrained by anyone else.`
`Then, a loud bursting sound.`
`......The sound of Rosa's chair fiercely hitting Kinzo,`
` ...it was not.`
`Still lifting up the chair,`
` .........she neatly lost half of her head, and fell with a thud.`
`While still holding Krauss up with one hand, ......00 had stuck her other hand out towards Rosa.`
`The golden snake released from that arm...`
`had constricted Rosa in a helix,`
` ......and chewed a hole through her head.`
`"......Defensive firing.`
` I apologize for the discourtesy of a point‐blank shot, sir."`
`"It matters not.`
` Hmm, so this makes six?"`
`"Yes, Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}, sir.`
` This makes six."`
`After declaring this with indifference, 00 let go of Krauss, who she had been lifting up this whole time.`
`"Hmmm.`
` So, the sacrifices of the first twilight were Eva, Rudolf, Rosa, Natsuhi, Hideyoshi, and Genji.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`It was a massacre that happened in an instant.`
`The interior of the dining hall was dirtied with blood spatter,`
` ......and the six unlucky victims lay with their heads brutally exposed.`
`Fittingly, it was Kinzo's abnormal laugh alone that echoed in that abnormal space......`
`"Hahhahahahahaha, wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!`
` The curtain has finally risen!`
` It's the beginning of the ritual to revive {f:5:Beatrice}...!!"`
`"You lucky ones who have managed to escape the first twilight, allow me to introduce you to my friends.`
` Arise, my friend!`
` Ronove...!!"`
`When Kinzo called Ronove's name, the demon butler appeared out of thin air, bowing deeply and respectfully......`
`"It is a pleasure to meet you all.`
` And to those of you for whom this is a long‐overdue reunion, good day.`
` Pu ku ku ku...!`
` It seems that we once again have a spectacular mess on our hands."`
`"I care not.`
` This level of stimulus is necessary to wake me from my days of waking dreams.`
` Allow me to introduce you. My friend, reliable butler, and one of the 72 Great Demons, Ronove."`
`"I am pleased to make your acquaintance."`
`Just who was he aiming that introduction at?`
`......Krauss and Kyrie, who were still down on their backsides, and Nanjo, and Gohda, and Kumasawa...`
`could only look up in shock at this middle‐aged gentleman who they had never met before......`
`Only Shannon and Kanon seemed to recognize him, and they bowed deeply...`
`"......I see that I was unable to greet Genji.`
` I hope that he was at least able to complete his duty painlessly."`
`"It was an instant death from a direct hit to the head...!`
` He didn't have the time to feel the pain."`
`"Is that so?`
` Very good."`
`"Allow me to introduce another of my friends.`
` Arise, my friend, {f:5:Virgilia}...!!"`
`Once again, the figure of someone unknown to the relatives appeared out of thin air.`
`{n}She appeared in an elegant dress while greeting them gracefully.`
`".........I thank you for summoning me, my lord.`
` Although I would rather not have been summoned into a sanguinary place such as this."`
`"Allow me to introduce her too.`
` This is my friend and reliable counselor both, {f:5:Virgilia}.`
` ......I want to borrow your power as a great Finite Witch for my ritual.`
` Lend me that power!"`
`"......As someone under your powerful summoning subordination, I would not be permitted to refuse even if I tried.`
` As you wish, my lord."`
`"............He is a fearsome fellow.`
` To think that he summoned three of the Chiester Sisters Corps, and then me, and even {f:5:Virgilia}‐sama..."`
`"......Even though it is only in the area of summoning, to think that he far surpasses Milady is......frightening.`
` The Ushiromiya blood makes my own run cold."`
`"I will be putting all I have as a summoner into the execution of {f:5:Beatrice}'s resurrection ritual.`
` It's still not enough.`
` In order to perfectly succeed in the ritual this time, I shall summon more."`
`"The Pendragon Memorial Troops, Ronove, and {f:5:Virgilia}...`
` ......I can still call more... With my magical power, I can still call many more......!!"`
`"Answer to my summons......`
`one of the 72 demons, Gaap!!"`
`"Gaap...?`
` You can even summon her......?"`
`"It probably means that the corrosion has advanced even more on this island.`
` ......It's enough to enable us to manifest.`
` It would surely not be a surprise to see him summon any kind of great demon at this stage."`
`"Then Rokkenjima has already been completely sucked into a parallel world?`
` ............I hope he doesn't surrender."`
`".........You gave him a good deal of hints the last time, did you not?`
` After all this time, he won't surrender over this much.`
` Probably, I should say."`
`"Pu ku ku!`
` .........Well then, I suggest we enjoy the action unfolding on the stage.`
` It seems the main character is the Master this time.`
` Let us look forward to a script of a different flavor than Milady's."`
`As Kinzo strongly concentrated his magical power, ......a pale blue light gathered in the air, twisted,`
` ......and a magic circle began to be drawn with a deep‐red light.`
`Then it shattered with a sound like glass, .........and a new demon could be seen there.`
`"......I am glad to see that you answered my call.`
` ......Gaap, one of the 72 Great Demons...!"`
`"............This is a hell of a place I've been summoned into.`
` Did you call me to clean up this blood‐stained room?`
` {f:5:Goldsmith}...?"`
`The literally devilish woman, wrapped in a gaudy, ominous costume,`
` looked at the horrifying scene which should have made her cover her eyes, ...and her mouth twisted into a grin......`
`"If that had been the only reason for calling you,`
` it would be like using a cashmere scarf to mop the floor."`
`"It's been a long time, Gaap.`
` ......To think that a Great Demon such as yourself has finally appeared on this island.`
` ......I wonder if this island has nearly sunk into fantasy."`
`"This all‐star cast is more astonishing than the gruesome state of the room.`
` .........A full three Chiester Sisters, the Great Demon Ronove, the Great Witch {f:5:Virgilia}, and even me."`
`"What's going on?`
` Is this Pandemonium?`
` Are you trying to start a concert from hell or something?`
` .........Yes, as a conductor for that, I can't imagine anyone other than you, {f:5:Goldsmith}."`
`"I will have your assistance as facilitator in the completion of my ritual to resurrect {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` You have no objections to my summoning contract, I assume...?"`
`"Objections?`
` There's no way {i:I} could fight the summoning subordination of the legendary Great Summoner, Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}, who enslaved the famous Great Witch {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......I'll assist you.`
` Although I will of course charge a fitting price.`
` ......So?`
` What's my first job?"`
`"Capture the simpletons who made it through the first twilight.`
` Fortunately, there are still seven here, aren't there?`
` Nanjo, Shannon, Kanon, Gohda, Kumasawa, Kyrie, and Krauss...!"`
`"Hoh, if these seven are all offered as sacrifices, that's exactly thirteen people!`
` Until it is time for the second and later twilights to be carried out, throw them into the cage of sacrifices, gehehehah!!"`
`"............A cashmere mop, I see.`
` Understood."`
`As Gaap shrugged her shoulders, she looked at Krauss, who was still down on his butt.`
`She glared.`
`Then, she snapped her fingers, ......and Krauss was swallowed up by the floor, as though a round pitfall had opened up there.`
`"Uu...waarg........."`
`"One down."`
`There was no hole in the floor.`
` But it had certainly looked as though Krauss had been swallowed up by a hole and disappeared......`
`"............!!"`
`Searching for her next prey, Gaap's gaze crossed Kyrie's.`
`{n}She snapped her fingers.`
`Kyrie jumped back as though repelled.`
`Her instinct was correct.`
` Because, in the place where she had been until a second ago, a round, jet‐black hole had appeared, the same kind that had swallowed up Krauss.`
`However, before she could catch her balance, another pitfall appeared and swallowed her up.`
`......Even Kyrie had no way of eluding Gaap's capture.`
`"Uwaahhhhh......!!"`
`Snap went her fingers once again, and a shocked Nanjo disappeared into the floor.`
`Another snap of the fingers,`
` and 410 let out a short yelp and jumped back.`
`This time, a slightly larger pitfall had opened, taking in both Shannon and Kanon, who had been standing in a line by the door.`
`But because 410 had jumped away from the door, the way was no longer blocked.`
`Instinctively aware that they would be next, Gohda dashed out through that door.`
`Of course, Kumasawa too was hot on his heels, and ran off at lightning speed.`
`As Gaap snapped her fingers over and over,`
` round, jet‐black pitfalls opened one after another behind them, chasing them.`
`However, they did nothing but drive the desperately fleeing pair forward, and couldn't swallow them up.`
`Gohda and Kumasawa escaped in a matter of seconds......`
`".........I've dulled.`
` I let two get away."`
`"Worry not, we are currently locking onto the fleeing targets."`
`"Data link ready.`
` Nihi!`
` Shall we snipe?"`
`"No, I cannot authorize that.`
` They are precious sacrifices.`
` Wait for the Master's authorization."`
`"Great Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}...!`
` We await your orders...!"`
`"It is still too soon for the coming of the second twilight, ......is what the source of my magical power is whispering to me.`
` Not now.`
` Let them do as they like.`
` They cannot escape from this island in any case."`
`"The source of your magical power is noise and risk and tests of luck.`
` ......Hoh‐hoh‐ho, your whims, in other words?"`
`"Hhhhehhehheh, perhaps you could also put it that way.`
` Good work, Gaap.`
` Let us proceed steadily with the ritual from here on."`
`".........Well then, that is that.`
` Next is my grandchildren.`
` .........I will test them to see whether they are qualified to succeed me.`
` Let me see, how best to check their qualifications.`
` Kuheheheh...!!"`
`"If you determine that they are qualified,`
` ......do you intend to abandon Beato's resurrection?"`
`"Of course.`
` Yet still I will test them.`
` ......Hmph, I doubt a woman can understand that contradiction, or my madness.`
` Khhhahahahah..."`
`".........There's always something not quite right about men.`
` The very concept of playing with risk is beyond me."`
`"Oh, and here I thought you loved that sort of thing?"`
`"Of course.`
` If a man whispers intimacies in my ear along with dangerous risk, I go head over heels.`
` ...But only if he's a stud!"`
`"Pu ku ku ku ku ku...!"`
`"Quiet, please.`
` No talking among yourselves."`
`"Hmph, truly noisy women.`
` But at least they don't bore me.`
` ......This is why summoning is so gratifying.`
` All of you will bear one side of the scales of noise and risk in my ritual.`
` I am anticipating great results...!"`
`Six brutally murdered corpses lay in the dining hall, which was tarnished by a red and gruesome decoration......`
`By now, it was impossible to imagine that thirteen people had been sitting here in an orderly manner just moments ago.`
`Kinzo lined up the demons of renown and their subordinates, loudly declared the beginning of an overwhelming night of mass murder,`
` and swore to himself that he would certainly revive {f:5:Beatrice}, and open the door to the Golden Land......`
`"The wait is over!!`
` At last the curtain rises on the first twilight!!`
` *cackle*!`
` That Kinzo, as usual, he loves being flashy.`
` Who knew that this man, who can be more persistent than anything when he follows you around, could shine so when placed on the stage."`
`"Dammit......`
` Always killing them in a gory way......`
` Destroying half of their heads?!`
` The sick shit you witches and demons pull never fails to piss me off...!"`
`"Destroying half of their heads...... I see.`
` So she noticed that the most ideal method of killing, in all the games up until now, was this one."`
`"Ideal?`
` How the crap is this grotesque way of killing ideal?!"`
`"......It's very much ideal.`
` Try and remember the very first game."`
`"You......!`
` So you're that new demon or whatever that just appeared...`
` Goddammit, so the witch's corrosion advanced, and now there are even more unsavory characters...?!"`
`......The more the witch's corrosion progresses, the more Rokkenjima tilts towards the other world.`
`That's why strange people keep appearing one by one.`
`This island is closed off by the typhoon, and not only can no {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s leave it, but new {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s can't appear either.`
`But the more the corrosion progresses, the more witches and demons can appear, without limit.`
` Increasing one by one.`
`By now, perhaps there are more demons than {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s among the characters appearing in this insane tale.`
` ......Their numbers might be precisely the figure representing this mad corrosion.`
`Yeah, I'm sure that's true.`
` And not only are their numbers being affected by the corrosion, their fashion sense apparently is as well.`
`If the corrosion advances any further and even more weird people appear, just what in the world will they be wearing?`
` .........It's too scary for me to imagine...`
`......Aaaah, seriously, give me a break...`
`{n}Please, no more of these weird‐ass people...!!`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*! I can't oblige—they'll keep on coming, more and more!!`
` I'll defile the foolish "closed circle" rule {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s speak of, over and over again...!"`
`"Welcome to my elegant game!`
` Gaap!"`
`".........It's been a long time, Riiche.`
` Been well?`
` ...In fact, you look pretty great.`
` Have you gotten younger?`
` You look two, maybe three hundred years younger than when I last saw you.`
` ............Ah, I see."`
`The demon Grandfather had summoned and introduced as Gaap...`
`took a glance at me, and then grinned as though she'd figured something out on her own.`
`......Honestly, I felt that smile was repulsive.`
`"Looks like she's Beato's friend.`
` ......Which means she must be an extremely unsavory character.`
` Anyway, they were saying something or other about a closed circle, but what does that mean?"`
`"Serial murder mystery novels that occur in places isolated from the outside world, like Rokkenjima is now, are sometimes called closed circles.`
` Since it's isolated from the outside, it's like a circle that's closed.`
` ......Therefore, in general, the characters and suspects are limited."`
`"Having new possible suspects added on one after another from outside the circle goes against the etiquette of mystery novels.`
` ......Basically, the witch is probably trying to desecrate {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s and the mystery genre."`
`".........So you are Gretel?`
` I see, you look like a wise kid, ......*giggle*.`
` I like that kind of kid.`
` ......Their tongues just melt in the mouth."`
`"Gross.`
` ......Keep the jokes to just your clothing."`
`"It's Devilish Pretty's newest, "Jack the Ripper: Christmas Blood".`
` ......Sorry for having a style that a country bumpkin from the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world can't understand."`
`"......Well, I can at least tell it's breathable.`
` Why don't you add a gap down your head while you're at it?`
` Might help your brain cells breathe a bit as well."`
`"Gaap is always sensitive to the fashions of the netherworld!`
` But this year's fads truly are bold.`
` I think I'll order something sometime...!"`
`"For you, Riiche, I'd recommend {nobr:Ali‐Gray}—Alice and the Graveyard.`
` Let's go to {c:86EF9C:666} sometime soon to look at the clothes.`
` You should come over to the netherworld every now and then."`
`"When this game is over, I'll be sure to do that.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`".........Still, your two opponents are pretty cute, Riiche.`
` I'll bet this kid has figured out the meaning of the corpses with their heads half smashed.`
` .........Do you get it, girl......?"`
`"......Just now, she told me to remember the first game.`
` ......What did that mean...?"`
`"Just what it sounds like.`
` ......Remember the first twilight of the very first game.`
` ......When the adults' corpses were found in the gardening shed with the magic circle drawn on it.`
` Remember?"`
`Episode 1.`
` The first twilight.`
`Six people—Krauss, Rudolf, Kyrie, Rosa, Shannon, and Gohda—had died, and each of them had had their head pulverized.........`
`"At that time, there were two types of corpses.`
` The ones with their faces pulverized, and the ones with half of their faces pulverized."`
`"That's right.`
` Four with their faces smashed—Rudolf, Kyrie, Rosa, and Gohda.`
` Two with the sides of their heads smashed—Krauss and Shannon."`
`"......At the time, I had fickly created two types of corpses,`
` but I realized that the former, more atrocious type was actually disadvantageous for me."`
`"......Disadvantageous for you......?`
` ............Right.`
` I get it."`
`That's right.`
` The smashed faces might look atrocious.`
`{n}......But they made it hard to confirm the identity of the person.`
`For example, at that time, Uncle Krauss and Shannon‐chan had had their heads only half‐smashed.`
`That itself was of course atrocious, but because half of their faces remained, it was easy to confirm their identity.`
`But Dad and the other three were different.`
`Because his face had been completely destroyed, even I, his son, could only guess that it had to have been Dad because of his clothes and the like.`
`......In short, it remained unclear until the end whether that really was Dad's corpse.`
`"If this reasoning battle had taken place during the first game as well,`
` I would probably have claimed that, since it was impossible to confirm that those corpses were indeed Dad and the others, there was a possibility that one was a fake corpse.`
` ......After all, Beato didn't state anything in red during that game whatsoever."`
`"Well done. Correct.`
` .........A faked death is one of the basics of the mystery genre.`
` Even if you make a doctor examine the corpse, you can't trust the results if you suspect him of being in league with the culprit.`
` So, corpses that can't guarantee a death for certain always put the witch side at a disadvantage."`
`"You can suspect faked deaths for all corpses, and hypothesize that they are the culprit for the incidents that follow.`
` ......It's a move Battler doesn't like, but it's the most elementary move to use against a witch."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` That's why Beato started using the red.`
` ......With the red truth, she can carry out a perfect autopsy."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` That's how it is.`
` Normally, for the tragedy of the first twilight,`
` I would use the red truth right away, confirming the deaths of these six."`
`"However, as you know, my battle strategy this time is the complete opposite of previous games, and I have switched to using red truth starvation tactics...!"`
`"I will not use the red easily given that you use it as a grounding from which to counterattack.`
` I can just make you come apart at the seams by using the minimum necessary amount of red in just a single place!"`
`"What this means is that no matter how I permit you to rant about your theories for each of the locked rooms, ultimately,`
` I need only smash one of those with a single red truth."`
`"Ihihi!`
` You've been knocking me about with that thing all this goddamn time, and now I've started using it to counterattack, you've gone and put it away again.`
` What a joke."`
`"Anyways, I don't wanna use the red, I wanna be stingy!`
` I wanna bully Battleeer!!"`
`"But how could I guarantee a death for certain without using red?`
` I racked and racked my brains over it.`
` ......It was Gaap that gave me the idea!`
` It truly was a simple method.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"......I just said something obvious and you hit upon the idea.`
` I simply said that you just have to create corpses whose identity and total death can be easily appreciated by anyone who looks at them."`
`"Kuhhihihihi!`
` In short, I combined the two!`
` The face, which is necessary to distinguish their identity; and the symbol of total death, the pulverization of the head, which is the vessel for the soul!"`
`"When I put those two parts neatly together, oh, hey presto!`
` Out came the <perfect> answer of corpses with their heads half destroyed!"`
`"I'll bet you love two‐flavor bread and two‐flavor ice cream.`
` Your greedy childish tastes are so obvious..."`
`".........In any event,`
` even if their heads are half destroyed, we shouldn't assume that they're dead at this point in time."`
`"I know.`
` ......Since Beato is holding out on me and refusing to say anything in red, I should suspect everything.`
` ......Of course, there's no way in hell I'm gonna swallow the magic mass‐murder by the sexy‐assed Chiester babes."`
`"*giggle*.`
` You certainly have become shrewd.`
` ......If this were the first game, you would have swallowed everything."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` An adversary must be like that, or he wouldn't be interesting."`
`"There is no red for now—I suggest you capitalize on that to let your imagination run wild and build up theory upon theory.`
` At the very end, at the very sweetest spot, I'll cut them all down at once with the red truth...!"`
`"..................Ah, ...............uug........."`
`Silent.`
` Black.`
` Cold.`
` Painful.`
`Rosa regained consciousness bit by bit......`
`And the first thing she thought...was that it would have been better if she hadn't.`
`After all, her body was so cold and hurt so much, ......and it became worse the more her consciousness returned.`
`It felt like she had been sleeping in the darkness for a long time now, face‐down on ice‐cold marble.`
`......Aaah, this is why I always tell myself.`
`{n}Even if it's just a nap, at least get on the sofa.`
`I always know that if I naively try and close my eyes for just a second,`
` and end up sleeping on the floor or at my desk, it'll hurt my body later and I'll suffer for it......`
`Because she slept on such a cold and hard floor, she was chilled to the bone.`
`Because she slept on such a hard and cold floor, the side of her face that had been pressing down against it was very painful.`
`......If she were to look in a mirror right now, she was sure she would see an embarrassing mark.`
`She didn't think that just rubbing it would make that mark disappear,`
` but she stroked the hurting side of her face for the time being, trying to smooth it over...`
`......Where.........is this?`
`She thought it was pitch black, but that appeared not to be the case.`
`{n}After all, she could faintly see her own body.`
`......Without a doubt, there was some source of light,`
` but even when she looked up at the ceiling, ......or else the sky, there was only an expanse of blackness, and she couldn't see any such thing.`
`Her body alone was slightly lit,`
` whereas everything else was sunk in darkness......that's what this world was like.`
`It was almost as though Rosa alone had been abandoned in a forgotten world.`
`As her mind grew clearer,`
` she started getting nervous about why she was all alone in a lonely place like this.`
`......When she was about to call out, asking if anyone was there,`
` ......patter,`
` ...patter,`
` she heard footsteps coming towards her.`
`They were light footsteps, so she thought it was probably a kid.`
`{n}They didn't feel creepy to her, so she wasn't afraid.`
`But they also weren't Maria's footsteps,`
` so, wondering who in the world would be in a darkness like this, she stared in the direction she could hear the footsteps from.`
`.........As she did, ......a faint, approaching silhouette came into view.`
`It looked......like a child much younger than Maria.`
`......Who is that?`
` I didn't know him.`
`But, the expression on his face was like a lost child separated from his parents.`
`...As a parent with a daughter myself, I felt as though my chest was being torn apart...`
`‘........................Uryu.’`
`"......ah— ............"`
`The instant the kid muttered that infantile word,`
` ......I felt a sharp pain in the half of my face that was aching from the cold floor, as though it had been pierced by long, thin, hard needles.`
`I reflexively pressed my hand against that side of my face.`
`‘......Are you okay......?`
` Does it still hurt......?’`
`"...Thank you, little guy.`
` .........Where is this...?`
` It's really......cold."`
`‘......Come this way......`
` You can't be here......’`
`He took my other hand and pulled, with a grim expression on his face.`
`......I don't have a clue what's going on.`
` However, a single honest expression from a child...`
`can often tell the truth better than a hundred empty words from an adult.`
`She didn't understand the situation, but even so, Rosa dashed along with him wherever she was pulled...`
`However, this was a world where nothing could be seen in the darkness except for their own forms.`
`{n}She couldn't even really feel whether she was actually moving forwards as she ran.`
`......Even though I'm running, I can't even feel any wind.`
` It's as though I'm still inside a nightmare...that kind of unreal feeling...`
`So even though I was running, I couldn't maintain my sense of balance, and my legs got tangled and I fell.`
`......Even in a world that didn't feel real, the pain of smashing my face against the cold, hard floor was reality itself.`
`‘Uryu...... Are you okay......?’`
`"Ug—.........hh...`
` ......I'm sorry, my head hurts."`
`......When he said that......infantile word "uryu", pain like being stuck with needles ran though my head again.`
`Even though it had only happened twice,`
` I was somehow able to understand that his word was the cause of my pain.`
`......So I said so frankly.`
`"I'm sorry.`
` Could you stop saying that "uryu"...?"`
`‘Uryu......’`
`"Hhhk, ......excuse me, I asked you to stop..."`
`‘U‐...au, ...uu!`
` Sorry......’`
`This time, I got the feeling that his words of apology made me feel a sharp pain in my forehead.`
`.........What is...this child......?`
`I know there's no malice in him,`
` ......but when I'm around him,`
` ......my head hurts......`
`‘......Are you okay......?`
` Let's hurry up and go......`
` You mustn't be here.......’`
`"Why shouldn't I be here...?`
` Come on, where is this......?`
` Who are you?`
` Where is your mama...?"`
`‘.........But the one who made me...`
`...is you, Mama...’`
`"......Huh......?"`
`He stared at me with round eyes.`
`......This kid's mama.........is me......?`
`{n}......Who is he?`
` Who is this kid?`
`I don't remember at all.`
`‘Did you......forget about me......?`
` You made me, you know......?’`
`"......Wait a second, stop kidding around.`
` ...Maria is my only child.`
` .........That's right, where is Maria?`
` Where's Maria?!`
` Maria......?!"`
`I suddenly grew uneasy about Maria not being there.`
`{n}Why am I all alone in a place like this?`
`Where's Maria?!`
`{n}Maria being there for me is the only thing that keeps me together...!`
`‘...Maria is here, ......but she's not Maria right now.`
` It's better if you don't see her at the minute.`
` That will be better for you, and Maria as well.`
` .........For Maria's sake as well, run away.’`
`"Huh......?`
` What are you talking about?`
` Where's Maria?`
` Maria?!`
` Answer meee!!"`
`‘Maria will find you...!`
` Come this way, quickly, Mama...!’`
`He pulled my hand again.`
` ......He was probably pulling me in the opposite direction from Maria.`
` So I stopped in my tracks.`
`"Let go...!`
` Just who are you...?!`
` Who said you could call me Mama...?!"`
`‘......You're the one who made me, Mama...`
` Did you forget......?`
` So that I could be Maria's birthday present,`
` ......you made me with your own hands, ...did you forget......?’`
`"........................You......couldn't be......`
`.........Maria's......Sakutarou............?!"`
`‘Yeah.........`
` The lion stuffed animal you made...!’`
`"Gya—!!"`
`A fierce, sharp pain struck me.`
`{n}It came from the palm of the hand he was grasping.`
`I instinctively knocked his hand away, and when I looked at my palm...`
`.........a hole the size of a thumb had opened there, and thick, deep‐red blood was gushing out.`
`...It was a hole so big that I could see through to the other side......`
`‘U‐uryu......!`
` Are you okay?!`
` Are you okay?!`
` What happened...?!’`
`Sakutarou also noticed my wound, and panicked.`
`......Judging by his reaction, he couldn't understand why my hand had sustained a serious injury.`
`But, to my eyes, it felt like I had sustained that injury because he had grabbed my hand.`
`Whether there was malice in him or not,`
` ......I understood that this child was something that would do harm to me, and he instantly became strange and frightening......`
`"Go away......!!`
` I don't know you...!`
` Sakutarou was just a disgusting, crappy stuffed animal, right...?!!"`
`"I don't know you, I'm not your mama...!!`
` Go away...!`
` Disappear!!"`
`‘.........U..................yu.........’`
`Slowly, ......the base of Sakutarou's neck...`
`...tore in a horizontal line.`
`It gaped open, and the pitch blackness inside him peeked out.`
`{n}......There was no gushing of blood.`
`{n}Only an endlessly empty blackness.`
`And then, .........from the inside of the gash...`
`cotton snow poured out, ......and he slumped over, scattering bits of cotton about.`
`All that remained there......was crumpled yellow cloth,`
` and bits of cotton that looked like sticky, crushed cotton candy.`
`.........A lion...stuffed animal.`
`Without a doubt.`
` They were the remains of the Sakutarou stuffed animal I had torn apart on that day, overcome by my emotions.`
`The instant I admitted that,`
` ............a long, sharp shriek that could rupture an eardrum tore the world apart......`
`"WAAA{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}AaaA{0}AaA{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}AaAaaA{0}A{0}AAH{0}H{0}HHhH{0}H{0}HHHhHH!!!`
` Sakutaroooooooo, Sakutaroooooooooo, waaa{0}a{0}a{0}ahhaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aauuhhhh!!`
` Waa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aauu{0}uuhhhh!!"`
`Like a flood from a broken dam, or like a broken TV...`
`{n}......Maria wailed in a high‐pitched voice.`
`.........Maria's voice, which made the ears throb, brought up two emotions...`
`The first was regret: "Aahh, I let my emotions get the better of me and committed a terrible mistake..."`
`A mother's desire to kneel down right away, hold Maria's head, cry with her and apologize.`
`......And in fact, I did that right away.`
`{n}I held Maria's head and apologized in tears for what I had done.`
`But Maria didn't stop crying.`
` On the contrary, she rejected me, the one who had torn her closest friend apart, and pushed me away forcefully with both hands.`
`Since I had been on my knees in an unnatural position, I fell backwards easily.`
`Maria scraped together the yellow scraps of cloth and cotton bits, ......buried her face in them, and cried even more...`
`Watching that, the other emotion welled up.`
`{n}It welled up rapidly.`
` ......And then burst.`
`I mean, she won't come around even when I apologize, and there's nothing I can do now anyway, and it's all Maria's fault in the first place...!!`
`I mean she can't make any friends because since she's forever taken up with this make‐believe stuffed animal thing, and that's why she's treated like a weirdo, and, you know...!!`
`This is a good opportunity...for instructive guidance!`
` It's not like I was pampered all the time myself...!!`
`Things eventually break, are stolen, are broken!`
`Even I had lots of toys and treasures stolen, broken, made fun of,`
` and thrown away by my brothers and sister and father and mother...!!`
`But though I might have cried about that, ......though I might have shed a few tears......`
`not once did I sob like this and trouble my parents,`
` throw a tantrum, get in a terrible mood,`
` pound and kick the floor and make a horrible racket...!!`
`I always wanted to, but I thought I'd get in more trouble if I did, so I always, always held it in.`
`{a:c:`
`It's because I held it in{n}ThAT i wAS ablE TO beCoMe THe WOnDerFuL aDULT i aM NOw!!!}`
`Suddenly, I felt something strangely...missing.`
`The same feeling as when you use a tool recklessly, and it finally breaks, so that you're left holding only the base.`
`But I hadn't been using a tool.`
`{n}I had only been using my own two hands to hit Maria's head repeatedly.`
`So, ......I looked at my hands.`
`......From my wrists onwards, my hands had snapped off, cracked off, ......and were gone.`
`As though only those parts of my arms had become ceramic.`
`......No, everything beyond my wrists literally had become ceramic at some point, and had broken and fallen.`
`Cracks had formed in them because I had hit Maria too much, and they had fallen off.`
`......Look, see, ...aren't those my hands there, lying smashed by my feet......?`
`"h.........?`
` hiiiiIiiIiIiiiiii...!!!"`
`There was no pain.`
` But the shocking sight of both my hands breaking off at the wrists made me scream......`
`"Wh‐what?!`
` What?!`
` My hands, ......hands, hands...!!`
` Eeee{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}eekkkk!!!"`
`"..............................`
` .........This way, ......you won't be able to hit me anymore."`
`Ignoring my confusion, ......Maria said that with a very cold voice,`
` ......as she slowly moved her hands away from her head, where they had been defending against my barrage......`
`"......What is this?!`
` My hands, my hands...!!`
` What did you do, Maria, what is this, what is this what is this...?!"`
`A black silhouette was suddenly standing behind Maria.`
`{n}......It was the silhouette of an adult.`
`............Who?!`
`".........Since an arm can pat a daughter's head, flip through a picture book, and make warm meals,`
` ......I thought it might be alright to leave them."`
`"Mama hits my head more than she pats it.`
` ......She doesn't turn the pages of a picture book.`
` She doesn't even make food.`
` ......I go to buy it myself."`
`"......But I'm not allowed to go to the same store over and over,`
` not allowed to have my face remembered, not allowed to talk to policemen...`
` .........Why?`
` Why is that?`
` Did I do something wrong?"`
`"Am I not allowed to have you pat my head, have picture books read to me,`
` eat dinner together with you...?`
` Why?`
` Why?!"`
`"It's NOT my fault!!`
` Not my fault, yours!!`
` YOUR fault!!"`
`"You don't play with me, but Sakutaro did!"`
`"He read books with me, watched TV with me, ate meals with me!!`
` He was a much, MUCH more important friend than YOU!!!"`
`"...I, ......I'm not proud of it...!`
` Bu‐but it can't be helped, can it?!`
` Mama's busy with work—work!!`
` You know that Mama's busy with work, right?!`
` What am I supposed to do?!!`
` There's nothing I can do!!"`
`"That is true.`
` There is nothing to be done.`
` Nothing to be done about injuring your daughter, tearing her heart apart, and making her tears run with blood...!`
` Then there's nothing to be done about the same thing happening again, right here, right now...!!"`
`"Come, {f:5:Maria}...!`
` That is enough for the excuses of the woman who calls herself a mother.`
` Can you forgive her, or not...?!`
` Is she innocent, or else guilty?!?!"`
`"Can't forgive her!!`
` Mama is guilty!!`
` I'll make the same thing happen to Mama that she did to Sakutaro...!!`
` Take Mama, ......and rip her from the seam at the neck,`
` ......rip her apart, and throw the cotton inside her everywhere!!"`
`......Maria's eyes ominously flashed blue.`
`In that instant, invisible, massive arms stuck their fingernails out and grasped Rosa's entire body tightly.`
`The bones all throughout her body made sounds like twigs being stepped on as they readily cracked and broke.`
`.........Rosa vaguely understood.`
` The massive arms are probably......my own arms, from the time I tore Sakutarou apart.`
`From a stuffed animal's perspective, my arms must certainly have been this massive.`
`So I could imagine what would happen next.`
`......The sharp nails stuck strongly into the base of my neck, ......and I heard the skin tearing with my own ears.`
`Then, watched over by the two witches, Rosa's flesh was split in two, top and bottom.`
`When Sakutarou had been torn apart, bits of cotton had flown about like snowflakes.`
`But in Rosa's case, something like thick black tar came out, filthily flying all over the place.`
`There wasn't even a trace of the red of blood.`
`{n}......It was something black, filthy and thick.`
`It was probably what a bloodless, tearless human kept inside their body instead.`
`"This is incredible. Hideous!`
` What filthy insides...!`
` That was splendid, {f:5:Maria}.`
` Well then, is this enough for your revenge?`
` Can you forgive your mother, or not?`
` Innocent, or guilty...?!!"`
`"Can't forgive!!`
` Still can't forgive, guilty...!!!"`
`{f:5:Beatrice} brandished her pipe wand,`
` and a surge of gold butterflies regenerated Rosa's broken body in an instant...`
`".........kh, ......gh!`
` *cough*cough*......!"`
`"Feel your great sin, which cannot be paid for by a single human life.`
` And remember your own grievous sin...!`
` Come, try to remember...!!`
` Remember how great a sin you committed...!!"`
`.........Hello.`
` ......Is that you, Mama?`
` ......What time will you be back?`
`"I'm sorry.`
` I'm busy with work again today, so I'm staying over."`
`......Staying over at work again.........?`
` ......Your job's being hard on you again today, huh...`
`"Yeah, I'm sorry.`
` I really am busy.`
` I've been holed up at the company this whole time.`
` I can't even get a breath of outside air."`
`"Mama's job isn't one I can just finish up quick.`
` Unless I give them the best design I can, I won't be given another job...that's how tough this job is.`
` So it always needs a lot of time."`
`...Yeah.`
` Understand.`
` .........I'll be a good girl and watch over the house, so work really hard, finish it quickly, and come back home, okay......?`
`"Thank you for understanding about Mama's work......`
` I promise that I'll buy a delicious cake and bring it home with me tomorrow."`
`Don't need cake.`
` ......Instead of taking time to go to the cake store, I'd be happier if you just came home that little bit sooner.`
`"Don't worry.`
` I'll come back quickly, I promise.`
` So let's eat delicious cake together.`
` Let's drink delicious tea together.`
` Let's read a new picture book together.`
` Let's play with that "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle" I bought recently.`
` Both of us together.`
` ......It's a promise."`
`.........Yeah, promise.`
` I'll be waiting.`
` ............Do your best at work, Mama......`
`"Hohoh.`
` It's a lonely story, but this is good mother‐daughter love, with each showing consideration for the other, is it not?`
` Do you see any problem with it, Maria? Rosa?"`
`"..............................`
` ......Th‐that promise, ......I believe I kept it.`
` The next evening, didn't I do as I promised and return earlier than usual with the cake I bought?"`
`"That's not it, I knew......`
` .........That evening.`
` A pay‐on‐delivery package came for you, but there wasn't enough money in my wallet,`
` so I called your company to ask you what to do."`
`"......I'd been told only to call at special times,`
` ......but thought it'd be bad if the package was something important for your work...`
` So I called."`
`"...................................."`
`".........And when I did, they told me you had the day off.`
` ...They told me that it had been decided long ago that you would have the day off, .........and that you had gone far away to play.`
` ............I knew.`
` The whole, whole time, .........I knew that you were lying...!"`
`But you know what? ......Sakutaro scolded me, saying that wasn't true.`
`That Mama was very busy with her job every day.`
`That there was no way she would abandon me and play.`
`That the person who told me Mama had the day off must have made some kind of mistake...!`
`That's what Sakutaro said.`
`So I believed him.`
` ......I believed him!`
`I love Mama, I love Mama...!`
`And of course Mama loves me too, loves me too!!`
`"...............Yes.`
` Me too.`
` I love you, Maria......"`
`Rosa let out a deep sigh.`
`{n}......Maybe she felt the weight of her words.`
`Then, she set the receiver back on the bedside phone.`
`The dark room made the windowside view of the starry sky on the ground stand out even more beautifully.`
`On the table in front of that terrace was a very cold wine cooler,`
` and the one she was enjoying a glass with was gazing at the scene below...`
`".........You didn't tell your daughter that you were going on vacation?"`
`"I told her once, but she made such a fuss about it that I decided not to tell her anymore.`
` It's less of a pain that way."`
`"......If you're worried about your daughter, surely you didn't have to force this into your schedule?"`
`"But that way, we'd never get our schedules to match...`
` Didn't I say not to worry about that?"`
`The slender, middle‐aged man clad in a white robe gave a small sigh.`
`Rosa reacted sensitively to that slight action......`
`"Come on!`
` Let's not talk about my daughter.`
` It'd be a waste of this excellent wine."`
`"............I find you fascinating as both a woman and a human being.`
` But for that very reason,`
` I feel bad about taking so much of your time that it strains your relationship with your daughter."`
`"Aren't I always asking you not to worry about my relationship with my daughter...?!`
` I make sure not to talk about her when I'm alone with you, don't I?`
` I wouldn't even have phoned from up here if it weren't for the noisy drunks laughing stupidly in the lobby downstairs...!"`
`"Rosa‐san.`
` Couldn't you reconsider sudden vacations like this in the future, for your daughter's sake...?`
` Isn't it alright if we only do it when our schedules match?"`
`"But then our schedules won't match at all......!`
` Don't you understand, I......want to be with you all the time......!"`
`"That's how a child behaves when they're in love.`
` Love between adults should be a little more stoic.`
` ......Rosa‐san, I feel sad too that I can never stay with you for very long.`
` But I think we're enjoying a very full adult romance with the limited time and opportunities we have."`
`"So you're telling me to be with my daughter more.`
` ......Don't be a woman, be a mother?"`
`"......That's what you wish for too, isn't it?`
` You must want to spend some relaxed time with your daughter.`
` I'm not going anywhere.`
` I'm trying to say that I think it's sad for you to sacrifice your daughter so you can prioritize your time with me."`
`"........................................`
` ......Did you patch things up with your wife?`
` .........You've started thinking you don't want to split up, haven't you."`
`"I don't want to talk about my wife.`
` Just like you don't want to talk about your daughter."`
`"......You've started thinking that women with children are a pain."`
`"I have never said anything of the sort."`
`".........Whenever someone finds out I have a child, they desert me.`
` ......Even when I tell them they don't need to worry about the cost of raising her, they all desert me...`
` ......I...thought you understood about my daughter,`
` .........but it looks like you really don't like women with children......"`
`"That's not what I'm saying.`
` Of course I like you, Rosa‐san.`
` I'm just trying to say to take better care of your daughter—`
`you must want that yourself—so I don't want you to hurt yourself by lying to your daughter.`
` That's all I'm saying."`
`"Liar!!!`
` You just can't be bothered to deal with me any more, can you?!"`
`"I never said that...!"`
`"No, I know, I can tell.`
` After being abandoned so many times because of that child, I know,`
` I can tell by your mood, yes, you're the same, you're just like the other men!!`
` You don't want a woman with a child, you don't want a divorcee, you don't want to deal with it!!"`
`"You don't want to become the parent of a child made with another man, right?`
` No, of course you don't, I know exactly how that feels!!"`
`"I once went out with a man with children, and I absolutely understood that feeling...!!`
` That's why......I believed that I could be together with you, a person who understood about my daughter!!"`
`"Ghagh!!`
` *cough*, ......*cough*......`
` ......That's right......`
` You were......always in the way......"`
`".............................."`
`"......If not for you, ......I would have been able to grasp my happiness as a woman long ago......`
` Your existence......constantly gets in the way of my happiness......"`
`"............Ma...ma........."`
`".........Even I didn't want to give birth to you...`
` No, that's wrong.`
` ......I did think it'd be nice to build a happy family together with you...`
` ......But he disappeared right before you were born.`
` He said he'd build a warm family with me...he tricked me...and disappeared from my sight for all eternity...!!"`
`"Only you were left.`
` No love or memories or anything remained!!`
` Where is that man now?`
` He probably just turned my days with him into a warm memory, and found a new love.`
` And maybe that time he managed to build up a happy family...!!`
` And me?!`
` I have you!!`
` I can't even look for love!!"`
`"Men can go between women as they like and brag about it!`
` But the woman, me!!`
` {i:I} have {i:you}!!`
` I have you as a stone weight,`
` and because of you I can't search for romance, I can't have love, I have no choice but to live alone!!"`
`"No, I'm not even allowed that, I'm not even allowed a night to myself to drown my sorrows!!`
` Who are you?!`
` Who?!`
` You ruined my life, and won't even let me have a new one... Just what are you to my life?!"`
`"Die, disappear, I've hated you since the time you were born!!`
` I've hated you since the time you were in my womb!!!`
` But I tried to stay positive and accept you, I've been doing my best to play the part of a good mother."`
`"Yes, I did my best!!`
` As other women of my generation enjoyed being single, sometimes playing with passion, or even being joined with someone in love, I watched from the sidelines,`
` stuck wearing the two hats of a mother and a woman...!!`
` Who ever showed appreciation for my efforts?!`
` No one admired me, no one praised me!!"`
`"I got what I deserved?`
` You don't want a woman with a kid?`
` Sour grapes?`
` You're looking for a girl who's sweet and pure?!`
` Well who the hell wants YOU, you goddamn inexperienced punks!!!"`
`"I was so desperate, I probably looked like I'd fall for you easy... Yes, damn right I was desperate!!`
` I'm still at the age where I want to know love,`
` and I was being swamped with work and caring for my child, and when I realized that I would probably grow old and live out my life like this,`
` you can't even imagine how desperate I was!!"`
`"Of course I hate your real father too!`
` But he and I both share the blame for bringing about that breakup.`
` I myself might have been enough of a pain in the ass to make him run away!"`
`"But the breakups after that, all of them were your fault!`
` When did I ever scold you for that?!`
` Never, did I?!?!?!"`
`"The day after one man left me, when I wanted to drink myself dead drunk, was Parent's Day at your school!!`
` I was there, my tear‐stained eyes disguised with heavy makeup,`
` and the way I felt when you said something off the mark and the whole class laughed at you...`
`is something I expect you and everyone else on this planet couldn't possibly understand!!"`
`"I hate you, loathe you...!!!`
` And up to this very moment, I've never really loved you even once!!!`
` Whhaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaahhhhh!!!"`
`Maria's face was frozen......`
`If words really were blades,`
` ......Maria's whole body would probably have been stained red with fresh blood by now.`
`Even after gaining the power of a witch and resolving herself to take revenge for Sakutaro,`
` ......she couldn't stand these curses coming out of her mother's mouth...`
`"............Ma.........ma..................`
`.....uuuwau......`
`uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!!"`
`"Ugly.`
` Aaaaaaaahh, how ugly is a woman drowning in lust...!!`
` This is this woman's true nature!!`
` Even I, as a thousand‐year‐old witch who has explored the depths of evil, find this most difficult to watch!!"`
`"Aaah, {f:5:Maria}, now is the time for you and her to part ways!!`
` Smash the ugly lump of meat that calls herself your mother...!!`
` There is no meaning in your pure soul being bound any longer by the chains of parent and child!`
` With your own hand,`
` release your own soul now!!`
` You have now gained the teeth and claws to protect yourself!!"`
`"Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!`
` Now I'll make you learn all the days of pain I went through...!`
` I'll get revenge for my days of suffering...!!!"`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Aren't you the one who's been making me suffer?!`
` I'm the one who wants revenge...!!"`
`"I should have done that before you were born!!`
` I should never have given birth to you!!`
` Get out of my liiiiiife, uaaaoo{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaahhhh!!"`
`"......ggyah—"`
`As Rosa howled, her upper body was crushed in a way that can only be described by the word "splat",`
` and in an instant, was turned into something similar to a wrung, blood‐stained towel.`
`"Get crushed.`
` Can't forgive, ......can't forgive...!!"`
`"Kuhhahhahha......!!`
` You filth.`
` That form suits you...!"`
`......Even though everything from Rosa's waist downwards was upright as normal,`
` the upper half of her body alone was crushed; the extreme difference was altogether bizarre.`
`Then she fell over—but her body was regenerated the instant she fell.`
`"*cough*cough*!`
` *cough*!!`
` .........{i:You} die.`
` ......Kuhhi{0}hi{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hhi......!"`
`"Come, Maria.`
` Is this all there is to your anger and sadness?`
` Now is the time for revenge!`
` Time for the settlement of anger and sadness...!!"`
`"Take it out on her, spit it out at her!!`
` Push out all of the wedges that have been driven into your chest, and fling them back!!!"`
`"Uugaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhoooooooooooooohhhh!!!"`
`Maria's howl was colored by the ugly sound of flesh and bone being simultaneously crushed...`
`As Rosa, who had foully insulted Maria, lay spread‐eagled,`
` a neat, perfectly circular area of her chest was squashed into a pulp, as though it had been trampled by an invisible elephant.`
`Her heart and her lungs and her ribs were trampled so mercilessly that they were completely indistinguishable.`
`......That might have symbolized the pain in Maria's heart up until today.`
`"So, Maria.`
` Are you now satisfied?`
` Can you forgive your mother's sin?`
` Or not?`
` Innocent?`
` Or guilty?!"`
`"Can't forgive!!`
` Still can't forgive, can't forgive at all!!`
` Mama is guilty, guilty guilty guilty, can't forgive!!!"`
`"Naturally, how could your days of anguish be equalled by this level of punishment?!!`
` You will learn, Rosa!`
` Come, try to remember, what form did you have?!`
` Revive in order to be killed!!`
` Be killed in order to purify your sins, over and over!!!"`
`Beato waved her wand, her body was regenerated again,`
` and Rosa sat up, coughing violently in pain...`
`And once again, she spat out curses rejecting Maria.`
`".........You aren't Mama.`
` You're a witch, a witch tormenting me and Mama!!`
` I won't forgive you just because you look like Mama!`
` Won't forgive you!!"`
`"......You're the witch......`
` Always reading creepy books and playing witches...!!`
` You're the one who should disappear!!!!!!!`
` Because of you, even I get treated like a weirdo!`
` Because of you, because of yoo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ou{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}uuu!!!"`
`"I should never have given birth to you!!`
` I wish you had never been born...!!`
` I hated you since before you were boo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooorn!!!"`
`"UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH...!!!"`
`.........Maria screamed.`
`Was she unable to bear her anger and sadness?`
`{n}Or else, was she taken over by an indescribable emotion......?`
`It was surely...a cry of hopelessness.`
`And yet, this was the reality that had to be accepted.`
`Even Maria knew.`
`{n}She had known that she was thought of as a nuisance.`
`But even though she knew it, she did not believe it.`
`She believed that she was loved by her mother, and all the various events that should have made her doubt this,`
` she did her utmost to interpret in a positive light, trusting and clinging to her mother's love.`
`But.........she had no one except her mama.`
`Despite all this, she really did love her mama,`
` ......and wanted to return to the days when she could still believe that her mama loved her too......`
`So she howled...`
`She brought everything to nothing.`
` She would not accept it.`
` She denied it.`
`She denied the black witch making her mother say such things,`
` and.........the part of herself that couldn't forgive that mother......!!!`
`But she couldn't deny it!`
`This was reality, fact, truth, the answer.`
`Unmistakable, absolute......reality!!`
`Maria turned Rosa into a lump of meat over and over.`
`In the dark world that reflected her heart, over and over it echoed:`
` that ugly sound which would make one want to cover their ears, of flesh and bone being torn apart......`
`Each time, {f:5:Beatrice} revived Rosa.`
`She dragged her back into the world of endless torture, from which even death was no escape.`
`This was the true deepest hell that the Endless Witch {f:5:Beatrice} could create.`
`However, this world was not made endless by {f:5:Beatrice}'s will.`
`......Because every time Rosa turned into a lump of meat, {f:5:Beatrice} asked the same question of Maria.`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Are you satisfied, {f:5:Maria}?!`
` Can your anger forgive your mother?!"`
`"No way, no way!!`
` Won't forgive, won't forgive!!"`
`"I'll teach you all of my pain...!!`
` Teach you much, much more...!!`
` Still not enough, not close to enough...!!`
` Since I was born, since before I was born...!!`
` I can't erase the anger and sadness of being despised for all that time......!!"`
`".........Fuhi...hahaha......`
` ......I hate you, haaate you...`
` Fuhihiha...haha......"`
`"UGaAAAAAAAAAaaAAAAAAAaaaAAHHHH!!!"`
`Again and again she revived her.`
` Again and again she returned her to a lump of meat.`
`In all kinds of ways, she crushed her, smashed her, beat her, and tore her to bits.`
`{n}Flying blood spatter and flesh had by now turned the once pitch‐black world into a mix of red and black.`
`Maria's anger was still not settling down.`
`It was as though she was disgorging all of the rage she had suppressed from the time of her birth until today.`
`If all that was poison to her heart...`
`Then would the repeated murder of her mother purify her soul...?`
`Could these pointless atrocities save her soul even just a little bit......?`
`This endless torture...might have started serving as a slight diversion from her sad, unrewarded life.`
`After all, ......it seemed that she had finally been able to regain her smile.`
`"Learn it!!`
` You, the source of my unhappiness!!`
` Learn it!!`
` Learn that my pain is greater than this!!`
` Kihhihiha{0}hha{0}ha{0}haha!!"`
`"What's wrong?`
` Aren't you going to laugh anymore?!`
` Try and laaaaa{-}a{-}aauuugh!!"`
`"......Fuhi...fuhihihi......`
` Gyablkk...!!!"`
`Half of her skull collapsed.`
`{n}Eyeballs flew out, and black cranial fluid gushed.`
`{n}Fragments of teeth scattered.`
`"Come on, revive...!!`
` Try and laugh...!!`
` Come on, come oooooon!!!"`
`"............Hih......hih.`
` ......Ghaggh—!!"`
`Her whole chest along with her ribs turned inside out, spewing her filthy innards everywhere around her.`
`All of them writhed, looking like some kind of foul creature.`
`"Come on come on come on!!`
` Revive!!`
` Can you still laugh?`
` Can you still laugh?!`
` Kihhihihihihi?!"`
`".............................."`
`Rosa couldn't let out a laugh anymore.`
`{n}......But her face was laughing.`
`It was covered with a twisted laugh, which was filled with a malice that rejected her unwanted daughter.`
`I erased that laughing voice.`
`{n}Next, I'll erase that laughing face.`
`I'll erase it, I'll crush it, I'll tear it to bits...!!`
`"Laugh, try and laugh, Mama...!!`
` Kihhihihihihha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha?!`
` What's wrong, Mama, wake up, read me a picture book, let's go take a walk...!!`
` Tell me you love me, make a promise for next Sunday, let's go shopping, let's go to the movies...!!`
` And then of course break that promise anyway!!"`
`"Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihi, isn't it fun, Mama, isn't it fun? I'm playing with you now!!`
` Kihhihha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!!"`
`"That's right, you are now playing with your mother, having fun with her...!!`
` Tell me your emotions now!`
` I believe they should not be of anger or sadness or pain...!"`
`"Yeah, you're right, I can feel it, {f:5:Beatrice}...!!`
` I'm having so much fun now... I'm playing with Mama, so it's tons of fun!!"`
`"And even though I'm killing Mama over and over again, I can bring her back to life with just a single bit of magic!!`
` I took care of my toys because I couldn't fix them if they broke...!!`
` But if the toys could be fixed, I'd want to break them over and over again!!`
` Kihhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!!`
` Hihihihihihi, hihi........."`
`"......But, ............Sakutaro won't be fixed.`
` ...He can't be fixed.........`
` .........Because Mama, who made him,`
` ......Mama, who gave birth to him,`
` ......won't accept him."`
`".............................."`
`"I'm not accepted by Mama either, am I...`
` .........So the broken Maria can't be fixed anymore either.`
` .............................."`
`".........Kihihihi.`
` Kihhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!!`
` Kyah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaahhh, it's fun, it's so much fun, Mama...!!`
` I'm having so much fun that somehow, I'm starting to feel like I could forgive you...!"`
`"Hey, Beato, this is a reeeeally strange emotion...!`
` Why?`
` Why have I started to feel like I could forgive Mama?!"`
`"That is the enlightened state that is only reached by witches who have gained the power to control life and death at will.`
` ......You can kill her at any time.`
` You can bring her back to life if needed.`
` If she becomes a pain, then you can simply kill her once more...!"`
`"Once you've learned that you can do this at any time simply by snapping your fingers, the nonsense of the human realm, all of it becomes unworthy of lending an ear to, of less importance than the chirping of insects...!"`
`"You began to feel like forgiving your mother not because your eyes were opened to your mother's love.`
` It was because now, as of that moment!`
` You stand at the entrance to the world of true witches...!!`
` Welcome, Maria, to the profound and sweet world of witches!!"`
`"I've done it...!!`
` I'm not Maria any more...!!`
` Still an apprentice, maybe, but I've surpassed the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world...!"`
`"Now, I'm the Apprentice Witch of Origins, {f:5:Maria}......!!!`
` There's nothing to make me feel bitter, nothing to make me sad!"`
`"Mama, I'll forgive you.`
` I'm sure I can forgive you!`
` I think I'll be able to forgive you after doing just a little bit more!!"`
`"After all, I am a witch!!`
` Ki......hihhi{0}hi{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hhihhi!"`
`"Kihhihihih!!!"`
`Maria probably would forgive her mother eventually.`
`{n}......After brutally murdering her countless times.`
` Generously.`
`".........Whoa, that last thunderbolt was huge.`
` Must be pretty close, don't you think?"`
`"It sounds like it.`
` No matter how old you get, thunder still makes you jump."`
`Battler was looking at the dark night through a crack in the curtains.`
`{n}Every once in a while, a pale white lightning bolt would light up the sky, and he seemed to be enjoying it.`
`"......................................."`
`"......Oh?`
` Please, Battler, you're making so much noise that Maria's woken up now.`
` Sorry, Maria.`
` Sorry Battler's so noisy...!"`
`"What the heck, it's my fault?`
` Sorry, Maria.`
` You can go back to sleep.`
` Night‐night."`
`Maria was looking a bit hazy, with drowsy eyes.`
`{n}......She was probably still half‐asleep, and couldn't think straight.`
`".....................Uu.`
` ......Had enough.`
` Won't sleep."`
`"It's OK, sleep.`
` You're still half‐asleep right now.`
` Ihihi."`
`"......Not half‐asleep!`
` ............Uu!!"`
`"Oh come on, you're blatantly half‐asleep.`
` Lie back down, lie back down."`
`"Not half‐asleep! Not half‐asleep!!`
` Uu‐uu!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Quit it, Battler, you dumbass...!`
` Ugh, god, what are you thinking, getting a kid who's just woken up into a bad mood...!"`
`"Not half‐asleep!`
` Not half‐asleep!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`"I understand, Maria‐chan...`
` You aren't half‐asleep.`
` So calm down......"`
`"Not half‐asleep not half‐asleep!!`
` Uu!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`Maybe it was because of her dubious mental state after waking up, but Maria suddenly threw a tantrum.`
`In Battler's mind, he had only been teasing her a little bit,`
` so he was taken aback by this extreme overreaction.`
`George hugged her and held her head, trying to calm her down, but Maria's tantrum wasn't quelled easily.`
`Battler and Jessica were trying to push the blame on each other, saying "It's your fault", "It's your fault too".`
`"Hey, be quiet, you two...!`
` Jessica‐chan, there was still some hot water in the pot, right?`
` Could you make some tea for her?`
` .........Did you calm down?`
` Maria‐chan."`
`"...............Uuuu."`
`It looked like her tantrum was dying down bit by bit,`
` but she was still glaring at Battler, who had made fun of her, with sharp eyes.`
`"Battler‐kun was just messing around.`
` He doesn't really think you're half‐asleep.`
` So calm down.`
` Alright?`
` ........................?"`
`"...................................."`
`George noticed.`
` ......Maria was staring at Battler with incredible eyes.`
`And, ......despite having just displayed all that emotion, ......she laughed in a small voice.`
`{a:c:`
`Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.}`
`Instead of a laugh, it seemed more like she was muttering while savoring,`
` or else counting, each "hi".`
`As though each time she said "hi", she was making something brutal happen over and over.`
`George felt something creepy for a split second,`
` ......but he wasn't able to notice the madness that, for a brief moment, peeked out of the depths of the girl's eyes.`
`After remaining spaced out for a short period of time,`
` Maria stopped her bizarre quiet laugh, and pushed George's arm aside, as though telling him to let go.`
`".........Uu.`
` Forgive him."`
`"R‐really?`
` You're such a good girl, Maria‐chan.`
` ......Battler‐kun, Maria‐chan forgave you.`
` Make up with her."`
`"Uhh, sorry for teasing you.`
` Forgive me..."`
`"Here you go, Maria...`
` We made you café au lait to show we've made up with you.`
` It's got lots of sugar in, so it's sweet."`
`"Don't want it.`
` But forgive you.`
` ............Because I'm a witch.`
` ...Kihihihi."`
`One more time, Maria laughed in a creepy, quiet voice.`
`But it was only for a very short time, so Battler and Jessica didn't think much of it.`
`......They decided to think that, probably,`
` it had only looked that way for an instant, when a flash of lightning had lit up her cheek with a pale, white light.`
`Then, they heard the sound of loud and hasty footsteps rushing towards them from the hall.`
`It was already about half past ten at night.`
`{n}A time that could safely be called "late at night".`
`Hearing footsteps like that at this time was not very peaceful...`
`Then, along with a clearly disquieting and wild series of knocks, they heard Gohda's and Kumasawa's voices.`
`......That clearly told them that this was an abnormal situation.`
`"Children...!!`
` Are you there? Are you there?!`
` It's Gohda!"`
`"It's Kumasawa, is everyone alright?!`
` Aaaaaaah, what shall I do, what shall I do...!"`
`When George opened the door, the two of them tumbled in, sopping wet.`
`It looked like they had dashed here from the mansion without an umbrella.`
`"Wh‐what's gotten into you two......`
` What's happened......?!"`
`"I‐it was, it was...!!`
` Th‐th‐the Master—{nobr:Krauss‐sama}—{nobr:everyone, he}—`
`awawa{0}wa{0}wa{0}wa{0}wa{0}wawawa..."`
`......It was......a pitch‐black room.`
`There were no windows, and by the light from the weak bulb, one could only just barely make out the state of things around them.`
`It appeared to be an old, forgotten, dusty underground storehouse, with some kind of furniture haphazardly thrown into it......`
`However, even with just a little light, one could at least tell that it probably wasn't a storehouse.`
`......Because that room was sealed off with iron bars.`
`"......Where...is this.........?"`
`"Not a clue...`
` ......Is this place underneath the mansion......?`
` Was there this kind of room......directly underneath the dining hall......?"`
`They had been dropped into what had appeared to be a pit, and {i:fallen} into this room.`
`Therefore, it would be appropriate to think that this room was directly below the dining hall.`
`......However, not even Krauss could bring himself to believe that there were pitfalls rigged in the beloved dining hall, where he had enjoyed his meals for years,`
` ...and that directly below it was this dungeon‐like room.`
`But the ceiling, when they looked up, was made of rugged stone, ......and they could not understand from where in that ceiling they could have fallen.`
`No, all five people who had been dropped here thought the same thing.`
`Although they had felt a sensation of being dropped into a pit,`
` ......there was no way there could be pitfalls in the dining hall, nor could this dungeon‐like place be directly underneath it.`
`......But, in point of fact, they {i:had} fallen into this place, and were locked in.`
`{n}......And so, ...they were confused.`
`"......It is lucky that no one was hurt after falling from such a height..."`
`".........Shannon, Kanon.`
` Did either of you two know about this room...?"`
`"......No.`
` We also have no knowledge of any room like this."`
`"..................Really...?"`
`"R‐really......`
` We really......don't know any room like this......"`
`It seemed that Kyrie thought that there was a good chance that, despite their age,`
` they might know of the mansion's secret tricks as servants permitted the One‐winged Eagle.`
`There was a long silence, as if evaluating their answer...`
`"......No, it's probably true that they don't know.`
` Shannon is a very tidy person, after all."`
`"If she had known about this room, it would probably have been scrubbed until it was sparkling.`
` The filth of this room is proof that you two don't know of it.`
` ......More importantly than that, I think we should worry about what to do now, don't you?"`
`"E‐exactly......`
` We need to call the police...o‐or rather, call for medical assistance as soon as possible......"`
`Nanjo's words rang hollow.`
`...Obviously.`
`Six people had been killed in the dining hall.`
`{n}They had all witnessed the exact moments when the six had been killed.`
`And what's more, it had been done by half‐destroying their heads—`
`anyone could tell with just a single glance that they had been dealt a fatal injury.`
`Everyone understood that calling for an ambulance now would be completely meaningless......`
`"Thank you, Doctor Nanjo.`
` ......We already understand that our partners are no longer alive.`
` .........Thanks for trying to console us by mentioning medical assistance."`
`".........Natsuhi......`
` .............................."`
`Once again, an oppressive silence took control of them.`
`But Krauss shook his head harshly over and over, and decided just for now to forget the pain of losing his wife,`
` and dedicate himself to figuring out where they were.`
`"Everyone, listen to me.`
` ...............Dad is...`
`.........beyond hope now.`
` ...The time for words, and seeking comprehension or an explanation...`
`is long past."`
`Nobody answered.`
`......Without any kind of discussion or mercy, six people had been killed in an instant.`
`And Kinzo had so boldly proclaimed for them to become sacrifices in a thirteen‐person murder ritual.`
`......Since they had been locked up in this place,`
` they too would probably become the ritual's next sacrifices before long.`
`Around this time, their eyes were becoming used to the darkness,`
` and, bit by bit, they were starting to be able to make out the dungeon's interior.`
`......What they thought was furniture haphazardly left in the dungeon turned out not to be furniture at all.`
`They were......small cages that could be used to imprison a single person, restraining tables, ......or were those torture racks?`
`.....At any rate, it was obviously more ghastly than a mere jail cell.`
`Since those objects were rusted and covered in thick layers of dust, there was no doubt that they had been long‐forgotten.`
`......Maybe you could even have called those things Kinzo's sealed and forgotten madness.`
`However, it was this room in which they had now been locked away.`
`.........Those objects weren't exactly comforting to people who were locked up,`
` hoping to be released without harm...`
`"......Anyway, let's get out of here.`
` We've lost loved ones and friends and would like to spend some time shedding tears,`
` but more than that, ......I'm worried about the children."`
`".........I, ...I wonder if the children are safe......"`
`"All we can do is pray...`
` ......Come to think of it, Kumasawa‐san and Gohda‐san aren't here."`
`"Perhaps they were able to...get away safely..."`
`"You never know.`
` It'd be a relief if they were able to meet up with the children..."`
`"Gohda‐san can be relied upon in times of crisis, and Kumasawa‐san is knowledgeable and calm...`
` I'm sure they would be helpful to the children..."`
`"......Hahaha.`
` I hope so."`
`Shannon and Krauss smiled bitterly a little.`
` But they quickly realized how improper that was, and stopped, clearing their throats.`
`".........We can't be too optimistic, Nee‐san.`
` There's a chance that they have already been attacked, after we were."`
`"I agree.`
` What Father carried out in the dining hall was...`
`...the six murders of the first twilight from the witch's epitaph, right?`
` Then, the second twilight is to "tear apart the two who are close"."`
`"......We can't deny the possibility that Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san may have already been killed, having run away to hide together in close company.`
` .........We can't cling to the optimistic idea that they definitely got to the guesthouse and are protecting the children."`
`Kyrie coldly analyzed the worst‐case scenario.`
`Even for her, it was heartbreaking to have lost her beloved husband.`
`{n}......But right now, the most important thing was protecting that husband's son,`
` along with the other children, from becoming sacrifices to the insane family head.`
`She overcame her sadness with the parental urge to protect the children.`
`......It seemed that both Kyrie and Krauss were strong enough to forget their grief, if only for the time being...`
`They could let their tears flow later.`
`......For now, in order to protect the children, they had to act.`
`"Anyway, let's get out of here...`
` It seems to be a rather old cell.`
` Couldn't we break the bars somehow?`
` Let's try searching the entire room for some way to escape."`
`"There's all kinds of junk around here. I wonder if there are any tools lying around that we could use.`
` There might be something that we could use as a weapon, or something that we could use to break the bars."`
`Kyrie pulled a lighter from her pocket.`
`She herself didn't smoke, but she kept one tucked away in her pocket to light Rudolf's cigarettes.`
`......It was an extremely valuable source of light for searching through this dim dungeon.`
`"Shannon, help Kyrie‐san search the room.`
` Kanon, you'll help me check out the bars.`
` This is a very old cell.`
` The bars could be loose."`
`"Wh‐what should I help with......?"`
`"Please just keep up your strength.`
` ......Father will probably come here before long.`
` You're the only one whose words will reach him.`
` In a way, you might be holding our lives in your hands."`
`"......My words...will no longer reach him, I think.`
` I'm sorry, but I don't believe I will be of any use......"`
`"Then lend us your expertise as a doctor.`
` .........I wonder if there is a drug that makes people instantly faint?"`
`"......A drug that makes people instantly faint......?`
` What are you talking about......?"`
`"We believe we fell through a pit, and landed in this dungeon.`
` ......In that panic‐stricken place, that's what we believed happened."`
`"......But looking at how large this room is, I came to a realization.`
` This dungeon cannot be underneath the dining hall."`
`"How can you tell that it can't...?"`
`"............You're an idiot, Nee‐san.`
` This dungeon is too narrow compared to the dining hall."`
`"Exactly.`
` The first person to fall was Krauss nii‐san.`
` The second was myself.`
` When you fell into this room, did you move from that spot, Krauss nii‐san?"`
`"......It's embarrassing to say, but I lay there groaning in pain from the landing.`
` Immediately after that, you came crashing down next to me."`
`"The distance between us as we stood in the dining hall, compared to where we landed, is clearly strange."`
`"C‐...certainly, when you put it that way.`
` ......I was the next to fall, so I remember fairly well where you two were standing.`
` ......The distance between you two in the dining hall might have been greater than this entire room."`
`"We fell into a pit, and directly dropped down here.`
` ......It's not like we fell into multiple intersecting pipes, and were all collected together before falling down here."`
`"The fall was instant, wasn't it?`
` I don't remember rolling around in some sort of elaborate water pipe system."`
`"............Indeed, we can't explain that with a pitfall.`
` ...How strange."`
`"What does that have to do with......the drug that makes people instantly faint that Kyrie‐sama was talking about...?"`
`"...........................`
` ......Kyrie‐sama is probably thinking that there were no pitfalls in the dining hall, I would guess."`
`"But we did actually fall."`
`"To put it accurately, we had the feeling that we fell into a pit.`
` ......It's only natural.`
` That's the only way we could describe such an experience."`
`"I, I see......`
` In other words, this is what you're getting at..."`
`"......We were not dropped into a pit,`
` ......but shot, for example, with something like a blowdart, lost consciousness instantly, and the instant we fell to the floor,`
` it could be that we just remember that as though we fell into a pit......"`
`"............I see.`
` That's a much more persuasive explanation than there being numerous pitfall traps in the dining hall that we've never noticed, even after decades eating there."`
`"......Nee‐san.`
` Do you have a watch?"`
`"Huh?`
` .........Y‐...yes.`
` I have a pocket watch.`
` .........Umm, it's about twenty to eleven."`
`".........Yes.`
` My watch says the same.`
` ...In short, it hasn't been more than ten minutes since that chaos in the dining hall."`
`"My watch likewise.`
` ............That's much too short a time to knock us out and carry us somewhere.`
` .........Judging only from the time, it's reasonable to think that we did fall through a hole leading directly underneath the dining hall."`
`"Watch hands are easily tampered with.`
` ......While we were passed out, they may have wound everyone's watch back.`
` We are incapable of proving that this possibility doesn't exist."`
`"...........................`
` Whether a pitfall, or else a drug that induces fainting,`
` ......it does not change the fact that we need to be on our guard..."`
`"......So, Doctor Nanjo?`
` Is there a drug that can do that?"`
`"Well, ............`
` ......It's the same as your logic, Kyrie‐san.`
` ...I cannot prove that there is not a drug with that effect of which I do not know."`
`"......As they say, you can never be too careful.`
` ...Sorry, it was a pointless question.`
` Except, I think that with my hypothesis, I was able to suggest that this dungeon is not necessarily directly underneath the dining hall."`
`"I see...`
` .......There's always the possibility that we were carried off to a dungeon in Father's hidden mansion,`
` which is rumored to be hidden somewhere in the middle of the vast forest.`
` ......If we can escape from here and get outside, then we'll know.`
` We can save worrying about that until after we get out."`
`"Exactly.`
` I'm truly sorry.`
` I've only been asking and inquiring into useless things."`
`"No, it's quite reassuring.`
` Please continue to tell us if you notice anything else.`
` It might become a hint to escaping from here."`
`".........I always heard from Rudolf.`
` He was always surprised by your ideas, and they would sometimes serve as valuable hints.`
` ......The fact that you're here is a blessing within a tragedy."`
`"......Thank you.`
` Rudolf‐san told me something about you, as well.`
` He said that you usually act big, but when things get serious, you overflow with a sense of responsibility, and are a very dependable older brother."`
`"Hahaha... That's too kind.`
` .........Dammit, these iron bars won't even budge.`
` How are things on your end, Kanon?"`
`".........No luck here either, I'm afraid."`
`Krauss and Kanon tried wiggling each of the bars in various ways.`
`......There were a few bars that could be twisted,`
` and a few felt like they had enough room to rattle around a little bit,`
` but even so, they could not be broken with human strength alone.`
`......However, there was still hope if they could use some kind of lever‐like tool.`
`It was still far too early to give up yet.`
`The children's lives were hanging in the balance.`
` ......Even if there was no hope, they couldn't stop their struggle.`
`And it was better even for them to act this way.`
`......If they were to stop...there was no doubt that they would once again be overcome by the grief of losing their loved ones, and crouch down, clutching their knees......`
`"How are you doing, Kyrie‐san?`
` Found anything?"`
`"......I've found some stones small enough to hide in a clenched fist.`
` Even this might work as a weapon.`
` Though, I'm sure it'd be impossible to whittle down those iron bars.`
` How about you, Shannon‐chan...?"`
`"No, nothing."`
`".........Ah, this is...`
`............a phone."`
`"There's no way it's connected.`
` ......But, we might be able to use the cord for tying something up or as some form of weapon.`
` If we break it and take it apart, we could take out the metal parts.`
` Krauss nii‐san, there is a keyhole for opening the cell, right?"`
`"Yeah.`
` It's a pretty large hole, quite old fashioned.`
` ......If we twist some wire into it, we just might be able to pick it."`
`"We might be able to use the metal parts of the phone as a substitute for something.`
` ......This phone will become our weapon."`
`"It's the same as investing.`
` Information is our weapon."`
`Krauss and Kyrie laughed together at this way of putting the phone to use, which didn't remotely look at it as a means of communication.`
`"............What are you doing, Nee‐san."`
`"Ah, ......um, ...I just wondered if maybe...the phone was w‐working......"`
`"............({i:whisper}) You dummy, Nee‐san."`
`"Huh...?`
` .........What?"`
`Suddenly, Shannon let out a small surprised cry.`
`"K‐Kyrie‐sama...!`
` .....This phone, it's connected."`
`"What did you say...?"`
`It was like when people move out of an office, taking everything with them, leaving only the telephone behind—`
`that's the feeling the phone gave off, having been left in the corner of the cell.`
`The cord was wound into a coil, one end of it being swallowed by the wall,`
` and at a glance, it looked as if it could plausibly be connected.`
`......But, to think that it actually was...`
`Kyrie took the receiver from Shannon and pressed it to her ear.`
`{n}The electric hum was certainly the one with which she was familiar.`
`{n}......This phone was indeed live.`
`"Wh‐...what good luck...!`
` Let's contact the police...!"`
`"Hold on...!`
` This is too good to be true.`
` Should we not suspect that it's bugged...?!"`
`"If they were planning a trick like that, normally they would cut the telephone line.`
` ......There's a good possibility that they actually overlooked this."`
`"If they notice, the line might actually be cut for real.`
` There's nothing that we could tell the police that would be problematic for us if they overheard."`
`......That did make sense.`
` The point of a wiretap was to overhear some important piece of information,`
` but the way things were now, they could not think of a single thing that would come up in a conversation to the outside world that could be troublesome to have heard.`
`Kyrie instantly concluded that it was more likely to be a mistake on Kinzo's part than a trap......`
`"Y‐...you do have a point......`
` I believe that you start with 0 to make calls to the outside......"`
`"Kanon‐kun, I'm going to make a phone call, so will you watch how things are out there for me?`
` If you sense somebody coming, let me know."`
`"Y‐yes......!"`
`Kanon raced off towards the iron bars, silenced his breathing, and strained his ears......`
`{n}As everyone present watched her, Kyrie dialed {ruby:the police:110}...`
`However, she pushed the hook down repeatedly and redialed.`
`......It didn't seem to be working very well.`
`".........The outside line begins with 0?`
` 110 would be 0110 then, right?`
` It doesn't seem to want to go through..."`
`"Hand it over here, I'll try to call......`
` ..........................."`
`Krauss took the receiver in Kyrie's place, and tested various things......`
`But in the end, they were unable to notify the police......`
`The phone itself was definitely live, but the circuit was apparently cut somewhere.`
`......Did this mean that "they" were not so naive?`
`"......So it's useless after all......"`
`"So our enemy is no pushover...`
` ........................"`
`Kyrie let out a deep sigh, leaned against the wall, and hung her head for a while.`
`As tough a girl as she was, for a brief moment, she might actually have had the naive hope that the phone could actually work.`
`......She sneered at herself mockingly for holding onto that naive hope for even one moment.`
`And then, ......she thought back upon just what was happening here.`
`......Honestly...despite having been shown such a thing right before her eyes, ......or rather, exactly because of that...`
`......she still could not think of that gruesome mass murder as something real...`
`{n}It was less that she couldn't believe it, and more that she didn't want to.`
`Ushiromiya Kinzo had killed six members of his family.`
`He had summoned strange, witch‐like, demon‐like people,`
` ......right out of thin air, ......`
`.........and with something like magic,`
` ......he had begun to kill people one after another..........`
`...........................`
`Too much to handle.`
` ......Even though she definitely saw it, there was no way she could accept that spectacle......`
`".........There's no way that's what happened.`
` .........Those were obviously Grandfather's friends, or something.`
` ......They were just hiding somewhere in the dining hall beforehand, and used some trick to appear suddenly and surprise us.`
` .........There's no other way to explain something as screwed up as that."`
`But when those six had had their heads blown apart, a golden arrow had flown around and around the room.`
`......That had truly looked like...`
`...magic.`
`Was that another thing we just saw wrong?`
`{n}There's no way it was magic.`
` There must be some kind of trick to it.`
`......Since it was capable of smashing heads, there's no doubt it was some explosive.`
`For example, a styrene toy plane like they sell at candy stores, painted gold,`
` and with a powerful explosive loaded onto the end of it.`
`.......That said, at a glance, it had seemed to be flying at random;`
` Kyrie couldn't imagine that such a thing could be fired six times, and each time perfectly hit the victim square in the head, one after the other.`
`Surely its flight wasn't computer‐controlled to seek out and deliver precise hits on its targets,`
` which would make it a high‐tech styrene plane on the same level as a guided missile...?`
`".........Would he invest such a large amount of money into developing some stupid trick like that?`
` ......For that insane entertainment......?`
` Does this come back to the old "I wouldn't put it past Father"......?"`
`A number of mysterious people had appeared suddenly out of thin air,`
` ......six people had had their heads demolished by a mysterious golden flying object,`
` ......and the five of us were locked away in a mysterious dungeon by a mysterious set of pitfalls, or else put to sleep by some fainting poison dart......`
`The family conference started a bit after 10 p.m.`
`{n}......It's only been about thirty minutes since then.`
`Probably,`
` those events, which took place in such a short amount of time,`
` ......none of us are able to understand, nor come to grips with, even though we witnessed them ourselves.`
`Even if we did get ahold of the police,`
` it would probably be impossible for any of us to accurately explain what we saw......`
`I may only just have witnessed it,`
` ......but my brain's fried, and I have no confidence even in what I myself saw...`
`Kyrie had to try her hardest to rouse herself from her overwhelming confusion, just to hold onto her sanity......`
`"Dammit......what's going on here,`
` ......damn, ...dammit...!"`
`Krauss started to become desperate, hitting the hook multiple times, and redialing over and over.`
`......He too was feigning composure, but was unable to hide his panic.`
`The more he redialed, the more the pretense of serenity peeled away...`
`None of this makes any sense......`
`Kyrie couldn't help but pray that the events that had just occurred were no more than a dream...`
`.........Suddenly, the look on Krauss's face changed.`
`"Uh, o......oh...!`
` I got through, I got through...!`
` It's ringing...!"`
`"R‐really, Krauss‐san...?!"`
`"Yes, I see it now, the old man was shortsighted...!`
` It seems that he cut the external line in an effort to prevent us from contacting the police, but he missed out on severing the internal line...!"`
`"Internal line?`
` Krauss‐san, where did you call...?!"`
`"The guesthouse.`
` I'm calling the room where Jessica and the rest are staying...!"`
`"......Ah?!`
` Hello!`
` Hello?!`
` It's me...!`
` Who is this...?!`
` Gohda?!`
` Is Jessica there, is she safe...?!!"`
`"K‐Krauss‐sama......!!`
` I'm so glad you're safe...!!`
` Yes!`
` Milady Jessica and the other children are here as well, safe and unharmed...!"`
`"Dad!!`
` Is that you, Dad?!`
` I'm so glad you're okay......!!`
` Is Mom okay?!`
` Is she there?!"`
`".........M‐......"`
`Krauss choked on his words.`
`......Krauss had clearly seen Natsuhi's head crushed, had seen her killed right before his eyes......`
`Eventually, he was going to have to tell that to Jessica.`
`......However, Krauss began to fret over whether he should tell her this very moment, and lost his words.`
`......But even that was an answer under these circumstances......`
`"......I don't know about her......`
` ......Let's pray she's safe.`
` ...For now, I'm just glad you're safe."`
`"...........................Yeah.`
` ......I understand.`
` .........I'm sorry for......asking."`
`Jessica's voice was filled with tears...`
` ......There was no doubt for Krauss anymore.`
`{n}Jessica and the others had been told everything, start to finish, by Gohda and Kumasawa when they had met up at the guesthouse...`
`After they learned that six whole people had been killed,`
` Jessica and the others must have been in a frenzy about wanting to go to the dining hall.`
`.........Luckily he had been able to call before they stormed off towards the mansion.`
`{n}Krauss was relieved at his good timing during such tragedy...`
`"We have Kyrie‐san and Doctor Nanjo, as well as Shannon and Kanon here.`
` We're locked in a place that's like a dungeon, but don't worry.`
` We'll figure something out."`
`"Dungeon?`
` Where?!`
` We'll come save you...!!"`
`"Unfortunately, we haven't the slightest idea where this is either.`
` We think it might be under the dining hall, but that might not be true.`
` .........But anyway, Jessica.`
` You must not leave there.`
` You've heard from Gohda what happened?"`
`"Yeah......`
` ......Grandfather,`
` .........he...`
`......{nobr:{m:-5:——}—ed} everyone......"`
`"Grandfather isn't in a sane state of mind right now.`
` If you run into him, you'll be in danger.`
` You might be killed...!`
` You mustn't even think about trying to come and save us...!`
` We'll take care of ourselves."`
`"Th‐then what should we do?!`
` Grandfather, you piece of shit, how dare you do that to Mom and the rest......!`
` I'm gonna kill that worthless old bastard...!!"`
`"Jessica, if you talk like that, you'll sadden your mother.`
` A lady doesn't use those kinds of words."`
`"Uuuuughhu......uuuuuhughhu......!!"`
`"Anyway, you all put your own safety first.`
` Lock up the guesthouse.`
` ......But you mustn't get complacent.`
` The large window in the downstairs lounge might get broken."`
`"Stay in the room you're in, and use a bed to make a barricade.`
` There's a toilet and fridge in there too, right?`
` You should be able to stay holed up until tomorrow morning."`
`"......Alright, I'll say it again... Don't think of anything dangerous.`
` And definitely don't think about trying to take revenge for Mom!`
` Think only of hiding and making it through this, and don't provoke the enemy."`
`"Yeah......mm....!!`
` Okay, ......Dad......!`
` Uuuuhhughuuuu!!"`
`After that, Gohda took the phone,`
` and was told again to watch over the children as a responsible adult.`
`......Gohda repeatedly replied "Yes, sir!" in an overstrained voice, his face covered in cold sweat.`
`From there, Kyrie received the phone and spoke with Battler, and when Shannon and Kanon got their turn, George and Jessica answered.`
` And following that, Nanjo and Kumasawa picked up as well, so that all members of both sides had their turn on the phone,`
` each encouraging the other and confirming that they were at least safe for now, even if their location was unknown,`
` and coming to a complete understanding of the current situation for both sides.`
`They wanted to talk forever, but now was not the time to chat.`
`Krauss told them that they would be hanging up for now, and those in the guesthouse agreed.`
`"If anything else happens, we'll call.`
` Wait by the phone so you can pick it up quickly.`
` Again, be careful.`
` You mustn't do anything rash...!"`
`"Y‐......yeah, I understand......`
` Just knowing that you and......Kanon‐kun and the rest are safe, ......that's a win in my book......`
` ...We'll do our best.`
` Please stay safe...!"`
`"Yeah, of course.`
` Well then, I'm hanging up for now.`
` Be on your guard."`
`With that, the phone call ended.`
`Gohda and the rest of the men quickly descended the stairs, closed the shutters, and secured the strong locks on the doors.`
`However, just as Krauss had worried, there was nothing that could be done about the beautiful wide window in the downstairs lounge.`
`If this were to be broken, it would be easy for them to get inside.`
`It wouldn't be hard for someone like Kinzo, who hadn't hesitated at committing murder, to invade the first floor.`
`"......It's likely that Grandfather and his followers will be armed.`
` Locking ourselves in this room is our best bet, and moreover our only method of staying locked down.`
` ......It's painful that we have no choice but to stuff ourselves in a locked room, but if our enemies are carrying guns, then that's the only method we have left to us."`
`"Th‐the Master is said to have a collection of working guns.`
` .........That's right, guns, that was a gun...`
` If so, ......it's a horribly powerful gun...!`
` W‐we can't contend with that at all...!"`
`"............Smashing someone's head, that takes a hell of a lot of force, right?`
` It might be a magnum bullet, or something along those lines.`
` That might go through a flimsy door like it's nothing."`
`"If so, then that's even more of a reason to barricade ourselves in the room...`
` Let's put up a bed and block the window too.`
` ......If we do that much, then it doesn't matter how many guns they've got, they shouldn't be able to break in."`
`"Shit, ......is this passive, one‐sided defense all we can do?`
` ...Goddamn him, knocking off my dad, and even capturing Kyrie‐san...`
` ......You're gonna pay for this, you old goat...!"`
`"I‐i‐i‐impossible, there's no way we can go against them...!!`
` Besides, it's not just the Master, he has several underlings too!`
` Th‐there might even be more of them...!`
` .........Just what......are they......?"`
`Battler was filled to the brim with the urge to get revenge for Rudolf,`
` and to rush out of here to save Kyrie.`
`......But just by looking at how terrified Gohda was, there was no doubt in him that this would be reckless...`
`"......It's gotta be hard on you too, ......right, Aniki?`
` And yet we've gotta stay holed up here, ......goddammit......"`
`"Of course, I'm torn up about it too.`
` ......There's no way I could remain calm with both of my parents murdered."`
`"But specifically because of that, I {i:have} to remain calm!`
` Do you think that our murdered parents would want us to die in vain?`
` There's no way they would!`
` They'd want for at least the children to escape."`
`"That's why I'm going to survive.`
` And I will report this to the police, and uncover everything.`
` The courts will avenge my parents.`
` {i:That} will be my revenge.`
` ......There's no way our parents would want us to die taking revenge for them.`
` Right...?"`
`"...........................`
` ......You're right...`
` You're damn right...`
` ......That old bastard, fuck your stupid ritual...!`
` If you're saying we're gonna be sacrifices for that, then we'll run away just to spite you, and fuck up the whole goddamn thing......"`
`"That's the way.`
` ......Besides, you still have Kyrie‐san, Battler‐kun.`
` And I still have Shannon.`
` Let's just act cautiously and wait for our chance.`
` Carelessness on our part might even work against the others who are captured."`
`"......Hostages, ......huh.`
` .........But Grandfather captured them so he could use them as sacrifices, right?!`
` If we don't go and save them, then they're just waiting to be killed, aren't they?!"`
`"We don't even know where the dungeon they're being held in is...!`
` Neither did Shannon or Kanon‐kun, or of course Gohda‐san or Kumasawa‐san."`
`"The probability that they're in a secret location that only Grandfather knows of is incredibly high.`
` ...Under these circumstances, aimlessly wandering about is suicide!"`
`"......I, ......I know that...`
` .........But still......goddammit......are you saying the only thing we can do is stay confined here until something happens......?"`
`"Ba‐......Battler‐sama, I understand your feelings, but...`
`......let's put safety first...`
` ......From what Krauss‐sama said, they seem to be in a fairly old cell,`
` and they may be able to break the bars somehow.`
` ......The wise choice of action now is to believe in them and wait."`
`"Grandfather has a number of subordinates, and they're all armed, correct...?"`
`"Y‐......yes, that is correct.`
` .........And they're probably...`
`yes, all armed......"`
`Gohda had been able to say that Kinzo had others on his side,`
` ......but he had not been able to mention that they were mostly all young women, like witches, ......and committed their murders using strange magic.`
`If he had said that, it would only have caused the others to doubt his sanity.`
`...No, in fact, he himself still couldn't understand what he had seen, and was doubting his own sanity.`
`......But, regardless of sex or appearance, ......regardless of whether it was done with magic or a gun.`
`The fact that those girls had followed Kinzo's orders,`
` and killed six people in an instant...was an unshakable truth......`
`If those people came to attack the guesthouse as well, ......what would happen?`
`Just closing the doors and windows like this was surely meaningless......`
`Gohda, ......as well as Kumasawa.`
`The only thing left for those two, who had witnessed that massacre in the dining hall,`
` was to cradle their heads, not even knowing how to interpret what they had seen...`
`".........Kumasawa‐san, are you okay......?`
` Want some tea......?"`
`"H‐hohohohoho...`
` Thank you very much, yes, thank you...`
` ...I'm sorry, but may I be left with my thoughts for a little while.........?"`
`Maria tried to be nice, but it seemed that Kumasawa still wasn't able to clear away her confusion.`
`"......Maria, thanks for being considerate.`
` Let's let Kumasawa‐san rest for now."`
`"......Uu."`
`Jessica too showed consideration for Kumasawa, certain of the shock she must have received after witnessing such a tragedy,`
` ......but her imagination couldn't even come close to the impossible scene Kumasawa had witnessed...`
`Nevertheless, with her mother having been killed, and her father having been captured,`
` there was no way that Jessica could stay calm either.`
`She sealed her anxiety and sadness using her anger towards Kinzo, and walked irritatedly around the room.`
`"............Kumasawa‐san.`
` Is Mom really.........dead?"`
`"......Y‐yes......`
` ......I've never seen such a...horrible way to die before......"`
`"It's...not possible that she's still alive,`
` .........and with treatment, we could save her,`
` ......is it......?"`
`"...........................`
` ......A‐.........after such a thing happened to her head, it's unimaginable that she could still be.........alive......"`
`".................................`
` ......Well, yeah...`
` ......If the head gets smashed,`
` ......there's normally no need for treatment, is there......"`
`When Gohda had come flying into the guesthouse, overcome with agitation,`
` he had told about the massacre in the dining hall without concealing anything.`
`......Except for the part about the witches and magic, which they themselves still could not believe.`
`In other words, they hadn't even sugarcoated the cold‐blooded way in which Natsuhi and the others had died.`
`......It was too late now, but Kumasawa regretted having obviously said too much......`
`However, while lightly shaking her head and with a slightly painful laugh, Jessica spoke.`
`"......No, if anything, I was able to stay level‐headed thanks to what you told us."`
`".........If you'd avoided mentioning the part about her head being smashed,`
` ...maybe I'd have said that she could still be alive,`
` then ran off towards the mansion, straight into Grandfather, ......and I might have been killed."`
`"......There's a chance that sliver of hope would've been fatal.`
` .........With that in mind, I'm grateful."`
`"......I am deeply sorry.....`
` I apologize for not choosing my words carefully..."`
`"Don't worry about it now.`
` There's nothing we can do about Mom now......but Dad's still alive.`
` Kanon‐kun and Shannon, and Auntie Kyrie and Doctor Nanjo too."`
`"......I want to save them somehow, so we shouldn't do anything unnecessary that might be a burden to them.`
` ......The most helpful thing we can do right now might be to wait by the phone."`
`There could be a phone call asking them to create a diversion to facilitate their escape.`
`Or perhaps the others might learn their location, and call for rescue.`
`......Jessica understood that in order to act promptly when that time came, the only thing they could do for the time being was to wait in this room...`
`George, Battler, and Gohda returned, having finished checking all of the locks downstairs.`
`Each of the three was holding a bunch of different objects.`
`George had things like drinks, canned food, crackers, and other types of snacks that he had found in the lounge and pantry, as well as a first‐aid kit.`
`All consumables that would be indispensable while they were locked down.`
`Gohda had a large folding ladder and carpentry tools.`
`Those were so that, in the case of an emergency, they could nail over the door from the inside to seal it.`
`{n}If it came to that, the ladder was for escaping out the window.`
`Battler had brought up objects which could be used as weapons, such as blades and poles.`
`The kitchen knives went without saying; the disassembled table legs could be used as clubs;`
` and the pole roughly the size of a person, which had been made by taking apart a hat stand,`
` could surely be used as a spear, even though it had no point.`
`......There was a good possibility that the enemies were carrying guns, so it was dubious whether these would be of any use.`
`But it was still better than not having them, and if those things could provide at least a little peace of mind, then they could also expect some kind of calming effect from them.`
`Then, they placed beds and sofas from around the room up against the door, barricading it.`
`They didn't go so far as to seal it up with nails.`
` ......There was still the chance that Krauss and the others would escape, and come to meet up.`
`They had apparently set up a barricade at the top of the stairs as well.`
`{n}It had been designed to create a racket, so it would work in place of a warning alarm as well.`
`It was apparently Battler's idea.`
`For that reason, they turned the TV off.`
`{n}.........So that if the first‐floor window were to be broken, they would know by the sound.`
`Once the switch had been turned off, all that was left was an eerie silence.`
`......The sound of the violent wind and rain.`
` Were they going to have to spend the whole night in such crushing suspense?`
`The boat was meant to be coming tomorrow morning.`
`However, judging by the weather report, the typhoon was expected to continue all day tomorrow, and the boat probably wouldn't come.`
`......The typhoon would pass in the morning of the day after tomorrow.`
`In other words, the boat would be coming the morning of the day after tomorrow, ......as in, the morning of October 6th.`
`And right now, it was late at night, October 4th.`
`.........They would have to spend more than thirty hours on this island,`
` with Kinzo turned cold‐blooded murderer and his weird companions prowling about......`
`Even with the shutters closed, there would definitely be a little bit of light seeping out.`
`It might let the enemy know that they were hiding here.`
`......Battler suggested that it might be best to turn off the lights.`
`But they had already been taken over by such a ghastly feeling just from turning the TV off.`
`.......There wasn't anyone who directly challenged his proposal, but then again, there wasn't a single other person who agreed to it.........`
`"......Uu.`
` Can't watch TV?"`
`"Yeah, sorry, but you'll have to bear with it.`
` ......We can't afford to miss the sound of the enemy breaking in."`
`"........................`
` ......Boring."`
`Even though she had been told that her mother had died, Maria alone somehow didn't seem to feel an approaching sense of danger.`
`It seemed she was quite displeased with having the TV turned off.`
`.........Even with this bizarre situation in front of her, she can't share our sense of danger?`
`......Because she's so young?`
`To Battler right now, seeing that young girl act in a way that was even slightly out of place...`
`made him feel that there was something very eerie about Maria......`
`"All that said.`
` .........There's nothing more to try.`
` Do you think you'll be able to do anything about the bars?"`
`"......Unfortunately, they're tougher than I imagined.`
` I don't know when these were made, but their durability is certainly up to snuff.`
` These are truly made rather well."`
`Kyrie chuckled softly.`
`{n}......They had no moves they could make, but the mood had calmed just a little.`
`"......This place is just like where you place chess pieces once you've captured them.`
` ......There is nothing left we can do, then......?"`
`"Not so fast.`
` It's still too early to give in.`
` If we stop thinking, we might as well stop breathing, right?"`
`"Exactly.`
` ......Chess pieces taken aside may have no purpose, but there's a great purpose for them in shogi.`
` Just one captured pawn should be able to put pressure on the opponent."`
`"I see...`
` But still, there's nothing that can be done about these bars......"`
`"For us, maybe.`
` .........But, if we can pinpoint where this is and contact Gohda‐san, we might be able to get him to come and save us."`
`"I see...`
` But that would mean forcing danger on Gohda‐san......`
` And I would also be worried for the children in the guesthouse, without a full‐grown adult male..."`
`"If you're risk‐averse, biding your time until the situation improves again is not a bad idea.`
` ......However, if you don't know when to cut your losses, what you have might become worthless scraps of paper.`
` ......And what we have is our lives."`
`"Our dignity as parents, too, right?`
` After talking big like that during the telephone call, and telling them that we'd handle it and they should stay put, we can't just start asking for help right away.`
` That would be very uncool.`
` *giggle*."`
`"At this point, pride is already worth less than nothing.`
` .........Why don't we put our heads together?`
` Where is this?`
` Is it really underneath the dining hall?`
` Or else, is it a different place, separate from the mansion...?"`
`Krauss, Kyrie, and Nanjo began to discuss their plans.`
`Kanon was squatting by the bars, silently trying to sense anyone's presence.`
` ......Just as he had been ordered.`
`Shannon came close to him, and they both squatted down together.`
`"............Do you sense someone?"`
`".........Yes.`
` ......They aren't paying any attention in this direction, but there's somebody relatively close by."`
`"Is it {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}...?"`
`"............I think it's the goats.`
` Their breathing is really noisy."`
`Kanon's ability to sense the presence of others was several levels above that of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
`He described their breathing as noisy, but Krauss and the rest couldn't even pick up the slightest hint of it.`
`......Therefore, even if he had simply reported it, they would merely have doubted his ears.`
`"...............They got us, didn't they."`
`".....................`
` ......It's unusual.`
` For us to be captured without being killed."`
`"This time, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama didn't make her appearance.`
` And the Master left his study.`
` ......I don't have a clue what's going on..."`
`"I do.`
` .........Whatever happens or changes, it's all for that witch's fickle entertainment.`
` The result will be no different."`
`"I wonder if this time we'll be able to.........go to the Golden Land."`
`"Who knows.`
` We have a high rate of losing."`
`"............Come to think of it, it's a rare thing that both of us survived the first twilight, isn't it?`
` ......I get the feeling that it's incredibly unusual for us to be able to talk together like this even though the ritual has already begun."`
`"Maybe.`
` ......But that's still just for the witch's entertainment.`
` I'm not thinking of it as anything other than her letting us live just a little longer to ridicule us, since we usually drop out right in the beginning."`
`"I wonder if........we'll be unable to reach the Golden Land again."`
`"I'm sure we won't.`
` ......If we hold onto any foolish hope, we'll get taken advantage of again."`
`"*giggle*.`
` That's right.`
` Last time you got taken advantage of."`
`"......I'm an idiot."`
`Kanon made a sour look, and turned his head.`
`Shannon laughed softly, and apologetically leaned towards his shoulder.`
`"But......it's nice to hear that Milady is safe, isn't it?"`
`"......She's escaped the first twilight, that's all.`
` ......She might just be being made to wait for an even crueler death in a later twilight."`
`"What about you, Nee‐san?`
` ......Aren't you glad George‐sama's safe?`
` It'd be nice if you two could reach the Golden Land together."`
`".........Thanks.`
` I wish the same for you and Milady as well."`
`"I, I don't have my hopes up.`
` .........It's just as you say.`
` All that witch is doing is having fun dangling prizes in front of people, and watching them flounder."`
`".........I'm sure no one will be able to go to the Golden Land.`
` ......If I was foolish enough to wish to reach the Golden Land with Milady,`
` .........that witch would find that very fun to toy with, and would certainly never let us reach there."`
`"......You're right.`
` .........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is thinking about which order of sacrifices will be the most interesting."`
`"The whole thing about them being chosen at random is just a blatant lie.`
` That swindling witch...`
` ......All that about having any wish you want granted in the Golden Land is probably just a lie."`
`"..................That's not true.`
` The Golden Land is......a wonderful place."`
`"Have you been there?"`
`".........Only for a little bit.`
` Though, even that was probably just {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's joke."`
`"...............What's it like there?"`
`"Well.`
` .........It's a wonderful place.`
` ...I can't really explain it well.`
` It's a world like a pleasant dream."`
`"A paradise‐like place, with roses blooming all over and beautiful butterflies dancing, or something like that?"`
`"......It's not a place with a tangible image like that.`
` It really is like being in a dream.`
` When you're there, it's very gentle, very peaceful,`
` ......and you're allowed to sleep as long as you want, like when you wake up early on your day off, lying under the covers."`
`"......Sunlight comes in through the cracks in the curtains, and you think "I have to get up",`
` but then you realize it's your day off, and you can go back under the covers again...it's a place where you can feel like that."`
`"I'd feel annoyed that I got up at all.`
` Getting up by accident even though it's your day off is something only you would do, Nee‐san.`
` .........Go on?"`
`"Well.`
` While I was there, I felt very contented, and very calm.`
` But once you return to this world, you can't remember it well, even though you've only just been there."`
`"It's a lot like when you can't remember a dream you were just having.`
` ......But I still remember that it was a very calm and quiet world."`
`".........That's it?`
` Wow, that Golden Land she's always bragging about isn't much special at all.`
` ......I thought it was a place where all your wishes come true."`
`"It is.`
` It's a place where all your wishes will be granted.`
` .........Well, maybe that's not quite it.`
` It might be better to say it's a place where you don't have to wish for anything."`
`"......For example, if you were cold, Kanon‐kun, and wished you had a jacket, you'd be happy to be given one,`
` but if you were in a warm room to begin with, there wouldn't even be a reason to want a jacket, right?"`
`"......That's what the Golden Land is like.`
` There's no need to even wish for most wishes.`
` It's a world released from everything, where everything is calm."`
`"You could even say it's a place that transcends the concept that having your wishes granted will bring happiness...a world released from everything."`
`"........................`
` ......It sounds kind of religious."`
`"And there, everything is equal.`
` All things with minds are equal.`
` ......There are no {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, nor furniture, nor witches.`
` ......There, I was equal to everyone.`
` There was no longer any need to feel ashamed of myself because I was furniture."`
`".........It was honestly a happy world where I was equal to all {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, and even witches.`
` I can't really remember it well,`
` but I have the feeling that when I was there, I was equal even to {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, and we were good friends."`
`"............If that witch is there, then it's not a much of a paradise."`
`".........So, you want to go to that blissful Golden Land with George‐sama.`
` That's strange.`
` The Golden Land is a utopia where you want for nothing, right?`
` Wouldn't you be content even if George‐sama wasn't there?"`
`".....................`
` ...The Golden Land is very calm, peaceful, and everything is fair and equal.`
` ......But actually, happiness alone is left out."`
`"It isn't a happy world?"`
`"Of course, just by being peaceful, calm, and fair, it's an incredibly happy world.`
` ......But I guess you could say that it's a world of zero, where you're released from all negative worries."`
`"The human world is filled with negatives, so of course a zero world is incredibly happy, ......but it's still zero.`
` *giggle*, that's asking for a lot, isn't it?"`
`"......It's something like this.`
` When you're nodding off on your quiet holiday morning,`
` ......if the person you love the most is next to you, and they're holding your hand, then it can become an even greater, more wonderful happiness, .........something like that.`
` ...Sorry, Nee‐san is horrible with analogies, I'm too stupid."`
`"......So,`
` to you, the greatest happiness would be reaching that world together with George‐sama."`
`"Yes.`
` And I'm sure that for you, it would be reaching that world together with Milady."`
`"The two will be released from their worries in a fair world...?`
` .........It feels like I'm being indoctrinated into some kind of strange religion.`
` I imagined something more...worldly.`
` A world where we would be given magic medicine, and that would make us be born again as {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, or something more like that."`
`".........If you go, you'll understand.`
` If {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama really is a fickle person, then surely some day, she'll let you get a glimpse of it too.`
` ......Then you'll be able to understand my example."`
`"....................................`
` Well, I'm not holding my breath.`
` ......At any rate, it seems like game over for us this time already.`
` Maybe we can do better some other time."`
`"......You're right.`
` If we have some strange hope, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama will take advantage of us again.`
` .........It might be best for us just to stop thinking, and entrust ourselves to fate."`
`".........We just need to be simple chess pieces.`
` ......No matter what we think or don't think, we can't escape from the witch's chessboard.`
` Our role is now just to wait and see how we'll be tortured to death.`
` ......For us, the dream of the Golden Land is too unavailing."`
`"..................You're...right.`
` ......Sorry......"`
`Kanon shrugged his shoulders, then told Shannon to leave him alone because she was interfering with his duty, distancing himself from her.`
`Realizing her thoughtlessness in bringing up such an inappropriate topic and instead hurting Kanon,`
` Shannon bit her lower lip and stared at the ground...`
`She wouldn't bother him any more.`
`{n}She went off and squatted in a corner by herself.`
`".....................nn—"`
`At that moment, Kanon twitched.`
`{n}It was like the ears of a cat when it reacts to a faint sound.`
`"What's wrong?"`
`"......Shh.`
` .........Krauss‐sama, somebody is coming."`
`"What?!"`
`They ended their conversation and strained their ears.`
`......For a while, they couldn't hear anything,`
` but before long, they were able to hear the sounds of a large group of people walking...`
`"......So they've come."`
`"The time of reckoning is upon us—or else, our first and final chance."`
`".........I shall talk to Kinzo‐san.`
` ...I will try to find out where this place is somehow."`
`"We're counting on you.`
` ..........................."`
`During the last phone call, Kyrie had asked what the time over at the guesthouse was.`
`......It had been the same as her watch, and by this she had learned that their watches hadn't been set back.`
`It wasn't just the clocks on the walls in the guesthouse.`
`{n}Several people's watches, including George's and Gohda's, had matched.`
`......If that was the case,`
` then after the massacre in the dining hall, they had been transported to the dungeon in only a few minutes.`
`Not enough time had passed for them to be knocked out and carried away.`
`Then were those really pitfalls, meaning that this was the area directly under the dining hall......?`
`All they could do was pray that Nanjo could find out where this was...`
`"......They're coming.`
` There's probably...four people.`
` ......The Master, and three of those who appeared in the dining hall."`
`"OK, good.`
` You come back here as well now.`
` We'll deal with the rest."`
`"Shannon‐chan, sorry, but can I have you sit by the phone?`
` Hide it with your skirt."`
`"Ah......yes...!"`
`The presence came closer, ......and there was the sound of a heavy door being opened at the other end of the corridor.`
`The light they were apparently carrying illuminated the dimly lit corridor, stroking the walls with razor‐sharp shadows.`
`And then, the light from the lantern they held lit up the prisoners through the bars.`
`......The bars' sharp shadows divided them up lengthwise.`
`There were four figures there.`
` .........It was Kinzo, ............Ronove, {f:5:Virgilia}, and Gaap.`
`"The head of the Ushiromiya family, Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}.`
` Everyone, your silence, please."`
`"...............{f:5:Goldsmith}?"`
`"It's Father's pen name.`
` It seems he always signs with it when writing those bizarre grimoires."`
`"‘Kinzo’ made English‐style?`
` Shouldn't that be {f:5:Goldwarehouse}?"`
`".........Hahhahahahahahahahahaha.`
` A warehouse is a place to keep things in and nothing more.`
` Whereas I create gold, and use my craftsmanship to further increase its worth.`
` Don't you think "smith" is much more fitting?"`
`"...............Certainly.`
` I apologize for blathering."`
`"Kinzo‐san......`
` ......Just what is going on?`
` Where in the world is this...?"`
`"Oh, my friend.`
` Can't you remember?`
` Certainly, you may never have entered the prison, but you should remember walking through this corridor."`
`".........Huh,`
` ............huh?`
` ...............Y‐you don't mean........."`
`"......Do you have an idea?"`
`"But, no, .........that is inconceivable.`
` ......Firstly, we fell through a pitfall, and furthermore, we were locked up in here after only a few minutes...`
` ......Not only is the distance too great, that's physically impossible......"`
`"For a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, right?`
` *giggle*."`
`"Father... Is this the mansion?`
` To think that the mansion had an underground area like this......"`
`"Kraussss.`
` Wasn't there a place whose existence you all whispered of, and which you followed after me on numerous occasions trying to find?`
` .........This is that place.`
` No, to be correct, this is under that place.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"This place couldn't be............Kuwadorian's...`
`...basement...?!"`
`"......It is as you surmise.`
` This is the basement of Kuwadorian."`
`"Kuwadorian......`
` ......You don't mean...Father's rumored hidden mansion......?`
` It really exists......?"`
`"This mansion was constructed for the sole use of my beloved witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` It is truly a shame that I cannot show you around the above‐ground section, as it is such a beautiful and elegant mansion."`
`".........How lovely, just the two of you alone in a mansion with this kind of room.`
` It seems that you and I are differently inclined."`
`"......Kyrie‐san.`
` ......It would be wise to refrain from such rude comments."`
`"*giggle*.`
` But I agree.`
` ......If a mansion I was given had this kind of dungeon in it,`
` even a hundred‐year love would turn cold, and I'd take anything of value and run for the hills."`
`"Pu ku ku.`
` Oh? You have no interest in this sort of thing?`
` And here I was thinking that you would go head over heels."`
`"Heheh.`
` .........Of course I go head over heels.`
` If I get a collar or something for a birthday present.`
` ......But only if he's a stud."`
`"Puu ku ku ku ku!"`
`"Quiet!`
` ......Don't you need a gag more than a collar?"`
`"Oh, even that's not off‐limits for you?`
` You sure aren't picky, Lia.`
` *giggle*......"`
`"Wh‐who gave you permission to shorten my name...?!"`
`"Enough, you noisy women!`
` Are you telling me you'd like to be locked up in the same cell?"`
`"I, I apologize, my lord...`
` This old body of mine would not be able to stand such a cold prison..."`
`{f:5:Virgilia} quickly apologized, but Gaap merely laughed together with Ronove.`
`It was like she was saying that she wouldn't be captured,`
` or else, that even if she were to be captured, it would be meaningless......`
`"A prison is a place where the captured cannot escape from.`
` That implies the strong will and love to not let go for a lifetime.`
` A woman who you could give up on if she ran away is not worth the word "love"."`
`"A woman who makes you fall so madly in love that you don't want to let her escape, to the point of binding her in chains...`
` It is only upon reaching that level that it becomes a love worth sacrificing my life for.`
` .........I will not ask you to understand."`
`".........I cannot be bound by anyone, and will not be bound.`
` I don't want to be loved, I want to love.`
` I feel the same as you, {f:5:Goldsmith}.`
` That's why I understand the madness of your love."`
`"Love and madness are two sides of the same coin, or so they say.`
` How bothersome."`
`".........But learning where we are so easily was a big step.`
` We'll ask the details later, but it seems that you know about this place, right, Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"Y‐yes......`
` ......If that corridor is the underground passage beneath Kuwadorian,`
` .........then if we go straight there, it will become a long tunnel,`
` ......and if we stay on that, we should be able to return to the mansion."`
`"......Then if we could just do something about these bars, we could go home."`
`"Father...`
` What are you planning to do with us?"`
`"As I have already declared, you are the sacrifices for the later twilights.`
` There are conveniently five of you here.`
` You will be perfect as hostages for the five gougings."`
`"......I see.`
` ...Then it's the time of reckoning for us, then?"`
`"Eventually.`
` That's not why I'm here this time, so relax.`
` Besides, I believe I said it already.`
` ......If one of my grandchildren is deemed suitable to inherit everything from me, then the ritual will be called off.`
` In other words, your lives will be spared."`
`"......Wh‐what are you planning to do to the children?"`
`"To see if they are suitable to be my successor or not,`
` I shall give them a test.`
` If even one of them can impress me, I'll call the ritual off."`
`".........And if there isn't anyone suitable,`
` ......what are you planning on doing with the children?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` There's no need to worry about that.`
` After all, you are the ones who will be made into sacrifices first.`
` Anything after that should be of no concern to you."`
`"You simply need to place your fates in the hands of your own children.`
` ......Your children, the fruit of what you've birthed, taught and raised.`
` They should truly be the most suitable to entrust with your fate...!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Don't make such a worried face, Kraaauss...`
` Believe in the daughter that you brag is worth ten billion yen.`
` Hehheheh, heh{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!"`
`".........Exactly.`
` Children are the fruit of their parents.`
` Worthy of entrusting with the parent's fate.`
` And Father, that applies even to you."`
`"......Heheh, hahhahahaha!`
` This woman has guts, what a waste on Rudolf!`
` Wahhaha{0}hahaha...!!"`
`"...Kyrie‐san, ......it would be best not to aggravate him too much."`
`"I agree.`
` Let's bear with it for now......"`
`"That's right...`
` ......After all, we're simply fish on a chopping board.`
` There's nothing we can do now."`
`"Except insult me with such vigor.`
` I don't dislike that kind of woman, you know?`
` {f:5:Beatrice} was that kind of woman too, in the beginning.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"............My lord.`
` Let us get to the main topic.`
` We've been getting derailed for a while now."`
`"Ah yes, there was that. Sorry, sorry, my friend.`
` Well then, let's get to the main topic.`
` For that, I've prepared a phone.`
` .......Shannon, very shrewd of you.`
` You don't have to hide it any longer.`
` I had that put there.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"M‐my apologies......"`
`"........................"`
`Shannon quickly withdrew, and the telephone was revealed...`
`"Krauss.`
` Call the grandchildren in the guesthouse.`
` And tell them of the test—of the start of my trial."`
`With a gesture that seemed to be saying "go ahead", Ronove urged Krauss to pick up the receiver.`
`"...............And if I say no?"`
`"Hohoh, and why do you think you're in a position where you can make a deal?`
` If you don't call, then the grandchildren won't even be given a chance.`
` The Ushiromiya family will end here.`
` And I'll turn you all into sacrifices right away!!"`
`"You'd be lucky to become sacrifices right away.`
` ......Don't you think it'd be more painful to watch the children be made into sacrifices first, before your very eyes...?"`
`"......Ga...ap.`
` The Master is the one who decides the order of the sacrifices.`
` Keep your opinions to yourself."`
`"Lia, you just tried to shorten my name and failed, didn't you?"`
`"I, I did not!`
` And I told you not to shorten my name...!"`
`"......Women truly are..."`
`"Noisy. Pu ku ku!"`
`The clinic that Nanjo had opened and later passed on to his son still existed on Niijima.`
`The aged doctor was Nanjo's son, but the atmosphere about him was very different.`
`"I am truly sorry to say this after you have come all this way, but I have nothing in particular to tell you."`
`Nanjo's son spoke very indifferently.`
`"......After the accident on that island was taken up by the talk shows in a most indiscreet manner,`
` there was a great deal of deeply offensive probing into my father, who was {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya's} doctor and friend."`
`"All of it was without proof, and also, defiled all of my father's previous achievements.`
` I still feel a great deal of resentment towards all of that."`
`"............I think that's understandable.`
` It's been pretty much the same for me.`
` Constantly since I was six."`
`"True.`
` My apologies."`
`The doctor finally remembered that Ange was also a victim, exposed to the same curious eyes as he had been.`
`"In that case, you can probably understand why I want nothing more to do with that incident.`
` ......That was an unfortunate accident.`
` The only ones who want to make a fuss about it being a crime are the irresponsible TV shows and magazines.`
` I am more than fed up with their attitude."`
`.........Nanjo had been placed in the spotlight for being one of Ushiromiya Kinzo's few friends.`
`Because of that, there had probably been a persistent offensive from the Witch Hunters and the press to use the late Nanjo's son as well as a source of information.`
`......The doctor went on and on, criticizing the press indignantly.`
`"I really understand how you feel.`
` My personal life was put under surveillance,`
` and I had no privacy, no portrait rights, heck, I don't know if I was even afforded human rights.`
` So I {i:deeply} empathize with your pent‐up anger."`
`".........And for that very reason, I want to know, more than anything else, what in the world was that incident that so thoroughly ruined my life.`
` That's why I came here."`
`".........I'm a related party just like you.`
` Not a magazine columnist or an interviewer.`
` Please, don't get the wrong idea."`
`"I didn't come to do this for fun.`
` ......And I'd very much appreciate it if you stopped looking down on me.`
` If we're going to do a comparison of whose life was most screwed up by that incident, you won't even come close."`
`"............mgh......"`
`Ange spoke sharply.`
`Never having imagined that he would be talked back to in such a forceful manner, the doctor couldn't help but fall silent.`
`......From Ange's perspective, the doctor was whining about absolutely nothing.`
`She really wanted him to pack in his patronizing attitude.`
` It was about time to make him understand how many days had passed for her before arriving on this island.`
`The doctor realized that he had misspoken, and remained silent for a while, looking uncomfortable.`
`"I know it's probably painful to remember what happened at the time, but if there's anything you do know, please tell me, no matter what it is.`
` Of course, I'll tell no one."`
`"I visited here today to bring some closure to my life.`
` ......I'm eighteen.`
` That incident took away twelve years of my life.`
` And it'll probably keep on taking."`
`"......I was thrown into darkness when I was six years old and I've never gotten out.`
` Are you still going to tell me I have no right to know...?"`
`".........No, ...I'm sorry.`
` It seems that since all the others who came were ill‐natured folk, I instinctively put up my guard.`
` I apologize for my rudeness."`
`"......Alright.`
` If you'll swear not to breathe a word of this to anyone, I'll tell you everything."`
`"Thank you, Doctor.`
` ......Then, if you would.`
` Please tell me anything you can."`
`"......As you know, my father was not only {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya's} personal physician, but his friend through the game of chess.`
` That relationship was very long, stretching back to the time {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya} moved to Rokkenjima."`
`"Just how close were they?"`
`"Considerably, it seems.`
` It seems that their connection through chess led my father to stay at {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya's} mansion quite often."`
`"......I am not sure it is right of me to say this, but {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya} was extremely moody.`
` And my father was an exceedingly magnanimous man, who excelled at interacting with people like him.`
` It's not hard to imagine that he was a rare friend for the isolated {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya}."`
`"That day was the day of the family conference.`
` ......The Ushiromiya family conferences are said to have involved harsh questioning from Ushiromiya Kinzo over how his fortune would be put to use,`
` almost like a financial conference.`
` So Doctor Nanjo had gained a trust so great that he was asked to attend even that...?"`
`"My father was a simple doctor,`
` so I cannot imagine that he was in a position to advise on asset management for a millionaire family like the Ushiromiyas."`
`"He was most likely called there to assist, because {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya's} health was not at its best at the time.`
` ......As {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya's} close friend, I'm sure that my father would have kept his mouth shut, and been trusted not to leak the secrets of the family conference."`
`"......Was Ushiromiya Kinzo in very bad health at the time?`
` Are there any medical charts left?"`
`"My father probably took the medical charts with him on the day of the accident.`
` I'm afraid to say that the entire folder of {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya's} medical charts has been lost.`
` He was my father's patient, so I don't know the details either."`
`"Around the time of the incident.`
` Was there anything you thought was strange?"`
`".....................`
` ......Well, there was...`
` ......However, it seems exceedingly likely to result in a misunderstanding, so I don't particularly want to talk about it."`
`"......What is it?`
` Please tell me."`
`For a while, the doctor beat around the bush,`
` but after he'd said that much, Ange would not allow the subject to be dodged.`
`Eventually, he was worn down, and after making Ange swear herself to secrecy again, he opened up......`
`"The truth is, several days after that accident, I received something by mail at my home."`
`".........Mail?"`
`"It was very curious.`
` The sender was made out to be me, but I had no memory of it.`
` Someone had sent it in my name."`
`"The destination was Rebun Island in Hokkaido.`
` ......It's at the northernmost tip of Japan, excluding the Northern Territories.`
` The recipient's address was on Rebun Island, but.........`
`the name was my father's."`
`"......However, it seems there was a problem with the destination address, so it had received an "Address Unknown" label,`
` and been returned to the sender, "me"."`
`It was...truly a strange tale.`
`Nanjo's son's name was written as the sender.`
`{n}......However, he said that he hadn't mailed the letter.`
`In short, that meant someone had sent it using his name.`
`The destination was "Nanjo Terumasa", on Hokkaido's Rebun Island.`
`But the lot number written on it didn't exist,`
` so the local post office had been unable to deliver it, and instead sent it back to "the sender, Nanjo's son"......`
`"......What was inside?"`
`"...........................`
` ......I truly ask that you keep silent about this.`
` I am by no means pleased to have received this.`
` Even so, I can hardly throw it away......"`
`The doctor stood up and headed for the bookshelf.`
`There, dozens of dictionaries that could only have been ornamental were lined up one after another,`
` asserting in the strongest way imaginable that the owner was an intellectual.`
`When he pulled several volumes out from there, a large, brown envelope was hidden behind them.`
`He took it out and tossed it onto the desk.`
`It had been been carefully sealed with adhesive tape,`
` and its faded color and dryness told that it had remained sealed for twelve whole years......`
`"Most sincerely, .........I ask for your silence."`
`While emphasizing it so much it was annoying, the doctor removed the seal with a quality paper knife.`
`......Then, when he tilted the envelope, an already opened mail envelope spilled out.`
`The envelope had weight to it, hinting that there was something other than a letter inside.`
`.........The recipient...was certainly Nanjo Terumasa.`
`{n}Even seeing that......was a huge shock.`
`After that incident, Nanjo's corpse had not been found, and he was being treated as dead in absentia under extraordinary circumstances.`
`......And despite that, this letter addressed to a Nanjo in Hokkaido existed.`
`{n}One could almost take this as a sign that he had faked his own death and escaped to Hokkaido.`
`"......Was Doctor Nanjo really in Hokkaido?`
` Or was there another person there with the same first and last names?"`
`"If my father had somehow escaped from the accident and was living on in Hokkaido,`
` that would have made our family very happy, regardless of the situation."`
`"I also thought of that possibility at first.`
` ......However, the destination address of this envelope does not exist.`
` In short, this envelope was mail that had no way of reaching him."`
`"............Is there a possibility that the sender miswrote the correct address?"`
`"Of course, I cannot disprove that.`
` However, judging from the residence's house number, I find that hard to believe."`
`".........`
`Hokkaido,`
` Rebun Island,`
` Rebun County,`
` Rebun City,`
` 1‐2‐34‐567.`
` ....................."`
`Up until Rebun City, it's alright.`
`...But I just couldn't wipe away the feeling that following sequential number, 1234567, was a little insincere.`
`It felt like a fake address that some kid had made up.`
`"They probably just randomly wrote some clearly nonexistent address.`
` I think it's natural to assume that, from the very beginning, this envelope was sent to a nonexistent address to which {i:it had no chance of being delivered}."`
`If the destination address doesn't exist, mail is generally returned to the sender.`
`But even in the case of a faulty address, the local post office will often courteously,`
` and to the best of its ability, research to find whether the sender's intended destination exists.`
`When they still can't find it, the mail is sometimes returned after an investigation of several days.`
`It seemed that this was what had happened with this envelope, and the stamp was postmarked October 3rd.`
`It was postmarked on Niijima.`
`{n}Niijima is a long way away from Rebun Island.`
`On top of that, the destination was also nonsensical.`
`{n}......It had taken more than a week for the mail to be returned.`
`......In other words, there was an extremely high chance that having this envelope returned to the sender after an indeterminate amount of time...`
`had been the goal from the very beginning.`
`Why do something like that.........?`
`Even before asking what it was that had been sent, this envelope was already veiled in mystery......`
`"..................And inside it?"`
`"Go ahead."`
`After getting the doctor's permission, I tilted the already opened envelope.`
`From the inside came a small, folded letter, and a small key with a number tag attached.`
` A swipe card slid out in addition.`
`A112 was engraved on the key's number tag.`
`{n}......I didn't know what it meant.`
`The swipe card was pitch black and had gold letters engraved on it.`
`"MEMBERS" was written there in English.`
` The jet‐black, gold‐lettered card design made it feel like something very high‐class.`
`......But of course, I didn't have a clue what kind of card it was just from that.`
`......I unfolded the letter.`
`{n}Its contents were extremely brief, and only the following was written:`
`07151129.`
`And the name of a certain massive bank known throughout Japan, as well as the words "Central Branch".`
`......That was all.`
`"What's this.........?"`
`"...............`
` .........It's a card, a key, and a PIN for a safe‐deposit box.`
` And it wasn't a normal safe‐deposit box either.`
` It was an unsettling one, which was apparently reserved only for special clients."`
`After he had finished putting his affairs in order following his father's funeral, he visited the bank.`
`......PIN and key and card.`
` There was no doubt that something of great importance was stored there,`
` and it was natural that he was curious about what that could be.`
`At first, he didn't know what to do.`
`{n}......The card wasn't properly his possession.`
`When he mustered up his courage and showed the card to a bank clerk, he was then switched to a clerk of clearly high status, and was guided to a large vault on the fourth basement floor.`
`The security on the way there was strict.`
`The doctor had himself stored valuable items such as real estate transcripts in safe‐deposit boxes before,`
` but this was something on a whole different level......`
`"......Unlike the procedure at the deposit box I use,`
` their system didn't carry out any identity checks so long as you had a card, a PIN, and a key."`
`"......But, in any case, it was a very secure vault, and I was frightened by how imposing it was.`
` ......I wondered what kind of shady objects might await me that had to be stored in a place like this."`
`"............And so?"`
`"When I passed the card through the reader, I was asked to input the PIN.`
` And after that eight digit number was input and authenticated, I was permitted access to the vault."`
`"......It was an incredible scene.`
` A world like something from a sci‐fi movie.`
` That massive, dimly lit silver room was covered with doors to safes."`
`He entered that room along with the clerk.`
`As soon as the card was read, the vaults he had a right to were apparently determined,`
` so that safes he could open were lit with a green light, while those he couldn't open were lit with a red one.`
`"A112 indicated one of those safes.`
` ......By the way, there was a long line of other safes marked with a green lamp besides that one.`
` I think there were at least twenty."`
`"There might even have been more in other corners of the room.`
` ......In any event, I only had the key to A112.`
` I had no way of checking the contents of the other safes."`
`As the clerk watched, the doctor unlocked and opened the safe.`
`When he did, a safe drawer like a large cabinet opened,`
` ......and an expensive‐looking duralumin case showed itself...`
`That was carried into a separate room, where for the first time, the clerk left, and he was introduced to the contents......`
`"And the contents were.........?"`
`"........................`
` ............Cash."`
`"Cash?`
` How much?"`
`"I have heard that a pack of one million yen in fresh banknotes is precisely one centimeter thick.`
` Since those were.........packed tightly into a duralumin case of such a size..."`
`"......There was probably a hundred million total.`
` I don't know, because I didn't count.`
` I didn't even touch it with my hands.`
` I realized at once.`
` This was dangerous money."`
`It isn't normal to store a whole hundred million yen in cash in a safe like that, case and all.`
`......It's much easier to deal with if you deposit it into a bank account and turn it into a number.`
`The very fact that they were unable to do that made it clear that there was something wrong with that cash......`
`"......My mind went blank, and I instantly realized that I must not get involved."`
`"And you didn't use it at all?"`
`"Yes.`
` I locked it straight back up, returned it to the original safe, and left.`
` ......I have thought about throwing away that key and card, but I have no idea what might happen.`
` For that reason, I've been hiding it in the back of the bookcase, a secret from everyone, for a full twelve years.`
` .........I still don't know what kind of money that was."`
`"......Could I borrow this envelope?"`
`"No.`
` Please just view it here."`
`".....................`
` ......Alright.`
` Then if I may.`
` There's something I want to investigate."`
`I took Onee‐chan's grimoire from the knapsack I had set down.`
`......Then I opened to the page with the paragraph {f:5:Beatrice} had written to Onee‐chan, and compared the handwriting on both......`
`"..................................................."`
`............The characteristic handwriting was unmistakable.`
` The one who had sent this hundred million yen in cash............was {f:5:Beatrice} herself......`
`But, .........what is it...`
` Something's bugging me......`
`{n}What is it.........`
` What is it.........`
`".........Y‐......yeah.`
` I'm pretty sure I got something like that in the mail.`
` Hey Ma, where'd I put that again?!"`
`The same envelope and contents had been sent to Kumasawa's son, who had once lived with her.`
`But he had been very busy in the days since, and seemed to have forgotten about it among the hustle and bustle of everyday life.`
`But apparently, its strange contents had stayed in his memory, and he remembered as soon as Ange told him......`
`After a bit of a wait,`
` his thin‐lipped wife came with the envelope, complaining that he always forgets where he puts things......`
`The modus operandi for the sender and recipient was exactly the same as for Nanjo's son.`
`{n}The sender was made out to be Kumasawa's son, and the recipient was Kumasawa Chiyo.`
`And the destination address was in the Okinawa Prefecture.`
`{n}Okinawa Prefecture, Yaeyama County, Yonaguni City, {nobr:1‐2‐341‐5167}.`
`Yonaguni Island is at the westernmost tip of Japan.`
`{n}And the lot number was exactly like before: a sequential number that had apparently been chosen at random.`
`......Now it was certain.`
` This envelope was definitely sent with the goal of having it be returned to the sender.`
`Its contents were exactly the same.`
`A letter with the PIN and the bank's central branch written on it.`
`{n}A swipe card.`
` A key with attached number tag.`
`The inscription on the number tag was A113.`
`{n}......The number right after the one on the key that had been sent to Nanjo's son.`
`Most likely, inside the vault was the same kind of duralumin case, packed with a hundred million yen in cash......`
`"......Got the feeling my mom had sent it to me from beyond the grave.`
` Don't really get what's inside, and it's creepy, so I just left it alone all this time, and totally forgot about it until today."`
`"......So, you know what this is, girl?`
` Could it be that the same thing came to your place...?"`
`".......................................ah."`
`"......What is it, Ange‐sama?"`
`‘Uryu...headache? Headache...?!’`
`"............Sorry, my head hurts......`
` ......Stabbing pain... .........I {i:know} this......"`
`‘What do you mean, you know this......?’`
`"You don't mean,`
` ......this envelope......came to your place too, Ange‐sama...?"`
`.........I remember......`
` ......I remember......!!`
`A strange envelope was also sent to me...twelve years ago...!!`
`I had fallen into depression after losing my entire family.`
` ...But it was a really strange thing to come in the mail, so a faint memory of it remained.`
`It was a strange letter, which I had no memory of sending, but which had me as the sender.`
`I forget the destination address, but the person it had been sent to was Ushiromiya Rudolf.`
`{n}My father.`
`I remember that I got this letter I thought was from my father who had died, I opened it up,`
` and I found a key and a card that I didn't really understand... I remember being really confused.`
`I felt let down, and threw it away somewhere, I think...`
`Where did I put that envelope?`
`{n}I probably lost it somewhere in the chaos that followed.`
`By now, I have no way of checking its contents.`
`But somehow I think I can guess.`
`......I'm sure the contents were the same.`
` Without a doubt, there must have been a key, a card, and a note with a PIN inside the envelope......`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}......`
` ......What was she trying to do here...?`
` So did she hand out this stupid money to all surviving relatives?`
` .........I won't forgive her......for mocking them even after their deaths........."`
`‘Uryu...uryu......Ange.........’`
`Sakutarou acted nervously.`
` ......As I looked at his worrying face, my agitation began to cool off bit by bit...`
`"I'm sorry...`
` My hatred of {f:5:Beatrice} isn't anything new.`
` ......I'm just surprised and angry to find out that I had a connection with the witch already on that day, at the age of six..."`
`".........For the past twelve years,`
` you have been enslaved by {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's curse.`
` ...This might be proof that this really was a curse.`
` But please, don't fall apart.`
` Part of this journey should be to break through that."`
`"That's right......`
` Just letting the blood rise to my head won't get me anywhere.`
` Got to think calmly.`
` .........What's going on?`
` What's the meaning of handing out a hundred million yen to each of the relatives?`
` Was she trying to provoke us......?`
` Damn that {f:5:Beatrice}........."`
`‘Ange......calm down......`
` ......Uryu......’`
`As Sakutaro buried his head in my stomach, he urged me to stay calm.`
`......I took another deep breath, and started thinking.`
`".........I wonder if the sending of these envelopes was to demonstrate that this was a premeditated crime by {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"They were postmarked right before the family conference.`
` And they were intentionally set up so that they would be sent back after some time."`
`‘......They wanted them to arrive after the incident, is that it......?’`
`"Yeah.`
` That's what it implies.`
` .........But it still leaves me wondering a little.`
` Why such an uncertain method?"`
`"Uncertain?"`
`"Yes.`
` After all, you can't even guess in advance at how many days it would take for the mail to return.`
` ......Normally, you can't even guess at the amount of time it will take for the receiving post office to do the research, make a determination of unknown recipient, and send it back."`
`‘Yeah, now that you mention it......`
` It'd be more certain if they just set an arrival date and mailed it that way......`
` Uryu...’`
`"......Maybe, but still,`
` if they mailed it the day before, then no matter how quickly it returned, it would probably have arrived no earlier than Monday.`
` I wonder if they wanted to make it seem like a letter from the dead."`
`"......A letter from the dead, you say."`
`"......You're right.`
` That surprises you, and makes you feel horrible.`
` ......Some mail with your dead family's names written on the outside in large letters...`
`gets thrown into your mailbox with an ominous label attached."`
`"......However, it doesn't really make sense to me.`
` I would have mailed it to arrive on a specified day.`
` I just can't understand why someone would allow the insecurity of it possibly arriving on a day they weren't anticipating."`
`‘.....................Uryu.`
` ......But that really does sound like Beato to me.’`
`"Huh?`
` You...know about Beato?"`
`‘......Well, I only talked with her a little.`
` ......But somehow I can tell that Beato would do something like this.’`
`‘.........Can't you imagine that too, Mammon?`
` Beato likes pranks like this, right?’`
`"..................`
` .........Yeah, that might be true.`
` ......I wouldn't put it past {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama to try a vicious prank like a letter from the dead."`
`‘No, not just that part.`
` .........{f:5:Beatrice} would find it more fun to do it in a way that was a little bit uncertain, instead of one that was absolutely certain.’`
`".........She would find an uncertain method...more fun...?"`
`I remembered Maria onee‐chan's diary...`
`{n}......It had quite a lot of descriptions of playing with {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`Occasionally, some of these involved Beato playing pranks on the adult relatives with Maria.`
`But those pranks always followed a certain little aesthetic principle of witches.`
`Which was.........that things are more fun if they are uncertain.`
`One day, Maria onee‐chan had brought a wind‐up minicar, and she and Beato decided to use it for a prank.`
`It was a popular toy at the time—if you made the minicar back up, it would wind up the spring in the tires, and when you let go, it would race forwards.`
`They had wound up that minicar and set it in the shadow of a milk jug.`
`......In other words, the prank was that, if you lifted the milk jug, the minicar would jump forwards and surprise whoever did it.`
`Hoping that someone would get caught in this prank, Onee‐chan and Beato had watched the adults from the shadows for their whole teatime.`
`They were looking forward to seeing who would get caught by it, but ultimately, no one moved the trap milk jug, and the trap never went off......`
`When Onee‐chan had then muttered "We should have put it somewhere where they'd definitely get caught by it",`
` Beato apparently said this.`
`She said,`
` "Traps where you don't know who will get caught, or even whether anyone will get caught at all, are more thrilling and fun".`
`......It's probably true that you wouldn't get that kind of excitement from a trap that would definitely catch someone.`
`......This kind of description occurred in multiple places,`
` making it possible to guess that the witch called {f:5:Beatrice} had quite a fickle character and loved a random thrill......`
`A fickle person is very hard to deal with.`
` I can't flip over the chessboard......to find out what that witch from twelve years ago was planning.`
`As Ange thought these things over, her gaze wandered from place to place.`
`Then, she suddenly showed interest in the wall.`
`{n}There, a number of framed photographs were hung.`
`Many were commemorative photos from when the Kumasawas got together as a family or went somewhere to play, and Kumasawa herself was in many of them.`
`...Still with a smile that made it so you could almost hear her lighthearted hoh‐hoh‐ho laugh.`
`......It's a distant memory, but I do remember that she was definitely this sort of cheerful old lady...`
`"Did you notice anything different about Kumasawa‐san in the days leading up to the incident...?"`
`"Nope.`
` She looked the same as ever.`
` .....Grumbling about how tough the family conference was and how it put her on edge, same as always."`
`"............?`
` ......What's this?"`
`Among the numerous frames, there was one that had something other than a picture of people in it.`
`It was a photograph of an enlarged relief of a door from a Western‐style house or something.`
`......I couldn't see any interesting subject in particular, which actually bugged me a bit as I wondered why anyone had gone to all the trouble of taking it.`
`As I got closer, I realized that some text had been written in pen.`
`"......Oh yeah, that's a photo I got when Mom's belongings were distributed.`
` I think it probably has something to do with that "Legend of the Gold" thing."`
`"The witch's epitaph, you mean?`
` Rumored to point to the location of the hidden ten tons of gold...`
` ......So Kumasawa‐san tried to solve it too, I see.`
` But this isn't the epitaph.`
` ......It's the first time I've seen it."`
`There was an arch above the Western‐style door, and that arch had a relief.`
` It was an inscription in English, and that seemed to be the focus of the photograph.`
`The pen writing appeared to be a translation into Japanese.`
`".....................`
` "This door will only open with a probability of 1/1,000,000,000,000,000.`
` You will only be blessed with a probability of 1/1,000,000,000,000,000."`
` .........I don't know it.`
` Nothing like this ever showed up in the epitaph or Onee‐chan's diary."`
`"In Mom's belongings, there were quite a few photos and notebooks that looked like they were from her trying to solve the epitaph's riddle."`
`"Turns out she was actually surprisingly fond of that kind of thing.`
` And there was that rumor that ten tons of gold bars were hidden somewhere.`
` No wonder she was so besotted by it."`
`In both Maria onee‐chan's diary and in her grimoire, there was a description of the witch's epitaph.`
`It mentioned about how it was a ritual to open the door to the Golden Land, and {f:5:Beatrice}'s resurrection ritual, and {f:5:Beatrice}'s succession ceremony.`
` And so on.`
`Maybe the most interesting one was the last line, the succession ceremony.`
`According to {f:5:Beatrice},`
` if you were able to solve the witch's epitaph,`
` you would receive not only the ten tons of gold and the Ushiromiya family inheritance,`
` but her own magical power and name, as well as the title of Golden Witch.`
`Among the Ushiromiya family at the time, the witch's epitaph was thought of as a difficult quiz, which the head, Kinzo, had prepared to select his successor.`
`But in the Mariage Sorcière interpretation, the questioner was {f:5:Beatrice} herself,`
` and she had posed the question in part to choose her successor.`
`......There were slight discrepancies in the details of the two interpretations.`
`Either way, its disturbing contents brought to mind a bloody serial murder,`
` and both of the message bottles depicted a crime that followed that pattern.`
`If I could solve the witch's epitaph now, twelve years later, I wonder if I could expose some plot made back then......`
`I tried to solve it many times myself, but I never did have a clue what it meant.`
`{n}It seems that many Witch Hunters have been trying as well.`
`I also found theories like the La Plata theory and the Enoura theory in certain books.`
`However, none of these theories were conclusive......`
`"Are there any other materials?"`
`"I think so, but they were all split up between my siblings.`
` I don't have a clue who has what.`
` Sorry."`
`".........Just reading this English text that Kumasawa‐san took a picture of, it gives the impression that this was a forbidden door that was rarely opened."`
`"......But where in the mansion is it, I wonder.`
` Judging by the lighting, it looks like it's outside.`
` ......I wonder if Kumasawa‐san suspected that the gold was hidden in there."`
`"Who knows.`
` In any case, it's probably {i:somewhere} in the Rokkenjima mansion.`
` ......It's a pity, but there wasn't the kind of money in Mom's bank account to make me think she found the gold.`
` Uhahahaha, she probably didn't find it after all."`
`......The Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, gave ten tons of gold to Kinzo.`
`Which meant that the witch was the true owner of the gold.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} was the owner of all the vast fortune of the Ushiromiya family.`
`The witch holding this vast wealth had massacred the humans on Rokkenjima on that day,`
` ...and sent large amounts of money to the surviving relatives like it was a game.`
`......Like hell it's a letter from the dead.`
` This is desecration of the dead.`
`I was once again convinced.`
` ......My family, who died on the island that day, didn't die and go to heaven.`
`They're being trapped by the witch even now, and are being desecrated and tormented for all eternity......`
`The last place Ange visited...`
`was a store in a region where residential and commercial areas intermingled, with a signboard saying "Marufuku Sleep Shop"......`
`There lived the man who had been the captain of the ferryboat to Rokkenjima at the time.`
`......Even he, who had once lived as a man of the sea, had retired after contracting a serious illness,`
` and was now being taken care of at the house of his son and his son's wife...`
`"I remember you well...!`
` You were only about yea high.`
` Look at you now...!`
` You must have been absolutely devastated.`
` I understand how you feel, believe me...!"`
`The former boat captain was so full of energy that you couldn't really tell why he had retired in the first place.`
`His memory seemed clear too; he had a good memory of things that had happened more than a decade prior, and it seemed that he could even remember how Ange had been at the time.`
`The lively conversation was very helpful for Ange,`
` ......but at the same time, the captain also remembered the final family conference very well,`
` and the fact that he had detailed memories of even Battler's "gonna fall gonna fall uproar" on the boat was instead painful for Ange.`
`It had been so back then as well, but even now, there was no public way to cross to Rokkenjima.`
`It was necessary to make an individual request to an owner of a boat to make the voyage.`
`I still hadn't managed to arrange for a boat to Rokkenjima,`
` so if he refused me, the voyage to Rokkenjima would probably become hopeless......`
`"No need to explain.`
` It'd be no easy job finding a boat willing to go to that island at this point.`
` ......Nowadays, some of 'em don't even call it Rokkenjima any more, they call it by its old name, Akujikijima.`
` Can't see you getting any sailor round here to help you out."`
`Originally, Rokkenjima had been feared as an island of disaster by the fishermen.`
`And when that incident happened twelve years ago, that fear reached its peak......`
`They respected the sea, feared it, and revered it.`
` There were almost no sailors who would try to take a boat to the cursed island.`
`Because of that, most of the Witch Hunters were unable to cross over to Rokkenjima,`
` and were limited to taking a trip around the island.`
`......Ironically, this caused the mystique surrounding Rokkenjima to increase even more,`
` and resulted in the proliferation of the bizarre witch stories they loved so much...`
`".........Would you take me in your boat?"`
`"Mm.`
` They're sposed to give her back to me just for tomorrow.`
` I hear the engine's been acting up lately, though.`
` We'll crank it up to full throttle!"`
`The former boat captain promised that tomorrow, he would go back to his previous job and take his boat out to Rokkenjima.`
`With this, I'd managed to secure a method of transport to Rokkenjima.`
`{n}This is probably all I can do on Niijima.`
`All that's left is...tomorrow.`
` On Rokkenjima, ......I'll reach the final destination of a journey that stretches back twelve years.`
`‘That's great news...`
` You'll be able to go to the island now...’`
`"Yes.`
` ......I'd heard that it would be hard to find a boat, so the boat captain's cooperation really helped me out."`
`".........Although he may not have been as badly affected as you, Ange‐sama,`
` I'm sure that the incident twelve years ago has been a thorn for the boat captain as well, one that he still hasn't been able to pull out."`
`‘......Uryu.`
` ......Even the captain wasn't able to find closure.`
` This whole time.’`
`"Well, yeah.`
` ......If that guy had taken his boat out on October 5th as promised, there's a chance that he could've saved a great many people.`
` If he hadn't been hesitant with his boat just because of a little wind..."`
`‘Uryu... You shouldn't say things like that...`
` I'm sure that's pained the captain constantly until today......’`
`I heard that it had truly been right in the middle of a typhoon on October 5th.`
`According to the boat captain, he had known for certain that they would be trapped by the typhoon if they headed to Rokkenjima on October 4th.`
`But the family had been very insistent upon that date, which had been determined beforehand as the date of the conference.`
`......It was only natural.`
` All of the adults had their own packed schedules, and had come to the family conference having arranged those schedules in advance.`
`They probably had their own circumstances preventing them from easily pushing it back to next week just because the typhoon was approaching.`
`......It wasn't the boat captain's fault.`
`But perhaps you could say that he didn't feel so guiltless that he could place the blame wholly on the typhoon.`
`Certainly, just as these two said, there's no doubt that the boat captain has been dragging the events of twelve years ago along with him this whole time.`
`......And, by taking me, the last member of the Ushiromiya line, to the island,`
` and bringing me back safely, he might be trying to find some resolution for the past...`
`"The boat's meant to be coming back just after noon.`
` I'll take you to Rokkenjima after that, so we should get there before evening.`
` It's an island without electricity or lights.`
` You won't be able to stay long.`
` ......Is a short trip like that gonna satisfy you?"`
`".....................`
` It's not the kind of thing where staying longer will satisfy me more.`
` I'm grateful just to have you take me there."`
`"Mm, don't mention it.`
` If I hadn't parted with my boat, I wouldn't have to be so stingy, and I'd be able to take you to the island as much as you like..."`
`It's not like I have a goal of doing something in particular on Rokkenjima.`
`{n}So, the time of day I'll be staying there is evening...`
`......The evening, which straddles the two different worlds of day and night, seemed almost like a borderline between this world and the next—`
`or possibly, between 1998 and 1986—and felt like the most fitting time to visit Rokkenjima.`
`......It's not like I'll be doing anything on the island.`
` Staying there for just a few hours will be just fine if I can feel some closure.`
`At that time, there was a small knock on the paper sliding door, and Amakusa stuck his head in, tapping his watch.`
`I nodded back and told him I'd gotten hold of a boat for tomorrow.`
`"That's great.`
` ......It's about time for us to go.`
` We'll be counting on you tomorrow, Captain."`
`"You betcha!`
` I know all about the troubles you've had.`
` I was watching the talk shows at the time, and I was disgusted by all the people stirring up that incident just for fun.`
` I'll help you out any way I can."`
`"Thank you very much.`
` ......Then we'll see you noon tomorrow.`
` Umm, here.`
` The fare for the boat."`
`Ange took a wrapped wad of ten‐thousand yen bills from her pocket.`
`The boat captain must have seen its thickness as well.`
` But he paid it absolutely no interest, and shook his head.`
`"......I'm grateful to you.`
` This is guidance from heaven.`
` I'm being given a final chance to take you to Rokkenjima and bring you back safely."`
`"Now, I'll finally be able to finish the final job Kinzo‐san entrusted me with.`
` So I'm grateful to you.`
` I got more than enough money from Kinzo‐san back then.`
` Can't take it from you."`
`".....................Thank you very much."`
`"Watch your step on the stairs.`
` They're a doozy."`
`......I went down the steep staircase that was the exact opposite of "accessible".`
`It was getting hard to believe that there had actually been a chest of drawers and a TV in the room upstairs.`
`Most of the first floor was a bedding store, with many futons piled up on each other.`
`The captain followed behind us as we weaved our way through the cramped futon shop.`
`After cautiously checking around outside, Amakusa dashed out first and started up the car.`
`"My grandkid's room is empty.`
` I really wouldn't mind if you stayed there.`
` As you can tell, I'm up to my eyes in futons."`
`"Thanks a lot for the offer.`
` ......But I can't cause you trouble if worst comes to worst."`
`".........Dunno your circumstances, but seems to me like you're caught up in a lot of trouble.`
` There's rumors some shady people are on the lookout for someone.`
` Wouldn't happen to be you, would it?"`
`".....................`
` ......How should I know?"`
`Ange played dumb, but it looked as though the boat captain had guessed.`
`"My job was to take visitors to Rokkenjima over to the island, ......and bring them back again."`
`"......That job was interrupted twelve years ago, and it still hasn't been finished.`
` So, thanks to you, I'm finally gonna be able to finish that job."`
`"....................."`
`"So what I'm saying is.`
` .........Please let me finish the job.`
` Do you understand?"`
`"..................`
` ......Yes.`
` It's not like I'm going there to die."`
`But part of me does feel that, if I could die on that island, I would surely be able to go to where my family is......`
`I had finally become aware of it.`
` ......I might have been planning......to die on that island.`
`I might have come all this way, heading for Rokkenjima, in search of a place to die.`
`The boat captain had guessed that as well.`
`{n}And so, for emphasis, he told me again: Don't.`
`".........I won't.`
` I promise.`
` .........In the first place,`
` I'm still unclear about why I even have to go to Rokkenjima, what the purpose is at all."`
`"No, I'm sure there's gotta be one.`
` If there isn't one for you, ...then there is one for {i:them}.`
` The island called you.`
` That's why you came here."`
`".........You might...be right.`
` ...I might......have been called."`
`I was called.`
` For what reason?`
` For them.`
`{n}Mom.`
` Dad.`
` Battler onii‐chan.`
`{n}......And...Maria onee‐chan.`
`.........Or maybe, the Golden Witch.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`What does Rokkenjima have for me?`
`{n}And what will I achieve?`
`Even though tomorrow was almost upon me at last, I still wasn't able to understand my own mission......`
`There was the sound of a car stopping in front of the store, and a short honk could be heard.`
`"Then I'll see you tomorrow.`
` Have a nice evening."`
`"Mm."`
`I got past the stacks of futons in the narrow store, and was about to go outside.`
`{n}............Just then, my feet stopped.`
`"......What is it?"`
`"...........................Uh,`
` ...............umm,`
` what is that......?"`
`"Hmm?`
` That?`
` What?`
` What are you talking about?"`
`Trembling all over, .........I pointed at it.`
`But no matter how much the boat captain squinted, he noticed absolutely nothing in that direction that should have surprised me.`
`......That means,`
` ............th‐......that means............`
`"............Im‐impossible......`
` ...Wh‐why............?"`
`‘U‐.........uryu.........`
` ......Ange,`
` ......why?`
` What's going on......?!’`
`"......I, .........I don't have a clue either......`
` There's no way something that ridiculous......`
` Is this magic?`
` A miracle......?"`
`".........Yes, this is probably fate.`
` ......I just......understood.`
` ............This......was my mission."`
`‘............Uryu...............’`
`"I.........don't have a clue what's........."`
`I was frozen in position, shaking, pointing into the semi‐darkness inside the store......`
`"Wh‐what is it?`
` What's over there?!`
` I don't, ...I don't understand...`
` Wh‐what is it that you see...?!"`
`"Thank you, Captain.`
` ......All of this, all of it,`
` ......it was all fate.`
` Even me visiting this place...`
`...was fate.`
` ............This...`
`......is the mission...and the purpose...that I'm going to Rokkenjima for........."`
`"............Ange‐san?`
` What is it, is something wrong?"`
`"I, I'm as clueless as you...!`
` She's just gone still as a statue, pointing into the darkness...!"`
`"Ange‐san......?`
` Are you alright?`
` What can you see......?"`
`"Can't you two see it?`
` That, right there.`
` ......Can't you see it?!"`
`"All I can see is a normal display case.`
` There's no one there, missy...?"`
`‘Uryu............Ange......`
` ......I don't know what's going on......`
` ......Is this......a dream?`
` Magic......?`
` What's happening......?`
` ...............?`
` ............Ange...............?’`
`Sakutarou lifted his face towards Ange......`
`From her eyes...`
`{Comment:Intentionally left out, doesn't work in English (......ぼろりと、):}`
`...slid a single tear.`
`".........Ange‐sama.................."`
`"......I understand.`
` Onee‐chan.`
` ......And...`
`............{f:5:Beatrice}."`
`‘.........Uryu.........’`
`So {i:this}............is magic.........`
`".........A test......?"`
`"......M‐mm.`
` Listen well..."`
`Once again, there was a call from Krauss to the guesthouse.`
`......And the message was......that Kinzo wanted to hold a test to see if the grandchildren had the qualifications to be the next head.`
`".........The head has said that his successor will not be one of us siblings,`
` that he wants to......pick from you grandchildren..."`
`From Krauss's restrained style of speech, Jessica realized as his daughter that he was being forced to speak.`
`And she was forced into the realization that the hostages were being exposed to danger even now,`
` and that if they refused this test, there was a possibility that the hostages would be harmed.`
`"S‐......so......`
`what should we do?"`
`"......M‐...mm.`
` Hold on..."`
`Krauss held the receiver away from his ear, then looked at the grinning Kinzo on the other side of the bars.`
`Kinzo gave his next order.`
`"Before the test, those unrelated must be removed.`
` .........Gohda and Kumasawa are there, I believe?`
` It will be a problem if they interfere with the test.`
` Banish them from the guesthouse."`
`".........Banish, ...you say......?"`
`"There should be a gardening storehouse in the rose garden.`
` Lock Gohda and Kumasawa in there.`
` Hmm, we'll begin from there.`
` Tell them to do it immediately."`
`".........My weapons will be watching.`
` Should they do anything questionable, I'll instantly stop the test and execute all of you as sacrifices!"`
`"......I, ......I understand......`
` ......Hello, Jessica...`
` Listen closely to what I'm going to tell you......"`
`Krauss relayed to Jessica the orders to lock up Gohda and Kumasawa......`
`"......What kind of test are you planning?"`
`"Hmm?`
` Aah, it truly is a simple test.`
` I will simply have my grandchildren show me their resolve.`
` Well now, I wonder what kind of results they'll show me.`
` ......Hehehahahah."`
`With displeasure, Kyrie watched Krauss, who was talking with the children...`
`......It's regrettable, but for now we can't refuse orders.`
`In this dungeon, a feeble resistance won't amount to anything.`
`If we provoke him too much and drive him into a position where he might kill us,`
` there will no longer be any way to stop this murderer.`
`......For now, the only choice left is to obey his rules without agitating him,`
` all the while waiting for a chance......`
`However, if we continue to obediently follow his commands,`
` the children might be attacked in this so‐called test, and they might even lose their lives.`
`.........Whether we feign obedience or try to resist, ......nothing will cause the situation to improve.`
`Anyway, keeping our eyes peeled so that we don't let a single chance escape until the very end...is the only resistance possible now.`
`......While telling herself this, Kyrie watched over Krauss as he delivered Kinzo's orders......`
`".........Kyrie‐san.`
` Let us be patient......"`
`"I know.`
` ......It's unfortunate, but all we can do right now is wait.`
` If we can just do something about these bars, we'll be able to get back to the mansion......"`
`"......If only we could somehow get out of here...`
` ......I‐I'll try something.`
` ...............Kinzo‐san, I have a request."`
`"Hm, what is it, my friend?"`
`"We understand well that you want to test the children...`
` ......It is fine for you to do things as you desire."`
`"Without your power, the Ushiromiya family might have collapsed long ago.`
` We truly understand why you want to carefully select the person who will take charge.`
` Besides, that is what the family conference is about.`
` We won't get in your way..."`
`"Hmm.`
` I am glad to have your understanding.`
` That's right, this is the family conference.`
` The final family conference, where I will select and finalize the next head.`
` Fuhaha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!"`
`"So, the thing is, Kinzo‐san...`
` ......It is far too cold here.`
` We won't interfere with your test, so couldn't you take us to a slightly warmer place......?"`
`".................."`
`At Nanjo's words, the slight signs that Kinzo's mood had been improving were blown away.`
`A moment of silence struck Nanjo as Kinzo glared at him with dangerous eyes, as though evaluating him......`
`"......Certainly, this place is cold.`
` It's tough on an old body.`
` ......My lord.`
` Wouldn't it be alright if we moved them upstairs......?"`
`"That is not happening!!`
` I don't think so, Nanjoooooo...`
` I know how truly elegantly you lay the foundations for future moves as you appear to give me a turn's breathing room.`
` I'm not falling for that, ohhhhhh noooo...`
` If you insist you're freezing, then I will line the floor with red‐hot coals!!"`
`"M‐my apologies......"`
`{f:5:Virgilia} had tried to help out too, but in the end, Kinzo was having none of it...`
`"...............You two sure are obedient.`
` ...If you felt like it, you could easily break these bars."`
`"..........................."`
`"......Even if we break these, nothing will come of it."`
`"True.`
` ......If you were to break these, it would mean the end of {f:5:Goldsmith}'s game.`
` ......All of you, as well as those humans in the guesthouse, would immediately become sacrifices for Kinzo's ritual."`
`"......But, you know, you two might be the only ones.`
` Who hold the power to break through this situation......right?"`
`".........You want to reach the Golden Land, don't you?`
` You must have many dreams you want granted, right...?`
` *chuckle*......"`
`".............................."`
`"Gaap.`
` You mustn't provoke them.`
` ......This is not your game.`
` It is the Master's game, and Milady's."`
`".........What is it, Ronove?"`
`"Oh, no, nothing.`
` ......We were chatting with the prisoners.`
` Forgive us."`
`Gaap sent one final sneering smile at Kanon, then turned away.`
`Kanon could only bite his lower lip and shake his fists......`
`".....................`
` ......Dammit........."`
`"......Well done......`
` Good job holding it in......"`
`"We're powerless......`
` Because we're furniture......"`
`"That's right, ......we're powerless.`
` ......But there are times when furniture is needed, and even loved."`
`"......We're stored away in the basement right now, that's all.`
` ......I'm sure that one day, somebody will love us.`
` Need us.`
` ......So, for now, let's ignore their provocations and bear with it...`
` ......Okay?"`
`"......Father.`
` I've ordered them to lock up Gohda and Kumasawa in the storehouse."`
`"Good.`
` You may hang up now.`
` ......Chiester Sisters.`
` Observe the grandchildren as they lock Gohda and Kumasawa away.`
` If they do anything suspicious, ......then in that moment, the selection test for my successor will be over."`
`When Kinzo made his order, the Chiester Sisters appeared behind him in a line.`
`"Understood, sir.`
` ......I will scout.`
` {ruby:Five‐five‐six:556} and 410, cover both flanks.`
` 45, wide‐area surveillance."`
`"00...`
` 556 is......"`
`"Ah, ............that's right.`
` Sorry."`
`"She was a good kid......"`
`"......That's why I don't like them nyeh.`
` ...Good people."`
`"What are you doing, Chiester Sisters?!`
` Carry out my orders!"`
`"...............My apologies, sir.`
` Then, let us go observe.`
` ......Move out!"`
`The Chiester Sisters erased their forms simultaneously.`
`Nanjo and Kyrie witnessed the instants they appeared and disappeared as if by teleportation,`
` but they interpreted this as if they had probably moved in and out of the darkness in a way that only looked like teleportation,`
` and the two could do nothing but rub their eyes...`
`"......Well then.`
` I shall begin preparing for the test.`
` Ronove, Gaap.`
` I'm asking you to be the examiners.`
` {f:5:Virgilia}, you watch these rats.`
` .........After all, two of my furniture are here.`
` Just in case, be on your guard."`
`He glanced sharply at Shannon and Kanon.`
` Tightly closing her eyes, Shannon gave a silent bow, answering wordlessly that she would not cause any trouble......`
`"......Certainly.`
` I'll be careful."`
`"Isn't this cold hard on your old body, Lia?`
` Should I bring you a hot water bottle...?"`
`"Shut up.`
` Hurry up and go.`
` Gap."`
`"Pu ku ku ku...!`
` Well, well, tests and examiners, what a strange experience we have this game.`
` .........I do hope this development entertains Milady."`
`"......Come, arise, goat attendants."`
`{f:5:Virgilia} called out into the dark, and from that spot, three massive goat‐headed attendants slowly melted into vision.`
`"Ah, Riiche's minions.`
` How useful.`
` And they look so warm.`
` I see, so this is instead of a hot water bottle.`
` In that case, wouldn't sheep have been better than goats?"`
`"Shut up about it, you cashmere mop.`
` ......They aren't very bright, but they faithfully follow orders and are quite dependable."`
`"Mm, I leave it to you.`
` My friend, {f:5:Virgilia}.`
` ......The rest of you, follow me."`
`Kinzo turned with a grand swish of his cloak.`
`Following him were Ronove and Gaap,`
` ......as well as the three recently summoned goat attendants.`
`"......You three are supposed to wait here with me.`
` Don't follow them."`
`The goats jumped in surprise and then came plodding back.`
`Kyrie, who had been watching in disbelief as all of this played out, couldn't help but snort.`
`"Heheh......`
` What entertaining underlings."`
`"L‐Lord {f:5:Goldsmith} did not give you permission to speak freely."`
`...She was probably a little embarrassed.`
`{f:5:Virgilia} had spoken coldly, but Kyrie could see right through that, and for a little while, she couldn't restrain her muffled laughter.`
`However, on the inside, Kyrie was surprised at the number of people Kinzo had with him.`
`Because, including Kinzo himself, at least ten enemies had already been spotted...`
`......The dungeon they were currently locked in was supposedly underneath the hidden mansion called Kuwadorian.`
`Although this mansion's existence had been whispered of, not even Krauss had known it for a fact until today.`
`Were there actually several facilities like this on Rokkenjima, unknown to all but Kinzo,`
` hiding untold numbers of henchmen that only Kinzo knew of...?`
`Just how many humans are on Rokkenjima, locked away by the typhoon...?`
`No, actually...`
`Are we the only ones under the impression that there are only 18 people on this island......?`
`As we bickered over whether {f:5:Beatrice} existed or not, and racked our brains over something as minor as a 19th person,`
` were we on this island the perfect example of frogs in a well...?`
`No, wait, in fact...`
` At this point, are there actually more people on the enemy's side than on ours...?`
`"............Just what the hell is going on......`
` Witches? Demons? Magic?`
` ......Am I supposed to believe in those?`
` Are my eyes screwed up? Or is my head?`
` ...I think I'm losing it........."`
`A mass murder by magic.`
`{n}Demons forming and disappearing in thin air.`
`More importantly than the enemy's numbers,`
` how should we interpret the various things thrust before our eyes that cannot be explained with the common sense of this world?`
`......Kyrie started to feel like she didn't know what was going on anymore,`
` and while desperately battling the urge to abandon everything and give up, she clenched her teeth in an attempt to hold onto her sanity...`
`Obviously, Gohda and Kumasawa were quite unwilling to be locked in the rose garden shed.`
`......But they had been threatened that, if they resisted, the hostages' safety could not be guaranteed...`
`It was fairly hard to get them to agree,`
` but once the idea was raised that their safety might actually be guaranteed if the key to the gardening storehouse was to be handed to them through a cracked‐open window after they were shut inside,`
` ......and it was suggested that blankets and food could be carried in for them, they were finally convinced.`
`".........This place is pretty chilly...`
` I wonder how long we'll have to stay locked in here......"`
`"......In the worst case, it'll be until Monday morning, so a full day and night.`
` ......I really feel bad about doing this to you two..."`
`George and Battler cleared a space on the floor, then spread the blankets there.`
`{n}They also left the canned food, crackers, and other light snacks they had brought.`
`"It'll be hard for you guys to go until Monday morning with just this...`
` If only we could have stopped by the kitchen..."`
`"We were told not to go to any unnecessary places.`
` ......They do apparently have us under surveillance, after all.`
` .........Dammit."`
`"......I am honestly sorry that we cannot be of any use......`
` And these are the times that we are truly supposed to be at your sides........."`
`"It can't be helped.`
` ......More importantly, we're trusting you to take care of Kumasawa‐san.`
` ...We don't know what's going to happen.`
` When it comes down to it, I want you to do what you can to help her.`
` And more than anything, I want you to be safe..."`
`"...Yes, I understand.`
` ......Please, be careful, everyone.`
` Right now, the Master is......taking human lives like they're pieces on a chessboard.`
` ...Please be careful."`
`Gohda stared at the floor, remembering that atrocity in the dining hall, even now unable to believe what had happened,`
` and he hung his head in shame at his inability to fully describe that terror.`
`"Thank you.`
` .........Please make sure you stay on your guard.`
` You too, Kumasawa‐san."`
`"......And you all please take care as well......`
` I don't have any idea what's going on anymore......"`
`"Well then, ......we'll be off.`
` Let's go, Battler‐kun. Jessica‐chan.`
` ......Come on, Maria‐chan, you too."`
`"............Uu."`
`Looking at the painful expression on the faces of the pair to be imprisoned, it became hard to close the shutter.`
`But we can't disobey.`
`{n}......We're being watched.`
`We brought the shutter down and locked it.`
`{n}Then George headed to the small window on the side of the storehouse.`
`It was a small latticed window which could only be used for light and ventilation.`
`It looked like something from a jail, making the two of them seem even more pitiable,`
` ......but on the other hand, it would protect them from Kinzo and his subordinates, or so one would hope...`
`He opened the window and called out.`
`"......Are you alright? You're not cold, are you?"`
`"We're alright.`
` We've been given all these blankets, after all.`
` ......If we wrap ourselves up, we'll be just fine."`
`"I wish we could have brought them a kerosene stove or something......"`
`"......But it wouldn't have ventilation here.`
` It's tough, but there's nothing we can do now.`
` ......Hostages are being held against us.`
` We can't disobey..."`
`".........Dammit...`
` ......If we could just save Kyrie‐san and the rest somehow......"`
`"Shh.`
` ......They might be able to hear you.`
` .........Gohda‐san, here.`
` The key to the shutter."`
`George threw the key in through the tiny window.`
`"......Thank you.`
` I'll hold on to it."`
`Gohda took the key, and after showing it to Kumasawa, placed it in his own pocket.`
`There was only one key to the gardening shed's shutter.`
`{n}That was being held by those who were locked up inside it.`
`If the children had held onto it, then if it was stolen from them by some chance, that would risk exposing the lives of those in the shed to danger.`
`And even with the key, the shutter could not be opened from the inside.`
` It satisfied Kinzo's demand.`
`However, there was now no longer any way to open the shed from the outside either.`
` This would protect them.`
`Kinzo had ordered that they be confined, ......and we could do nothing but trust that this cold locked room would protect them.`
`Holding Maria's hand, Jessica watched George hand over the key, then looked over the thickets in the pitch‐black rose garden.`
`......Somewhere in this darkness, somebody was hiding, watching to see whether they obeyed orders or not.`
`Of course, merely pointing their flashlights out there did nothing to make any suspicious silhouettes appear.`
`But somebody was surely out there...hiding and watching.`
`They were hit many times with an urge to scream at them.`
`{n}......But they held that back through reason.`
`The four children left the area behind, repeatedly looking back over their shoulders.`
`The feeble light from the lightbulb in the gardening storehouse was seeping out slightly.`
`......Was it at all possible that this insane incident would somehow come to an end, ......so that they could see those two again?`
`......To George, who had closed the shutter himself,`
` ...the resistance of the lock made it feel as though he had killed them with his own hands.`
`".........But even so......we can't disobey......"`
`"A {i:test}...?`
` ......What the hell, old man......!`
` Killing Mom, capturing Dad for that......`
` I don't get it, I'll kill him...!"`
`"......It's alright, Jessica onee‐chan.`
` There's nothing to be sad about......"`
`".........Maria......"`
`"The witch will be revived very soon.`
` .........It won't be long before you can see her in the Golden Land.`
` ...Kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi............`
` Ouch."`
`"Don't laugh at inappropriate times.`
` ......Seriously, a resurrection ritual for a witch?`
` He should just keep his fantasies to the inside of his head.`
` Getting all these people involved...`
` ........That's gonna cost you, ...bastard..."`
`".........Let's return to the guesthouse.`
` ...It'll be bad if we aren't there when Grandfather calls."`
`Urged on by George, everyone began walking towards the guesthouse......`
`At that moment, Jessica spun around, and roared towards the darkness of the rose garden.`
`"..................HEY!!`
` Someone's watching, right?!`
` Tell the old man...!!`
` Tell him I'm gonna friggin' kill him!!`
` Let's go...!!"`
`Of course, there was no reply, only the howl of the wind and rain......`
`The children returned to the guesthouse...`
`{n}...In fear of what would be waiting for them when they got back.`
`After they departed,`
` .........from the exact point in the darkness that Jessica had yelled at,`
` two rabbit ears sprung up...`
`"......S‐sorsorsorryyyy...!`
` They found me ouuuut...!!"`
`"It's 'cause you're too slow, 45, nye~h.`
` Ni~hihihi~, Pendragon‐sama's going to scold youu~{p:0:♪}"`
`"I'm sorry I'm sorry, please don't tell Pendragon‐sama on meeeee!"`
`"Shut up be quiet.`
` It was obviously just a bluff.`
` ...Gohda and Kumasawa's imprisonment confirmed.`
` Mission accomplished.`
` Time to report back."`
`"Neener‐neener.`
` Nihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!`
` Ouch."`
`"Do you want us all stuck on nothing but carrots and water because of collective responsibility?`
` ......Let's go."`
`It certainly seemed to be a fact that they were being watched.`
`Because once they returned to the cousins' room, turned the lights on, and lay down on their beds, the phone rang again.`
`Up until now, Jessica had been answering the phone, seeing as it was her house,`
` but now it was George, as the eldest, who picked it up.`
`This time, Kyrie‐san was on the other end of the phone.`
`{n}George handed it to Battler out of consideration...`
`".........Hello.`
` Kyrie‐san?`
` Is everything alright over there...?!"`
`"Thanks for worrying.`
` ...It's agreeable for now.`
` .....................Sorry, I've been ordered to refrain from speaking freely.`
` Listen closely to what I'm about to tell you."`
`The fact that they were hostages still hadn't changed.`
`{n}And Kinzo or one of his subordinates was probably listening to this conversation.`
`Battler restrained the urge to talk about other things, and focused on what Kyrie had to say.`
`"The tests will be given to Jessica‐chan, George‐kun, Battler‐kun,`
` and Maria‐chan, in that order.`
` .........You'll be called out in turn, so until then, do not leave the room.`
` The person who is called out will head to their designated location, alone."`
`Battler repeated it out loud so that his cousins would also understand.`
`"......Jessica, Aniki, me, and Maria in that order, stay in the room until we're called, right.`
` ......Got it...`
` ......Maria too?`
` Even a nine year old girl... What's that old fart going to force her to do, goddammit..."`
`"...............The future of the Ushiromiya family rests in all of your hands.`
` ......Do your best."`
`"......Hm.`
` ...............Sure."`
`Battler noticed the strange nuance in Kyrie's words.`
`{n}Even without any blood connection, he could still understand thanks to the long‐lasting bond they shared.`
`Now was not the time to worry about the future of the Ushiromiya family.`
`{n}......That wasn't the message that Kyrie wanted to send.`
`She probably meant "there is no way for us to escape from this dungeon, and we can only wait to be rescued.`
` Our lives are in your hands".`
`......Something like that.`
`"Yeah, leave it to us.`
` No idea what kind of test it is, but bring it on.`
` I'm not backing down from that challenge.`
` .........It's a serious test, right?`
` ...It's OK for us to...`
`...go all out?"`
`"......Yes.`
` It's a serious test.`
` He plans to {i:seriously} test you all."`
`"That's no good, no goddamn good at all.`
` ......Some old fart on death's door thinks he can take me when I'm serious?"`
`"Let's see him spew that shit from beyond the grave.`
` He's there, so tell him this for me:`
` The next head is me.`
` And my first action will be to implant my fist into your face...!"`
`Even without Kyrie having to repeat it, Battler's powerful declaration of war reached Kinzo's ears...`
`"Fuhahahahahahahaha!!`
` Battleeeeer, I will truly be looking forward to it!"`
`"I can't wait to see just what a man who once discarded the Ushiromiya name has attained,`
` to just what state of mind he has ascended as he stands before me!!`
` Tell him that...!"`
`Unfortunately, Kinzo's voice was not picked up by the receiver.`
` So Kyrie spoke for him.`
`"He says he's more than up for the challenge.`
` .....Alright, Battler‐kun.`
` There's no need to hold back.`
` .........You are Rudolf‐san's son."`
`"......No, you are my son.`
` Show me something I won't be embarrassed to brag about.`
` .........I entrust everything to you......"`
`"Roger that, Mom.`
` .........Leave the rest to us...!"`
`".........All of us here have lost the right to inherit the position of head.`
` ......Now we're just the same as pieces taken off the chessboard, looking on from the outside.`
` So you'll have to fight by yourselves."`
`"...............Kyrie‐san........."`
`The nuance of those words was.........`
`"We've already given up.`
` ...You can forget about us."`
`......But.........for that very reason, I won't give up......`
`{n}I'm going to wreck this test or whatever, and save everyone...!`
`"Well then, ......here are the instructions for the first test, Jessica‐chan's.`
` ......Head to your own room, he says."`
`"Own room?"`
`"It seems he means Jessica's personal room in the mansion."`
`".........I'll hand it over to Jessica.`
` Tell her directly.`
` ......Jessica."`
`"He‐hello......`
` ............Okay, ...I understand..."`
`"............Me first, huh...`
` ......I'm ready.`
` Be right back!"`
`In actuality, Jessica was probably feeling the fear of a girl her age.`
`......But she buried those feelings and strengthened her resolve.`
`"Be careful, ......okay?"`
`"......We're being watched, right?`
` We can't do anything.`
` All we can do is exactly as we're told."`
`".........They say that old geezer killed those six in the dining hall in an instant, with no hesitation.`
` ......It might be the same for us."`
`"I get it.`
` ............I'll pay him back."`
`"Don't do anything reckless.`
` .........If you think you're in any danger, you put yourself first.`
` ......If Uncle Krauss finds out that his daughter sacrificed herself for him,`
` there's no doubt it would tear his heart apart."`
`"It goes the other way too.`
` .........If Mom and Dad were both killed, and I was the only one left,`
` my heart would rip itself to pieces."`
`"..............................`
` ......Battler‐kun.`
` Is what you said earlier true......?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Kyrie‐san and the others are already......prepared for what will happen."`
`"Then I'm even more sure I'm ready.`
` ......Their lives rest on our shoulders.`
` The hostages can't do anything while locked up.`
` So it's up to us to do something about it."`
`".........If anything happens, run back to the guesthouse.`
` At that time, we'll be done playing along with Grandfather's game."`
`"Aniki........."`
`"At that time, we will declare war.`
` .........Wherever they're locked up, we'll save them, and we'll see that Grandfather gets what he deserves."`
`"......Are you sure, Aniki?`
` ......Shannon‐chan's there too."`
`"........................`
` ......That doesn't mean I'll sit around and wait for my fiancée to be killed.`
` .........What scares me is not that Shannon might be killed by Grandfather."`
`"{i:I'm just worried you guys will be first to find that doddering old bastard who gave my fiancée a taste of terror, and literally beat me to the punch}."`
`"Now I get it...`
` ......Yeah, this really is a test to settle who the next head's gonna be."`
`"Yep.`
` ......The first one to bury a fist into that old geezer's face is the successor."`
`George, Battler, and Jessica each forcefully nodded their heads and put their fists together.`
`Then Jessica headed off to her own room, as designated......`
`Her form disappeared into the darkness of the rose garden, which was shaking in the violent winds.`
`......As they saw her off, George and Battler hardened their trembling fists.....`
`Jessica's back was watched through the window by Maria, who had remained upstairs.`
`Her expression was blank......`
`"......I wonder why everyone is getting so upset.`
` .........When {f:5:Beatrice} is revived, we can get her to bring everyone back to life."`
`Jessica's form had already been completely swallowed up by the darkness.`
`......At that time, the phone began to ring again.`
`Battler and George heard it and came clamoring back, but Maria picked up the receiver right away.`
`"...............Hello."`
`"M‐......Maria‐sama...?`
` It's Shannon.`
` ......Would you please hand the phone to George‐sama?"`
`This time, it was Shannon on the phone.`
`And the purpose of the message was to tell the next person, George, where he was to go......`
`It goes without saying, but since the time she was born, ......Jessica was raised in this mansion.`
`The Western‐style house that the cousins simply called "the mansion" was her home.`
`And yet, she had never understood her cousins' feelings as much as she did today.`
`......And at the same time, her own home, which she knew well, had never felt so different a place as it did now......`
`Her own.........room.`
`This had once been her personal hideaway, the only place in this vast mansion where she could feel at peace.`
`However, ......that door had never felt as intimidating as it did now.`
`".........A test, he says...?`
` Tch, what the hell has he got waiting in there......`
` He better not have ransacked my desk and stuff......"`
`She acted tough, trying to deceive herself.`
`{n}......Trying to make herself believe that she wasn't scared of anything.`
`She readied herself, and opened the door to her room.`
`"...................................."`
`......When she saw that, fortunately, the room didn't appear to have been messed with, she relaxed.`
`No one......was there.`
` ......Of course.`
`{n}There was nowhere for anyone to hide here.`
`Right away, Jessica locked the door behind her.`
`{n}......Now the room was safe.`
`She peeked under the bed and in the closet, but of course, no one was hiding.`
`"......Wh‐......what the hell.`
` ...Haha, ...haha...!"`
`She looked at the clock.`
` ......Ten past eleven, or just a little past that.`
`As her tension lessened and fatigue came back to her entire body, she realized how messed up this whole day had been.`
`It was still only eleven.`
`......The plan had been for all the cousins to get together, have fun playing around, and talk animatedly about all kinds of things together into the night.`
`Normally, we would have been doing that kind of thing at this very moment.`
`{n}Why has that......turned into this......?`
`".........It's all that old bastard's fault......`
` ......How could he do that...to Mom......`
`to everyone........."`
`Her head was swimming with anger and sadness......`
` But there was no one here to direct those emotions at.`
`......Because of the lock, this room's security was guaranteed.`
`{n}Remembering that one more time, Jessica somehow regained her calm......`
`If it keeps up like this and nothing happens...`
`{n}Jessica thought that she would like to go to the dining hall and see her mother's last face.`
`......Even though Gohda had emphasized so strongly that it was gruesome and that she definitely shouldn't look at it,`
` even so, she wanted to see her mother's face one final time...`
`But they had been warned repeatedly that doing anything stupid would put the hostages in danger.`
`......Could it be that locking the door was also against the rules......?`
`If I close myself up in here, I alone might be saved.`
`......But if I don't open it, it will surely be against the rules, and Dad, Kanon‐kun, Shannon, Auntie Kyrie, and Doctor Nanjo...`
`will be killed.`
`............There's no way the scales balance between five lives and my own one life.`
`Jessica tightly shut her eyes, resisting the other part of herself which said "Isn't it alright as long as {i:I} survive?",`
` ......headed to the door, and made to unlock it.`
`......Just then.`
`Clap, clap, clap......`
`A crisp applause rang out, making Jessica's heart leap...`
`"If the door had remained locked, it might have been in violation of the rules, and harm could have come to the hostages.`
` ......But even so, your own life might be saved."`
`"However, you resisted that temptation and were about to unlock the door yourself.`
` That bravery of yours is worthy of admiration."`
`"Wh‐who..............."`
`I, the owner of this room,`
` ......had searched to make sure there was nowhere any human could have been hiding...`
` .........Where had this...man...`
`.........There was nowhere for a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} to hide,`
` ......but could something that wasn't {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} have managed it.........?`
`I was pretty sure this was my first meeting with this largely built, middle‐aged man.`
` ......I did not recognize this guy, who looked like a butler and bore the seal of the One‐winged Eagle.`
`"A pleasure to meet you, Jessica‐sama.`
` .........I serve as head furniture for the Master, the 27th of the 72.`
` I am called Ronove."`
`"......Rono...ue......?`
` ............Genji...san............?"`
`"......Ah, yes, ...Genji is like my little brother.`
` Or perhaps he was my true form in this world.`
` ......Perhaps you could even say he was a vessel."`
`".........What's...this guy...saying.........?"`
`"Oh, my apologies.`
` This is not something that can be explained to a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` .........Well then, let us move on to the main event."`
`"So this is that old crackpot's...`
`...test or whatever........."`
`"Correct.`
` This is the test that the Master has granted you."`
`At Ronove's elegant gesture, like that of a butler ordering for the meal to be set out,`
` many gold butterflies flew up out of nowhere......`
`"Gwah?!`
` What the...hell......?!"`
`The swarm of gold butterflies spun around, forming a small swirl as they gathered in one place.`
`......Then, that golden mound disappeared like a pile of leaves blown away by a cold wintry wind,`
` ......and there lay a Western envelope with the One‐winged Eagle crest done on it in gold leaf......`
`Ronove gestured to her to pick it up.`
`{n}Jessica timidly picked it up, and opened the letter inside......`
`".....................What is...this......?"`
`"It is an exceedingly simple test that looks for the qualifications for becoming the next head.`
` ......Please attend to the question written there with the readiness of the next head who will bear responsibility for the Ushiromiya family,`
` and tell me your answer, as well as the thoughts that led you to it."`
`"......Wh‐............what the...utter hell..............."`
`Shaking, Jessica looked back and forth between the paper and Ronove's face several times......`
`......At that time, George, who had been called out after Jessica, could be seen in the arbor of the rose garden.`
`He had been planning to give Shannon the ring that would be proof of their engagement...here, tonight, at this time...if things had gone normally.`
`...But the woman in front of George now was not Shannon.`
`"......Read it.`
` That is {f:5:Goldsmith}'s test for you."`
`".............................."`
`George picked up the Western envelope on the table where he had once drunk tea with Shannon,`
` and read its contents......`
`Perhaps its message was short.`
` After a single glance at it, George's eyes grew sharp.`
`"............What is this...`
`supposed to be?"`
`"Ehheheheheh.`
` ......It's what it looks like.`
` This is the test given to you, to find if you have the qualifications to be the successor to the head.`
` ......Ask yourself what makes you qualified to be the successor, as you answer the question."`
`".........What a...stupid question."`
`"I agree.`
` It really is a stupid question.`
` .........In that case, isn't the Ushiromiya family headship something just as trivial in {f:5:Goldsmith}'s eyes?`
` ......Heheheh."`
`George lowered his eyes to the surface of the letter once again, and examined its contents......`
`George and Jessica.`
` ......While the tests given to them were slightly different, they were almost exactly the same.`
`"......‘Among the three mentioned below.`
` In order to gain two, sacrifice one.’"`
`"It's a simple three‐choice test.`
` .........Decide for yourself which one you will choose not to save."`
`"If you refuse to choose, the test is suspended.`
` I have been given permission to kill you right here by my own hands.`
` .........If you would include even that as a choice, then there are four choices."`
`"It's been an awful long time since I've gotten to play with a kid like you, so I can't say I'd be disappointed."`
`".........Are these three choices only a test?`
` Or will the choice be accompanied by its result?"`
`"Don't be naive.`
` ......The one you choose will definitely lose their life."`
`"......................................."`
`{a:c:{e:070:Among the three mentioned below.`
`{n}In order to gain two, sacrifice one.`
`{n}{n}1. Your life`
`{n}2. Shannon's life`
`{n}3. Everyone else's lives`
`{n}{n}If you do not choose one, all of the above will be lost.}}`
`"...............Why is Shannon's name here?"`
`"The second choice has the name of the one most needed by that person, and most loved.`
` ......I believe Kanon's name is written second on Jessica's test."`
`".........You gave this stupid question to Jessica too...?"`
`"*giggle*giggle*.`
` ......What does Jessica matter?`
` Right now, you are the one being tested."`
`"It really is a simple three‐choice test.`
` Which can you throw away for the sake of the other two?`
` ......Isn't that simple?`
` If you still can't decide, would you like me to lend you a coin......?"`
`"......A coin?`
` How would you choose between three options with something that only has two sides?"`
`"There's no one who would throw away their own life.`
` ......So naturally only two options remain.`
` Will you give up on everyone for the sake of the one you love?`
` Or will you give up on the one person you love so that you can save as many people as possible?"`
`"Either way, you can fit it with an appropriate just cause.`
` After all, this Rokkenjima is now a demon island.`
` ......The sickly sweet buddy‐buddy pretense of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world is not necessary.`
` No one will blame you.`
` Do as your heart desires."`
`"......While asking yourself whether you possess the fitting qualifications to succeed the headship of the Ushiromiya family...`
` No, make your decision as though you yourself {i:are} the Ushiromiya family head.`
` Ehheheheheh......"`
`".........................................."`
`".........What.........the hell do you take me for............"`
`Jessica crumpled the letter up and threw it on the floor.`
`"I believe your anger is quite appropriate.`
` ......I also find it an exceedingly pitiful, and truly ludicrous question.`
` ......Pu ku ku ku."`
`"Like hell there's anyone who could wish for their own death.`
` And...like hell there's anyone who could want to remain alive after abandoning the life of the person they l‐...love.`
` ......And......like hell there's anyone who could massacre everyone else......as long as it's good for the two of them......!"`
`"No, Jessica‐sama.`
` Such a person could exist."`
`"This is Rokkenjima, the demon island!`
` It is now completely cut off from the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world and dunked fully into the netherworld like cheese fondue.`
` The values of the human world will be taken out with the trash."`
`"Pu ku ku!`
` So please.`
` Choose the things you desire from the bottom of your heart, in the order you desire them.`
` Whatever remains will be your answer, and one most fitting for this insane night."`
`"Screw you!!`
` How could I......choose any of these?!!"`
`"‘If you do not choose one, all of the above will be lost’...`
`also makes for a fine fourth choice.`
` It may also be interesting if that one is chosen."`
`"But since choosing that will result in the loss of your own life in the end, I believe it would be more wise to do the honorable thing and select number one, "your life",`
` so that the other two will be saved.`
` ......All is entrusted to your decision, Jessica‐sama."`
`"Please, let me hear an answer and conviction fitting for the successor to the Ushiromiya family......!!`
` I am sincerely hoping for a wonderful answer, fitting for the Master's descendant who shares his blood!!"`
`"Da‐......damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittt......"`
`That scene was being observed through a magic crystal ball being held by Kinzo.`
`Kinzo finally couldn't hold it back; spreading his arms and facing the heavens, he began laughing in an explosive voice......`
`"Fuhahahahahahaha, waahha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!`
` Why do you hesitate, foolish grandchildren and descendants of mine!!"`
`"This is a simple problem that can be answered immediately!`
` It should cause less vacillation than whether to put butter or jam on your morning toast!!`
` ......Do you people know the correct answer?"`
`He turned and stared wide‐eyed at the Chiester Sisters, who had been faithfully standing in wait behind him.`
`"N‐no, no, my apologies, I don't know, Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}!"`
`"Fool, not choosing at all means GAME OVEE{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}EEER!!!`
` You foolish rabbit, who cannot even choose a reason or a goal for her own life...!!"`
`"You have not the value of a single ant that anyone might step upon without even noticing!!`
` Die! Be crushed!! Disappear faster than I can blink!!`
` ......And what of you?"`
`"......I would sacrifice the first one, "my life", sir.`
` Weapons exist to fight and die in battle.`
` And weapons exist to destroy enemies and protect allies.`
` If we can die protecting those we love, we can die satisfied, sir."`
`"Hoh.`
` A truly splendid model answer for a weapon.`
` The immediate reply is very nice.`
` ......Have you been taught that you'll be given an extra carrot for answering that way?`
` Heheheheh, that's not it, is it noowwwwww?`
` Even that isn't it, is it noww{-}w{-}w{-}w{-}w{-}w{-}wwww...?"`
`"You are merely answering the way you have been told to answer, repeating the answer you have been indoctrinated with!!`
` You are the same as that other rabbit a second ago.`
` You still live without having chosen a purpose or a goal to live for...!!`
` Filth whose life has no value...!`
` It would fit you well to crush you down and use you as fodder for the other livestock!!"`
`"...............`
` ...Yes sir!`
` A‐animal fodder...would be an honor......!"`
`"I don't think sooooo!`
` You don't want to see anyone else die anymore, doooo youuuu?`
` Why can't you accept that?`
` Accept that your old wounds are still festering and rotting deep, deep inside...!"`
`"Yes, the rotting stench almost makes the nose wrinkle, you foolish rotten rabbit!!`
` These are words of praise for you!!"`
`".........Th‐thank you very much...sir......"`
`"Well then, what about you, the last one.`
` Which of the three choices would you choose...?"`
`"Nihi.`
` Number two without hesitation."`
`"Hoh...`
` Number two.`
` There are not many who could proudly choose to offer "the one you love" as a sacrifice.`
` Tell me your reason."`
`"Because the one you love will be lost eventually.`
` If you don't have anyone to love, you won't be hurt, and even then, you still might be able to love someone again someday.`
` So,`
` the person you love right now isn't worth that much at all nyeh.`
` ......Nihi!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` I see, so that is why you reach such an answer, you rabbit who has become cowardly because you have been hurt by love......`
` I have heard that rabbits die of loneliness, but just when was it that your heart was killed...?"`
`"Then, rabbit, I shall alter the question.`
` Why don't I change the second option to, not "the one you love", but "the memories of the one you loved"."`
`"......How is that?`
` Can you still select that one?`
` What's this about the one you love not being worth much at all, foolish rabbit...!"`
`"Filth who cannot even face up to the depths of her own love!!`
` Try and choose it, try and choose to have the one you loved forgotten!!!!!!"`
`"You can, right?`
` I'll bet you can, riiiiiiiight?`
` Cooooome onnnnn, try saying that you caa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaan!!!!"`
`"I, ...I, I can...`
` I can...!!`
` Nihi, .........nihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hiiihii......"`
`"L‐Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}...!`
` Please, have mercy on her......!!"`
`"Hihiiihiii...`
` ......Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinn...!!"`
`"That is enough, rabbit filth!!`
` Go to {f:5:Virgilia} and help keep watch on the dungeon.`
` Begone!!"`
`The Chiester Sisters, their old emotional wounds gouged,`
` disappeared as though running away.`
`After that, even though there was no one left to hear him, Kinzo continued talking as though continuing a play...`
`"......And there you have it, my pleasant test.`
` To be truthful, there is no choice that can be said to be correct."`
`"Whichever answer they choose, it is about whether they can choose...`
`without hesitation,`
` quickly,`
` and with a resolute conviction and their own strong, unshakable will!!"`
`"The reason and their willpower are more important.`
` .........That is what I want to know about.`
` Ahhh, descendants of mine, I am truly looking forward to what kind of answers you will show me!!"`
`"............Hmmmm?`
` Me?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Yes, of course I once had the same question thrust upon me.`
` Because I splendidly answered that devil's question, I was able to claim gold, honor, and that witch herself as my own."`
`"Which answer did I chooooose?`
` .........Do I really need to say it out loud?`
` Wahha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!!"`
`"So.`
` Have you decided on your answer......?"`
`"................................."`
`As Jessica stared at the crushed letter which lay on the floor,`
` ......she hung her head in constant silence.`
`All that filled the room was the sound of the wind and the rain, and the rustling of treetops.`
`{n}Regardless of how noisy that was, it simply made the silence more apparent.`
`Ronove waited for Jessica's answer.`
`{n}......However, Jessica didn't speak.`
`Whether she was deep in thought, or had stopped thinking, Ronove couldn't tell.`
`......No, ...he might actually have known.`
`But, cruelly like a demon, ......Ronove urged Jessica to voice it.`
`".........If you cannot choose any,`
` ......I can at least take your life painlessly, ...if you would like......?"`
`".................................`
` .........ll m."`
`"......What?`
` I'm afraid I had trouble hearing.`
` May I ask you to repeat......?"`
`Jessica lifted her face, ......and looked straight into Ronove's eyes.`
`......It seemed that she had decided on her answer.`
`"............Kill me."`
`Jessica said it one more time, ......clearly.`
`Perhaps Ronove had imagined from the very beginning that this would be the answer.`
`......Without any surprise, he smiled lightly and nodded.`
`"......I thought that you would choose that answer, Jessica‐sama.`
` ......Now then, there is no right or wrong answer to this test.`
` The important part is what thoughts led you to that answer."`
`"Come now.`
` Please answer that with your readiness as the next head."`
`"............It's not like I chose the first one 'cause I wanted to die.`
` ......The second one was letting Kanon‐kun die.`
` That's obviously out of the question.`
` So forget that one.`
` ......The third one was everyone else's lives.`
` That's also obviously out of the question.`
` So forget that one.`
` ......After that, only the first choice remained."`
`"Process of elimination, ......is it.`
` So it was not something you chose proactively, you say......"`
`After chuckling slightly, Ronove dropped his gaze.`
`......A {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} couldn't even imagine what kind of answer a demon would have been hoping for.`
`......All she could understand was that this was apparently slightly below Ronove's expectations.`
`"......It's not a bad answer, but I must say, it's not a good one either.`
` ......I suppose I would call it a 60.`
` ......I'm a little disappointed."`
`"You're a pretty selfish bastard, telling me to answer with self‐confidence and then being disappointed when I do."`
`".........Apparently it was not only process of elimination.`
` ...Either way, it is a failing grade, ......but it seems that there is a little more to your thoughts.`
` Allow me to ask."`
`"I don't want to die.`
` ......So I didn't {i:want} to choose the first one—no one would.`
` ......People struggle as much as life will let them, 'cause they want to live in happiness.`
` So normally, the first choice should be impossible from the beginning."`
`".........However, you took that first choice.`
` You chose to throw away your own life.`
` Only that choice remained."`
`"I tried......thinking of the future that would come after choosing each one."`
`"......Hoh.`
` And what did you find...?"`
`"First, .........I tried letting Kanon‐kun die.`
` .........I tried to imagine the rest of my life after having abandoned the one I love."`
`"What kind of life was it...?"`
`"She was a horrible woman, who didn't deserve to live.`
` A shabby woman who forever lamented her own decision, and lived only to regret.`
` ......A horrible woman who would choose to live and abandon the person she loved... I could never forgive a woman like that.`
` ......I'd put an end to her myself."`
`"Heheh, how spirited.`
` .........In that case, could you not also have considered the third choice?"`
`"......Yeah.`
` I tried letting everyone but me and Kanon‐kun die.`
` ......There's no way Kanon‐kun would like me if I did that."`
`"And it was no good for me either... Although I had Kanon‐kun, all the lives I abandoned for that became a cross that I had to bear for my entire life.`
` ......And even Kanon‐kun was forced to bear that cross."`
`".........I'm not going to make a foolish choice just to force a cross on Kanon‐kun.`
` If there's a future me out there who would do something like that, .........she's unforgivable to me.`
` ...I'd put an end to that woman myself too."`
`Jessica had pictured it in her mind.`
`{n}The future her, beyond each of the three choices.`
`There were three Jessicas.`
`{n}......Of the three, two had regrets.`
`{n}Only one could hold her head high and smile at Kanon.`
`"......You know,`
` I once had the nerve to preach something to Kanon‐kun.`
` ......Something about trying to live life to the fullest."`
`"Live your life to the fullest.`
` ......Meaningful words.`
` That is a surprisingly difficult thing to do."`
`"So yeah.`
` I've got to hold my head high and show Kanon‐kun.`
` .........Show him a way of living where you can hold your head high, and look anyone in the eye with a full and guiltless smile."`
`"......Will Kanon be able to receive your self‐sacrifice?`
` Haven't you considered that your self‐centered decision might hurt him even more...?"`
`"That's why...I want to leave a message..."`
`"Hoh.`
` ......I will listen, but I am after all a demon.`
` ...I may not keep my promises..."`
`".........Keep it.`
` Your promise."`
`Jessica spoke that looking quite unconcerned.`
`She had asked the demon who was about to take her life to pass on a message, and she wasn't thinking for a moment that she would be betrayed.`
`......At that extremely innocent smile, Ronove closed his eyes lightly, and shrugged his shoulders.`
`"Hmph......`
` ......Very well.`
` So?`
` What shall I tell him...?"`
`‘......Tell Kanon‐kun...to live his life to the fullest.`
` ......No, that's not quite it.`
` Not his life...not {i:Kanon‐kun's} life.`
` ......Even now I can't get him to tell me his real name,`
` but tell him to live the real Kanon‐kun's life to the fullest.`
` .........Tell him that.’`
`"...............Mi...lady......"`
`"......Jessica......`
` ......You are unbelievable............"`
`"Ronove is fickle, so he might not have passed the message on.`
` ......Aren't you lucky?`
` To have me here showing you this scene."`
`A musty three‐sided mirror was set beyond the bars, ......and the scene with Jessica was reflected on it.`
`On the next mirror...the scene with George was reflected in the same way.`
`None of them questioned how a three‐sided mirror had appeared from a group of butterflies,`
` or why Jessica and George were reflected on it.`
`......Because the reflected sights themselves were more important.`
`"............You are that prepared...`
`......to throw your life away,`
` ......for his sake........."`
`".................................`
` ......My......deepest apologies..."`
`Krauss looked at Kanon with a complicated expression that had an awkward smile mixed in.`
`{n}......Kanon couldn't meet his eyes.`
`"......{f:5:Virgilia}‐sama.`
` ......There is no reason for Milady to lose her life.`
` ......Please kill me.`
` Please change it to the second choice.`
` ......That way, everything should resolve itself."`
`"Hohhohohohohoho...`
` I am not capable of granting that wish.`
` ......After all, this is Jessica's own decision, which she chose."`
`Suddenly, the air split, and the Chiester Sisters appeared, flying into {f:5:Virgilia}'s chest.`
`"{f:5:Virgilia}‐samaaaaaaaaaaaa!`
` Hiieeehheiiiiih!!"`
`"So mean, so mean, Lord {f:5:Goldsmith} is so meeeeeaan, wahhhn{0}haaaan{0}haahaahhhn!"`
`"I'm......doing the best I can......`
` Crushing me for animal fodder...that's just too much.`
` ......Uuuuuuuughhuhhuu!!"`
`Still without a clue what was going on, {f:5:Virgilia} was smothered by the sobbing Chiester Sisters.`
`"Th‐there, there. Everything's alright, it's alright. Don't cry, don't cry......`
` I'll make you some delicious tea......"`
`"......I'm leaving it up to all of you to guard this place.`
` If they do anything suspicious, inform me immediately...!"`
`The goat attendants all looked at each other, and nodded their heads.`
`{f:5:Virgilia} took the Chiester Sisters and left.`
`The sound of people going up a set of stairs could be heard, so they had probably gone to an upper floor.`
`".........This is our chance.`
` ......These goat‐heads seem to be stupid.`
` ......I wonder if we can trick them..."`
`Kyrie realized that an opportunity had arrived, but she still hadn't thought of a way to break the metal bars......`
`The Jessica reflected on the three‐sided mirror closed her eyes, as though she had given up.`
`......The way she had both hands stuck into her pockets, wanting to be defiant until the very end, might have been her own kind of aesthetics.`
`"............That's all I want to say.`
` .........Kill me."`
`"......Very well.`
` ............Here we go, then.`
` ......Do not worry, for I shall make your death more gentle and merciful than any sleep."`
`Ronove raised his palm......as he slowly approached Jessica......`
`"Dammiiiiiiiiiiittt!!`
` Wrooggh!!`
` Graaah!!"`
`Realizing that his daughter would be killed, Krauss repeatedly body‐slammed the metal bars, going half‐mad.`
`The goats looked like they were sneering at how a mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} didn't stand a chance at breaking those bars.`
`And, true, Krauss's pointless effort might have been comical.`
`......But Krauss was giving it everything he had.`
` As Jessica's father, he was living in that moment with everything he had, so that he could save her.`
`.........Kanon made tight fists with both hands.`
`If he used his cursed power, he might be able to cut through even metal bars.`
`......But there were a full three goats.`
` ...There was no way he could defeat three of them in an instant.`
` It would instantly be reported, and then {f:5:Virgilia} and even the Chiester Sisters would dash in.`
`Though he may be able to break the bars, ......he could do nothing more.`
`{n}......It was useless.`
`......Kanon knew already that the witch was sneering at that kind of useless effort,`
` ......so he could do nothing but stare at Krauss's repeated body‐slams...`
`"......Ah, ............George‐sama......"`
`Shannon, who had been looking at the three‐sided mirror, let out a voice.`
`...They looked to see that George, who had been silent this whole time, had raised his head.`
`{n}......It seemed that George had also decided on an answer...`
`"............Have you decided?`
` Your answer?"`
`"Yeah.`
` .........I've decided."`
`"Is that an unwavering answer...?"`
`"Yeah. It's unwavering."`
`"Then let's hear it.`
` .........Oh, by the way,`
` it seems Jessica decided to take the "your life" option.`
` I hope that an indecisive person like you won't simply say you chose the same answer......?"`
`"......Jessica gave her own answer.`
` ......No matter which choice that was, it was Jessica's answer.`
` It does not influence my answer in any way."`
`"I see.`
` Then let me ask again.`
` ............Among the three mentioned below.`
` In order to gain two, sacrifice one."`
`"1. Your life.`
` {nobr:2. Shannon's} life.`
` {nobr:3. Everyone} else's lives.`
` .........Which have you chosen?`
` Could it be the first one, like Jessica?"`
`".........No."`
`"Oh......?"`
`Gaap looked a little surprised.`
` ......Because she had thought that a timid‐looking man like this would never choose any other option.`
`".....................`
` ......That's nice to hear.`
` I'm glad the most boring option for me has been removed.`
` ......Then, it seems unlikely, but......is it the second?`
` Can you abandon Shannon's life......?"`
`".........You must be joking.`
` Why would I do that to the person I'm going to give an engagement ring to tonight?"`
`"........................`
` .........Now this is bold.`
` Is that your answer......?"`
`".........Yes.`
` ......My answer...`
`...is the third choice."`
`George had chosen.........the third choice.`
`{n}......“Everyone else's lives”.`
`Even Gaap hadn't been able to imagine that answer.`
`......She had been sure that he'd choose number one, just like Jessica......`
`{n}So, she became interested in how he had reached that answer.`
`......How he had reached an answer that had defied the imagination of the 33rd ranked demon of the 72.`
`"I want you to tell me.`
` .........Tell me the perspective that makes you able to sacrifice the lives of everyone else so that you and the fiancée you love will be safe.`
` ......Process of elimination, like Jessica?"`
`"No.`
` This is the clear and only choice for me."`
`"...............So it's "I'm alright, Jack"?`
` You can sacrifice the world for the woman you love...?"`
`"Just what are you talking about?"`
`"............What.........?"`
`George faced the demon as he spoke, looking at her almost in disbelief.`
`"......Tonight,`
` I planned on calling Shannon to this very spot, and giving her this ring as proof of our engagement."`
`".........There probably are quite a few people who wouldn't celebrate an engagement between me and Shannon.`
` I was prepared to make enemies of the entire family by announcing my engagement to her."`
`"I have been prepared.`
` Since the time I came to this island, .........no, that's not it.`
` .........Since the time I confessed to her that I wanted us to get engaged."`
`"............So, you can sacrifice everything else as long as you can get married......?"`
`"Marriage...`
`...means remaining an ally to your wife for your entire life.`
` .........As of that moment,`
` ......I was prepared to make the entire world my enemy for her sake."`
`Those words, through the three‐sided mirror, ......also reached Shannon's ears.`
`{n}And his determination reached her eyes.`
`......Shannon certainly had arranged with George that tonight, she would be given an engagement ring.`
`Then this incident had occurred, and she hadn't been able to receive the ring.`
`But now,`
` .........even though it wasn't in the form of a ring,`
` ......Shannon had received something even greater.`
`......And as proof of that,`
` ......a single tear with the same sparkle as a diamond...`
`dripped down.`
`"Heh, ......heheheheheheh......!`
` What a gutsy answer.`
` .........Yes, if I really think about it, this was an easy decision for you."`
`"After all, your parents were already killed on the first twilight, right?`
` By now, there's no one whose death would bother you.`
` Hahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha, I see, this was an easy choice.`
` Ahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha......"`
`"You can say whatever you want.`
` This is my determination and my choice, ......personally, and as the next family head."`
`The sparkle in George's eyes was brilliant and sharp.`
`...For just an instant, Gaap felt the same sense of intimidation that Kinzo exuded, and was slightly overpowered.`
`".........I see.`
` ......So, the same answer as {f:5:Goldsmith}......`
` ......Despite your innocent face, ......you're going to become a terrible demon in the future.`
` ......What do you know, we might get along pretty well."`
`"You will succeed {f:5:Goldsmith}.`
` And maybe one day, I may even be summoned eventually and serve you.`
` ......That might be surprisingly interesting.`
` .........Heheh."`
`Gaap needed to change her opinion of George.`
`......This man bore a determination and resolve unimaginable from his outward appearance, and had not adopted that just now,`
` ......but had possessed it since the very beginning.`
`"I am prepared to inherit the headship right away.`
` .........No, that's not it.`
` You told me to think as the head in this test.`
` So I answered based on the premise that I am the head."`
`".........No, even that's not it.`
` I thought as the head himself.`
` ......Right now...I {i:am} the head of the Ushiromiya family."`
`".......................................`
` Ehheheheheh......`
` I'm impressed... I didn't expect you to be able to say so much."`
`"It seems you really are one to be reckoned with.`
` ......Battler's and Maria's tests haven't been done yet, but if you ask me, I think you should be the one to pass.`
` ............But only if that is your true, unexaggerated answer, of course?"`
`"............Do you doubt my resolve?"`
`"Can you carry out the choice you chose?`
` Can you, right now, with your own hands, offer all the lives that exist on this island as sacrifices......?`
` With your own hands, I remind you...?"`
`"I can.`
` I've said several times that I have that resolve."`
`"Ha, ............hahahahahaha!`
` Then return to the guesthouse right away, and kill Battler and Maria!`
` When that is done, I will bring you the other hostages.`
` Execute each of them except Shannon before her eyes!`
` You can do it, right?!"`
`"{i:I can}.`
` My resolve is on a whole different level from yours."`
`"...........................mngh.`
` Then carry it out!`
` Death for them all!`
` Carry out this blood‐stained ritual as the new head of the Ushiromiya family...!!"`
`"......Understood.`
` I'll carry it out.`
` I am already the head of the Ushiromiya family."`
`"Yes, that's right!`
` Stain that throne red by your own hands...!`
` You will become king of the netherworld, ruler of all demons...!!"`
`Gaap was now sure.`
`{n}This man was truly fitting to succeed Kinzo's madness...!`
`"Rage on, storm! Cry out, thunder!!`
` Celebrate the birth of the new demon king!!`
` The island of demons has now welcomed a new ruler...!!"`
`In response to the demon's call, the tempest raged more and more.`
`Then a massive lightning bolt fell, its tearing thunder and brilliant light creating the feeling of just a moment of silence......`
`"So,`
` ............about the order of the murders.`
` I get to choose, right?"`
`"Please, as you wish, Your Majesty, the new demon king of Rokkenjima.`
` As your heart desires...!"`
`".........Well, for lack of a better option...`
`the first one will be you, then—I hope that won't be a problem?"`
`"..............................Huh?"`
`A gust of wind blew, ......stirring up George's jacket as though it was a cloak.`
`It was very much like the cloak worn by the head.`
`{n}It definitely gave the same impression of grandeur......`
`......At that time, ......Gaap certainly saw the storm wiped away, and the sky covered with a pure‐white and vast full moon.`
`Bearing the full moon on his back,`
` the man who called himself the new head...`
`sneered at the demon.`
`"Even the lives of the Ushiromiya family, all of them......are now my fortune.`
` There will be reparations to be made for the damage that has been done to that fortune.`
` It won't be cheap."`
`"......You didn't seriously think you could take the lives of my parents, Aunt Natsuhi, Uncle Rudolf, Auntie Rosa,`
` and Genji‐san, and hope I'd overlook it, right?"`
`"Ho...`
`......hohoh...`
`............you little wise guy......"`
`Ronove had been intending to press his palm against Jessica's chest and stop her heart.`
`But a short distance away, his hand had stopped......`
`......On the carpet at their feet,`
` ......plop, plop...small red flowers bloomed one after another.`
`The seeds of those flowers...`
`...had fallen down from high, high above,`
` .........all the way from Jessica's fist,`
` ...held up as though to strike the heavens.`
`Ronove's nose was stained red with spurting blood,`
` ......and those drops were dripping onto the carpet.`
`".........By the way, that just now was my answer as a maiden.`
` ......My answer as the next head is different."`
`"Allow me to ask......"`
`"......The person I love, my family and my relatives, everyone, everyone!!`
` I'll protect them.`
` If I'm the head, then that's my duty!"`
`"Dad wasn't just acting self‐important.`
` He was protecting me and Mom!!`
` ......Fighting the pressure of succeeding the Ushiromiya family......for several decades!!"`
`"So I know.`
` ......Being the successor is nothing trivial.`
` ......So you know what?`
` This is easy as hell.`
` ......It's easy as hell for me to risk my own life!!"`
`Jessica knew.`
`She knew that her father, in order to protect his family, was even now bluffing and fighting a solitary fight.`
`Jessica understood something that his back had been telling her!`
`Another left straight was buried into Ronove's face.`
`{n}......That mighty strike wasn't due just to the brass knuckles she was using.`
`It was a strike...`
`of a person, a family head, who could throw away everything in order to protect.`
`"If Dad's lost his qualifications to be the successor,`
` then I, the next in line, will succeed the headship.`
` ......Head of the Ushiromiya family, Ushiromiya Jessica!!`
` I'm not enough of a wimp to let you keep on doing whatever the fuck you want!!"`
`"............A wonderful answer.`
` I shall change your score from earlier.`
` Plus 10 for that answer.`
` ......Plus 10 for that splendid left straight."`
`"Which means I only need plus 20 more for a perfect 100?"`
`Ronove backflipped away from her, and violently wiped away the blood pouring from his nose.`
`......It had become, not blood, but petals of a red rose.`
`The blood on his face was wiped off, ......and in its place...`
`was a grin from a great delight, which he had last felt so many centuries ago that he could no longer remember just how long it had been.`
`"Your resolve.`
` I, Ronove, will test to see whether it is deserving of full marks......"`
`"Cram it, jackass!!`
` Come at meeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"`
`"Come, to the Abyss...!"`
`"Wwagh?!"`
`Beneath George's feet, a pitch‐black pit suddenly opened its mouth wide.`
`{n}Of course, George had no way of resisting.`
`After being swallowed up by it, George fell out of a pitch‐black hole that had opened up in the ceiling of the arbor.`
`As George fell down,`
` he was hit sharply in the gut, like a precision bee‐strike, by a reverse roundhouse kick from a stiletto heel...!`
`Launched out of the arbor, the instant George thought that he was about to be swallowed up by a rose bush...`
`...another pitch‐black hole opened there and swallowed George up.`
`And this time, a pitch‐black hole opened in front of Gaap at her feet, spitting a defenseless George out of it.`
`......By that time, Gaap had already finished the preparatory motions for the next reverse roundhouse kick.`
`"Ghh, ......what is......this..."`
`"Welcome back. *giggle*!"`
`Right side of the head.`
` Below the right armpit.`
` Side of the right knee.`
`As Gaap danced and spun like a small cyclone,`
` she kept hitting him, {nobr:right foot} {nobr:left foot} {nobr:right foot} {nobr:left foot}, with successive roundhouse kicks.`
`The fourth one became a sweep, cutting George's feet out from under him and making him fall down,`
` but of course, there was no floor there, but a pitch‐black hole, and George was swallowed up once again.`
`Gaap once again spun around like a small cyclone.`
`{n}George, likewise, was once again spat out from the ceiling of the arbor.`
`".........Take this and keep it as a memento, the single strike at the end of the Abyss.`
` ......Die......!!"`
`The sharp strike of the queen bee pierced the heavens like a rising cyclone.`
`{n}It kicked through George's abdomen as he fell from the ceiling......`
`And then, ......time froze.`
` George was pinned in midair by Gaap's raised leg......`
`"Gah, .........mmph........."`
`Still pinned in midair, George moaned......`
`Then Gaap, with George still hung up on her foot,`
` ......grinned.`
`".........I'll admit it.`
` Your attitude at least is mature.`
` But that's no good if it doesn't come along with power."`
`"......Did you know?`
` They say you need three kinds of power to rule this world.`
` The first is influence.`
` The second is wealth.`
` Do you know what the last one is?"`
`"I read it in a book.`
` ......Force, right......?"`
`"Correct.`
` That is what you are lacking."`
`Gaap finally released George.`
`By kicking him upwards one more time, adding in another roundhouse kick and smashing him into a pillar.`
`"Ghh? ......Ung...uhhhgh......!"`
`"No one will fear a monarch without influence, without wealth, or without force."`
`"Kinzo possessed all three.`
` That is why he reigned as a tyrant!`
` ......If you're going to call yourself Kinzo's successor, try showing me some of his majesty!"`
`"......Come on, how long are you going to lie there?`
` Stand up.`
` If you don't, you'll {i:fall} again, see?"`
`"Pu ku ku ku.`
` Not bad movements.`
` But I feel they are somewhat unsuitable for a lady."`
`"Asshooooooooole!!`
` Ducking and weaving and hopping around!!`
` Aren't you gonna fight back......?! Quit jerking me around, you douche!!"`
`Ronove was dodging skillfully, jumping back, and avoiding Jessica's fists,`
` but he still wasn't striking back himself.`
`Because of his agile movements, as swift as a flag whipping around in strong winds, Jessica's fist wasn't even able to touch him.`
`Amidst a feeling of her blood running hot, Jessica regained her offensive composure.`
`Even though this room was large for a bedroom, it was too small an area to keep up such exaggerated dodges for long.`
`......She calmly realized that, and started using not just her fists, but her legs as well.`
`"......Hoh.`
` ......Doing boxing with just your arms makes you but half a man.`
` Your arms must be the roaring lion, burning with power.`
` And your legs the snake, cold as ice as it closes in on its prey."`
`"Snakes don't have legs!"`
`"Pu ku ku, very true."`
`Jessica began cornering Ronove towards the wall with perfect footwork.`
` She wouldn't let him get around her.`
`......Ronove's magnificent dodges looked flashy, but they needed sufficient room.`
`Once cornered, he wouldn't be able to dodge anymore...!`
`Jessica had a good understanding of the special characteristics of her equipped weapon, the brass knuckles.`
`This powerful weapon's most notable characteristic was how it didn't let the opponent defend.`
`Even if they blocked with their arm, that arm would receive direct damage.`
`{n}......If it hit the wrong way, it might even break the bone.`
`So she pressed him forward.`
` She would block off his escape routes, ......and then, with this fist, she would chip this demon down!!`
`"Whoops...!`
` Oh my, when did...?"`
`"Looks like I've finally cornered you, huh......?`
` Where is everyone being held?`
` Where's that old bastard hiding?`
` You tell me everything, and I'll let you go with nothing more than ripping that mustache off, alright?"`
`"That would be a problem.`
` Believe it or not, it does take me an hour every morning to set this, you see."`
`"If I put you in a plaster cast, I guess you won't even be able to do that!"`
`"............Oops‐a‐daisy.`
` .....................gggh."`
`Ronove had blocked Jessica's lunged fist with his arm.`
`{n}He tried to act as though it was no big deal, but it must have hurt a lot.`
`......Jessica grinned.`
`{n}Ronove smiled the same way, but twitched slightly.`
`"......I see.`
` This certainly does hurt."`
`"Final warning.`
` Break down and apologize."`
`"That, I cannot do.`
` It would ruin my image."`
`"Then just break.`
` Flurry of puncheeeeeeeees!!!"`
`Jessica's iron fists were pounded into Ronove.`
`But Jessica was startled—the impact felt wrong, and there was the sound of breaking glass.`
`"Wh‐......?!"`
`At a glance, it looked like Ronove had caught Jessica's fist with his palm.`
` ......That wasn't quite true.`
`When Ronove opened his hand, a faint purple glowing barrier like a glass shield appeared there,`
` stopping the attack by a hair's breadth.`
`Pulling herself together, Jessica struck out with her fists again, but with truly magnificent movements, Ronove caught all of them......`
`"I am, after all, a demon.`
` I am at least capable of this level of magic.`
` .........I must say, though, you are quite good.`
` If I were a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, I am sure that this is where I would have admitted defeat.`
` It is because I am a demon that I can still continue to fight."`
`"Y‐......you frigging cheater.........!"`
`"Is that all?`
` ......Are you sure that by attacking all the time, you are not neglecting your own defense?"`
`"Huh?!"`
`"......Waaah!!"`
`Ronove pounded his palm into Jessica's stomach, stopping abruptly just a fraction away.`
`Jessica was repelled by the purple shield, tumbled backwards, and smashed her head on the bed.`
`"My shield cannot be broken by a mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` I suggest that you never again dream of being able to touch my body."`
`"......In that case, ......I'll just punch straight through that shield......!!"`
`"You are a dauntless person.`
` That tenacity...yes, it is truly fitting for the next family head.`
` ......Why don't I be your opponent for just a while longer.`
` This is one of the privileges of an examiner.`
` .........Pukku{0}ku{0}ku{0}ku{0}kuku!"`
`"SHATTER TO PIECEEEEEEEES, IIIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!"`
`Gaap looked down on George, sneering.`
`{n}He was lying face‐down in a puddle on the rose garden path.`
`The merciless rain beat down on him, so that it looked as though even the heavens were mocking him...`
`".........Ahhahahahahahaha.`
` Stand up.`
` You'll fall again."`
`"..........................."`
`George stood up shakily.`
`......It seemed his spirit hadn't given in, but the damage to his body was fairly significant.`
`"Beg for your life.`
` What you're doing now is the same as the fourth choice of choosing nothing.`
` ......You chose the third choice, right?`
` If you get down on your hands and knees and apologize, I'll forgive your rudeness towards me."`
`"Then, I'll guide you down to the dungeon.`
` There, for your beloved Shannon and your own powerless self, you will kill the other hostages one by one."`
`"......You can do it, right?`
` You did boast about having that resolve.`
` ......Heheheheheh."`
`George didn't answer.`
`{n}......But his gaze was still obstinately resisting surrender.`
`"......If you are too obstinate, then this time you really will fall to the deepest depths of the Abyss...`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`Gaap's strength was undeniable.`
`......There was no doubt that Shannon's group, watching through the three‐sided mirror, understood that—`
`probably even more clearly than George himself...`
`".........George‐sama......`
` ......Please,`
` ......that's enough.........`
` ...You don't have to do this for someone like me......"`
`"Nee‐san......"`
`"......If you didn't fall in love with me,`
` ......you wouldn't have to fight with anyone, right, George‐sama...?`
` Then please, just abandon me......`
` Please, forget me......"`
`There was no way for that voice to reach George.`
`......But, even so,`
` ......George answered.`
`"No way.`
` ............I won't...surrender."`
`"......Oh?`
` Why......?"`
`"............Because that...is my...resolve.`
` ......I'll fight everything for Shannon's sake.`
` And I'll make everything accept us,`
` ......and everything bless us."`
`"Hey, tell me something.`
` How can you go so far for that furniture called Shannon?`
` .........She's just a good‐for‐nothing, isn't she?`
` Furniture for the garbage that doesn't even make for a satisfactory waitress."`
`"............I won't permit any more insults against the woman I love."`
`"So what are you going to do about it?`
` How is a weak kiddo like you going to fight against me...?"`
`"Loving someone is strength.`
` ......I was able to become strong because I learned that feeling.`
` .........‘Shannon,`
` I love you.’`
` With just those words, I can stand back up, over and over again."`
`"Shannon's in the dungeon, you know?`
` No good professing your love to me."`
`"No.`
` She heard.`
` ......Because that is love.`
` Shannon can hear my words right now.`
` The reason I can believe that...is because of love."`
`"..................This guy... ......"`
`‘Shannon.`
` You are not furniture.`
` ......Even if you were, you would be mine alone, the only furniture for me in the world.`
` I want you to be close to me all my life.`
` ......I need you...always and forever.’`
`".........G‐......George‐sama..............."`
`"......I'm jealous.`
` He's surpassed my husband in smooth talking."`
`"Th‐......this is youth."`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` Love is strength?`
` Then why are you so weak, boy?`
` It must mean your love is also that weak, then, I guess?"`
`"*snicker*snicker*!`
` Your love for your fiancée is weak.`
` Your parents' disappointingly quick deaths were weak.`
` Everything about your life is weak."`
`"...............Shannon taught me about love and strength.`
` If you insist upon measuring my love for Shannon by my strength alone,`
` ......then let me teach you about my love."`
`"*chuckle*, nice words.`
` ......Nowww I get it.`
` So you say that the way you can still stand up after being kicked down so many times is the strength you received from Shannon.`
` In that case, what did you receive from your mother and father, who were killed without a fight?`
` .........?"`
`Suddenly, there was a blackout.`
` ......Outside?`
`".........N‐......no.`
` .........Th‐...this is............"`
`The thing blocking Gaap's vision...`
`............was the bottom...`
`of George's...`
`...`
`shoe...`
`"............Side kick.`
` Nasal bone fractured."`
`It had stopped right in front of the tip of Gaap's nose.`
`"The thing I got from Mother was this kick."`
`After several moments' delay, Gaap jumped back.`
` Of course, it was too late.`
`If George hadn't stopped, he probably would have caused exactly the damage he had announced.`
`"And what I got from Father...`
`...is patience."`
`Anger with a low boiling point isn't something to be truly feared.`
`{n}......True anger is cultivated through patience.`
`".........I understand your declaration of violent intent.`
` ......I also understand your defamation of my fiancée and my parents.`
` And you have no intention of retracting any of these......?"`
`"......Y‐you......"`
`"I have a sufficient understanding of your attacks now.`
` ............If you're ready...may I fight back?"`
`"E‐enough of your slick talk, bucko......!!"`
`A pitch‐black hole opened its mouth at George's feet.`
`But George rapidly opened his legs, straddling the hole.`
` The same move wouldn't work again...!`
`It was an extremely light dodge, and the upper part of his body didn't even quiver.`
`"Patience means not losing your cool, and instead composedly researching your opponent's moves.`
` .........For what purpose?`
` Isn't it obvious?`
` Do you know?"`
`"N‐n‐no I don't......"`
`"It's to counter, to give back exactly what you got, to make them never want to mess with you again,`
` to make them cover their face in tears and snot and forget to wipe it off,`
` to make them want to rub their forehead on the ground and apologize over and over—to completely, perfectly, thoroughly...!!!`
` ......Pulverize them until they can't get up."`
`George dashed.`
`Pits opened one after another, but George would not step in them again.`
`And because she persisted in that move, Gaap was captured for a second time...`
`".........Reverse roundhouse.`
` Jaw fractured."`
`"...............!"`
`It was stretched out more forcefully and beautifully than Gaap's had been.`
`Of course, while it centered directly on Gaap's face, it stopped a hair's breadth away.`
`Perhaps she couldn't rely on pitfalls at this close range.`
`Gaap kicked at George's shins as a diversion,`
` and in the instant of weakness when he tried to deal with that, she aimed a kick at his stomach.`
`It was a bee‐like stab by her stiletto heel.`
`......But it sliced through the air where George was no longer.`
`".........High axe kick.`
` Collarbone fractured."`
`"............wh‐uh—"`
`From beside Gaap,`
` George coldly announced that, his foot still raised.`
`If that monarch's heel had been swung down, a collarbone fracture would have been an understatement.`
`"This guy's...`
`......stronger than me...at close range......?!`
` Need distance......"`
`She jumped backwards to gain a large distance.`
`She jumped and jumped and leapt and even backflipped, increasing the distance between them.`
`It should have been magnificent, but for some reason, it looked very similar to the movements of a small, scared animal.`
`If she opened the distance, she could fight at the range that was her specialty, using a mixture of pitfalls and kicking techniques...!`
`"You fool... Regret the arrogance of passing on three chances to defeat me, in the depths of the Abyss!!`
` ..................Huh?"`
`Gaap landed beautifully and tried to aim a pitfall,`
` when a razor‐sharp wind cut her bangs.`
` ...Yes, cut them.`
`And twice.`
` ......This time it didn't just stop a hair's breadth away, but scattered her bangs with its air pressure......`
`".........Armada com martelo.`
` ......Orbital blowout fracture with the first strike.`
` Cerebral contusion with the second strike."`
`"..................{m:-5:——}—...!!!"`
`Gaap was too shocked to speak.`
`George had closed all that distance in an instant, and let off a fearsomely nimble midair double kick.`
`......Furthermore, with the accuracy and edge of a razor, it had cut nothing more than a few of her bangs.`
`"I learned the power of kicks from karate,`
` speed from tae kwon do,`
` and freedom of range from capoeira."`
`"......Mother was always trying something new.`
` But it was very educational being able to study their various merits."`
`"Wh‐......why don't you hit......?`
` ......Because I'm a woman?!!"`
`"......You spoke of force as a monarch's third power."`
`"It looks like you're still mistaking the meaning of that force.`
` ......In this situation, force doesn't mean hastily wielded violence.`
` .........It refers to a deterrent—the knowledge that if someone opposes the monarch, that person won't get away unharmed."`
`"A deterrent......?"`
`That was the point.`
` That was why all of George's attacks up until then had stopped just before the blow.`
`These bare misses, which were more difficult than hitting directly, had all been performed so splendidly.`
`...And any one of them would probably have crushed Gaap in a single hit, if George had wished it.`
`He was—deliberately—not doing that.`
`"You said it yourself, right?`
` Force is the power to rule.`
` .........If you destroy your opponent with force, you won't be able to rule them, right?"`
`"A monarch's force is something that is only shown.`
` He does not destroy.`
` ......He makes others submit, and adds them to his own fortune.`
` If you black out on me, I won't be able to make you guide me to where everyone is being held."`
`Gaap had to admit it.`
`She had to admit that George understood force in the truest sense...!`
`"You'll take me to where everyone is.`
` I would advise against resisting.`
` .........I won't hold back anymore."`
`"...khh...!!`
` .........Sorry, Lia... Lemme borrow your troops.`
` This guy's too much for me alone to handle!!"`
`As a large, pitch‐black hole opened in the sky,`
` thunk, thunk, thunk—three muscular goat attendants fell out.`
` They surrounded George.`
`".........Reinforcements?`
` I wonder if I should take this to mean that you retract your statement about me being weak."`
`"I, ......I admit it.`
` ......I made light of your power...the power of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s......"`
`"No.`
` This is the strength of a man who has come to know love."`
`"Wh‐what tripe... How can you say stuff like that with a straight face?!!`
` Come, goats!`
` Crush this man into meatballs!"`
`"Heheheh, these goats are stupid, but it looks like they at least have power.`
` I'll make it so that even your fiancée won't be able to recognize your corpse!"`
`"You refuse to surrender and intend to continue fighting. Understood.`
` ......I proclaim that henceforth, you will receive real harm proportional to your own attacks."`
`"If you still plan on attacking me, I suggest you prepare to receive a great deal of damage."`
`When George proclaimed that,`
` ......a faint red magic circle rose up around him.`
`But it seemed that George couldn't see it.`
`{n}However, Gaap, being a demon, could.`
`"M‐......magic?!`
` Why does this guy have a defensive barrier...?!`
` And what's more, it's......specialized for counterattacks...?!`
` Is this......wh‐what you meant by a deterrent......?!"`
`From a demon's perspective, that might have been magic.`
`But in George's eyes, it was...determination.`
`It was absolute determination that would show no mercy to anyone who wished for further fighting,`
` and force them to prepare for a significant counterattack.`
` Absolute determination...becomes magic.`
`Ronove had been accurately blocking Jessica's fists with the shield.`
` ......But something felt odd.`
`Even though he was certainly stopping the blows with the shield,`
` he felt his arm beginning to strain and ache.`
`All physical damage should have been shut off.`
`......However, the damage from her fists was gradually being transmitted to his arm, and was accumulating.`
`Ronove acted like he was composed, so that this wouldn't be noticed...`
`"Heh, heheh...!!`
` I'm not gonna get worn out.`
` What's wrong, old man?`
` Starting to get a little tough...?!"`
`"......No matter how much you attack, it is useless.`
` Why can't you understand that you cannot break my shield?"`
`"Saying that is not gonna stop me hitting you.`
` ......No matter how hard someone's heart is, words are gonna get through to them a little bit each time, and eventually, you can make a crack...!`
` I believe it!!`
` I believe that there's no such thing as useless effort in this world!!"`
`"Isn't that why we live?! To the fullest!!`
` If words get through eventually, then the same goes for fists...!!`
` I don't even know the meaning of the words "give up"!!"`
`Those words were probably aimed at Kanon...`
` Kanon had, technically, rejected Jessica's words.`
` ......But Jessica knew that, no matter how obstinate his heart was, those words would eventually soak through.`
`And she believed that surely, the day would come when he would understand her heart, and stop calling himself furniture and disparaging himself,`
` ......and step out into his new life.`
`So Jessica wouldn't give up.`
` She wouldn't lose heart...!`
`"Sounds dumb as hell, huh?`
` I'll bet it makes no sense to a guy like you, does it?`
` See, a girl in love...doesn't even think about "giving up because it's useless"!!"`
`At that time, Ronove certainly saw.`
`{n}He saw the red‐hot burning glow of light surround Jessica's fists.`
`".........This is......problematic.`
` ......Enchanted, are they?`
` ...Permeation upgrade......that will be troublesome."`
`Within her relentless fists and determination...dwelled the power to succeed no matter what.`
`{n}From a demon's perspective, that was magic.`
` Absolute determination...becomes magic.`
`"See?`
` Nothing useless about it.`
` ...My fists are making it through, aren't they?`
` You're guarding your arm, old man."`
`"...............It seems I will have to get a little more serious.`
` ...It appears it is as you said.`
` ......In this world, nothing is useless."`
`"That's right...!`
` If you give up saying something's useless, that's when your life is frigging over...!`
` I'll get through to him.`
` ......Definitely...!!"`
`I'm an idiot, so this is the only way I can live,`
` but even so, ......I believe that one day,`
` I'll definitely be able to teach Kanon‐kun about a new world!!`
`So I'm not gonna buckle in a place like this...!!`
`{n}I'll definitely defeat you,`
` and save everyone!!`
`"Dammit!!`
` If I could just...open a hole......aaaaaaaargghhh!!!"`
`Krauss was repeating his useless effort in trying to somehow open a hole between the metal bars.`
`......Useless.`
` .........There's nothing useless.`
`{n}There's nothing...`
`The lookout goats had been swallowed up by those black pits and disappeared.`
`......Now was their do‐or‐die chance.`
`This was their only chance to break the bars......`
`"S‐stop it, it's impossible, Krauss‐san!`
` We can't do anything about them with our bare hands!`
` Let's look for a tool, don't waste time on the impossible...!"`
`"If you give up saying it's useless, then it's all over...that's what my daughter said.`
` ......Even if it's impossible for my body, as long as a small person like Shannon or Kanon could make it through......!!"`
`"......At this stage, action is more important than racking our brains.`
` Let's put our strength together, I'll join in too...!`
` ......Kanon‐kun, you're a boy, lend a hand...!`
` ......Kanon‐kun?!"`
`"............Krauss‐sama.`
` Please stand back."`
`"What?`
` What are you thinking of......?"`
`"......It's alright, isn't it, Nee‐san?`
` .........If we try struggling...just one more time."`
`"............Yeah.`
` ......I'll...struggle once more as well.`
` ......No, not once.`
` ...Over and over again."`
`Jessica's voice had reached Kanon.`
`{n}It had certainly permeated into his stone‐cold heart.`
`And George's voice had reached Shannon.`
` If the love he had shown was embodied by strength, she would have to respond in the same way.`
`An incredible metallic sound rang out.`
`.........The first flash cut horizontally through several of the metal bars, and with the next flash, they were cut through horizontally again,`
` causing them to clatter to the ground like bamboo shoots cut by a sword.`
`Krauss, Kyrie, and Nanjo didn't even have a clue about what had just happened......`
`"......Doctor Nanjo.`
` Which way down the corridor goes to the mansion......?"`
`"Y‐.........yes!`
` It's to the left at the back...to the left at the back......!"`
`"Let's go, everyone.`
` ......We'll be noticed by {f:5:Virgilia}‐sama any time now."`
`"You two...`
`......what in the world {i:are} you......?"`
`"............We're......"`
`When Kanon hung his head a little and faltered, Shannon slapped his shoulder, smiled, and spoke.`
`"We are {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}."`
`"V‐{f:5:Virgilia}‐sama!!`
` Response from warning network, jailbreak!`
` The goat guards aren't there for some reason...!!"`
`"......Whaaat?! Why?!`
` ...............It's Gaap, isn't it.`
` Taking my summons without asking!!`
` ......Gap!`
` Gapgap!!"`
`"......Confirming Rules of Engagement.`
` Request permission to fire at the escapees, ma'am."`
`"Do it...!`
` Kill them! {ruby:Grrrr:Kiiiiii}!!`
` Gapgapgap,`
` gab,`
` gya!!!"`
`"Understood, ma'am.`
` 45, 410, preparing for sniping pursuit combat.`
` Ammo type: Guided cluster rounds.`
` ......{f:5:Virgilia}‐sama, the escape prevention barrier."`
`"Owowowow......`
` Y‐yes, right.`
` Hohhoho, I won't let you escape from here.`
` ......Owow, bit my tongue saying Gapgap..."`
`As they ran down the underground passage, the path in front of them was once again blocked by metal bars.`
` The door was, of course, locked.`
`......However, that was no problem for them now.`
`"Kanon, more metal bars!`
` We need you...!"`
`"Yes, Krauss‐sama...!"`
`"......That is incredible, though.`
` ...I wonder if you could tell me what kind of principle it works on."`
`"I'm not interested in principles.`
` The only thing that's important is that he can sever the metal bars, and we can escape from here...!`
` Don't get distracted, Kanon, just do it!"`
`"Leave it to me......!"`
`Kanon sliced the metal bars again with a red trail.`
` But there was a harsh, strange noise, and only a slight scratch was left on the metal bars.`
`"G‐goodness,`
` ......these are sturdy......"`
`"No.`
` ......It's enchanted!`
` It's {f:5:Virgilia}‐sama's magic lock."`
`"Can you cut through it?"`
`"Of course.`
` But it will take time."`
`"I'll give you three minutes...!"`
`After taking a deep breath and focusing his concentration, Kanon once again extended his sword that trailed red.`
`When he pressed it hard against the metal bars, sparks sprayed, almost as though he was burning through them with a blowtorch.`
`"It looks like cutting it is possible, ......but it's going to make us work for it."`
`".........Krauss‐sama.`
` We've been locked on to by the enemy.`
` Please move back."`
`"Huh?`
` Pursuers?`
` There's no one coming!"`
`"Please get behind me.`
` They're aiming for us...!!"`
`"45, data received.`
` Targets acquired. Correcting for terrain.`
` Forming firing curve, control points adjusted.`
` Data link to 410."`
`"410, data received.`
` Checking danger zone, no problems."`
`"00, loading 48 sub‐rounds, individual homing F&F.`
` Guided cluster rounds: ready."`
`"45, firing preparations complete.`
` Guided cluster rounds: loaded."`
`"410, nihhihihihi!`
` Firiiing!!"`
`A golden arrow that sparkled gold was fired, leaving a gold tail streaming behind.`
`{n}It drew a curve, went through the door, through the keyhole, down the stairs, towards the underground path at full speed......!`
`"S‐something shone!!"`
`"......You can't block the golden arrow with a shield.`
` Kanon‐kun, prepare to intercept.`
` Let's link."`
`"Gatekeeper, understood.`
` .........It's been a long time since I've fought alongside you, Nee‐san.`
` Don't screw up."`
`"Yeah.`
` I'll give it everything I've got."`
`"Then we'll be fine!"`
`Kanon stopped cutting the bars, and stood in front of Shannon.`
`Behind him, Shannon closed her eyes, concentrating her mind, focusing deep, deep into the darkness of the underground path......`
`A guided cluster round is a special kind of arrow made up of 48 sub‐rounds bound together.`
`{n}It explodes mid‐flight and divides into 48 mini‐arrows.`
`The strength of each individual one is low, but they pierce through all shields and possess total lethality against ground troops.`
`And on top of that, each one of the 48 possesses autonomous guidance towards their individual targets.`
`".........It shone.`
` ...It's divided..."`
`"Checking guided cluster round division.`
` 46...7...8, ...48 sub‐rounds, all locks acquired.`
` Interception control. Data link to Kanon."`
`"Kanon, data received.`
` ......Your ability is incredible, Nee‐san.`
` I can {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} all 48."`
`"Observe the interception priority ordering.`
` Trust your nee‐san."`
`"Of course.`
` I don't even need to open my eyes."`
`"Commence interception."`
`"T‐targets unharmed!!`
` I‐it was intercepted...!!"`
`"Nihyah?!`
` All 48?!"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho......`
` Shannon and Kanon were originally a furniture pair, you see.`
` They're strong when they're together.`
` ...Owowow.`
` ...I wonder if this is going to become a mouth ulcer..."`
`"Calm down, reload.`
` ......Updating ammo type.`
` Precision light‐speed sniper rounds.`
` Prepare for precision sniping."`
`"Sounds good nyeh! Impossible to intercept super high‐speed rounds!`
` Impossible to defend against for a mere Gatekeeper nyeh!"`
`"Precision sniping understood.`
` Commencing collection of precision firing data........."`
`"Wh‐what in the world was that just now......?"`
`"Don't worry, I'm as clueless as you...`
` All I know is that we'd be dead if we hadn't relied on those two..."`
`"Kanon‐kun, thanks.`
` Go back to the metal bars.`
` Next will probably come a shot that you can't intercept."`
`"How do we block against such an attack...?!"`
`"We don't let them shoot.`
` ......Kanon‐kun, spirit particle combat, guard yourself."`
`At those words, Kanon closed his eyes tightly and clenched his teeth.`
`{n}......With Shannon at the center, a pressure and impact blasted out that could only be perceived by those not human.`
`"......Huh?!`
` Firing system error!!`
` No good, rebooting...`
` Huh, huh?!"`
`"Spirit wave jamming! Spirit particle protection, move it!`
` What are you doing, cover your ears, 45!!!"`
`An unseen, unheard impact blasted towards the Chiester Sisters.`
`00 and 410 crouched down, covering their ears...but 45 didn't make it in time.`
`......Still standing bolt upright, her eyes rolled inside her head.`
`"Ukyu...?!?!"`
`"...Kyuu? Kyuu!`
` Kyuu`
`kyuu`
`kyu~!!!"`
`"45, damaged...!`
` Her compiler engine's gone kaput...!!`
` ......U...gya, ......the noise...is horrible for me too nyeh......"`
`"45,`
` 410,`
` ......and 00,`
` damaged...`
` Abandoning sniping.`
` ......Ack, it came straight through the link......`
` H‐have to reboot..."`
`Raising their spirit particle sensitivity for precision sniping had backfired.`
`They had taken the full brunt of the spirit particle shock wave Shannon had released,`
` and not only 45, who had been hit directly, but also 00 and 410, who had been linked with her, were taken down.`
`"Are you alright?!`
` ......I'll make you some more delicious black tea later, okay? Hold together!"`
`"M‐......my apologies, ma'am......`
` We'll reboot.`
` Please wait a few hundred seconds......"`
`All of the Chiester Sisters collapsed.`
` They would probably get back up eventually, but it looked like it would be hard for them to return to the battle lines for a while.`
`"So, furniture was able to repel weapons, if for but a moment.`
` .........I see, the plots which entertain that child truly are filled with unexpected turns!"`
`{f:5:Virgilia} tore the air with a large motion as though opening a door.`
`"Come, arise, goat attendants...!`
` It's time for work.`
` Kill and capture the escapees.`
` Corpses are fine, we can just revive them anyway!"`
`A gold‐colored door opened in the air, and countless giant goats with muscular bodies peeked their faces out...`
`"Come now, hurry.`
` There are five escapees, so the fastest five of you win!`
` There will be a wonderful prize! Come on now, go for it, go for it!"`
`{f:5:Virgilia} clapped her hands, urging them on.`
`A prize?!`
` After glancing at each other at those words, the goats rushed to the door at once, trying to get out,`
` making the exit as tight a squeeze as the trains during the commuter rush.`
`Each wanted to get out first, so none of them could get out.`
`{n}......{f:5:Virgilia} held her head in frustration.`
`By that time, Kanon had managed to cut just enough bars to make a gap that could be slipped through.`
`It proved a bit of work for Krauss, large as he was, and Nanjo, whose waist was nearly his downfall, but even so, they all managed to make it through.`
`But their relief at getting through was short‐lived.`
`Immediately, another set of metal bars blocked the way in front of them.`
`"The security sure is tough.`
` ......I bet they really didn't want the people in here to escape."`
`"Kanon, sorry, but I'll have to ask you again.`
` ......I'm sure it's tough on you, but please...!"`
`There was sweat on Kanon's forehead.`
`You could tell at a glance that cutting the metal bars, which had been made even more solid by magic, was exhausting him considerably.`
`"......Yes, leave it to me, Krauss‐sama."`
`"Only you can do it!`
` Please, we're counting on you...!"`
`Only he...could do it.`
` ......Holding tightly onto those words,`
` Kanon concentrated his mind again and once more set himself to the task of cutting the bars.`
`".........Enemies are coming from behind. Multiple."`
`"Yes, this time, even we can tell.`
` ......The ground's really shaking.`
` I can tell that some terrible monsters are rushing at us."`
`"Don't worry.`
` I'll seal the bars we just came through with a magic lock.`
` Goats won't be able to break it."`
`Shannon held her hand out towards the bars they had come through.`
`......But she stopped right away.`
`"Wh‐what is it...?"`
`"{f:5:Virgilia}‐sama has started neutralizing the spirit wave jamming...`
` It'll be bad if it's broken—we'll lose the initiative once the Chiester Sisters are rebooted...!"`
`"I'll make you pay in full for bullying these cute rabbits."`
`"If you're trying to gain the advantage with those crafty little spirit particles, I'll tear all that off and rob you of them."`
`"Nee‐san, concentrate on the spirit wave jamming!`
` The gap in those bars is too narrow for those goats.`
` It should hold them back for a while...!"`
`"I don't have a clue what you're saying, but—"`
`"We at least got the point that it's something pretty bad."`
`Kyrie picked up a metal bar that Kanon had just cut.`
`{n}Krauss had no weapon, but he rubbed his fist, and the two of them glared into the depths of the underground passage where the shaking was coming from.`
`"......I believe this set of bars is the final thing blocking the way."`
`"How far is it to the mansion from here?"`
`"Quite a walk...`
` The path is even, but I seem to remember walking for thirty minutes......"`
`"So if we run flat out, it'll be half that time."`
`They couldn't tell for sure since they didn't have the three‐sided mirror,`
` but there was no guarantee that George and Jessica could hold out against demon opponents for all that time.`
`"......If we run at twice walking speed, it'll be fifteen minutes.`
` And running at twice that speed again would make it eight minutes."`
`"And if we sprint flat out at double that speed again, it won't even take five.`
` No sweat."`
`"Wh‐what an unreasonable calculation...`
` But calculations in dire emergencies do tend to be that way...!"`
`"......My sincere apologies, everyone.`
` The rest will be up to you...!"`
`"Leave it to us.`
` Kanon, you cut the bars as fast as you can.`
` Shannon, you concentrate on jamming this witch called {f:5:Virgilia} or whatever.`
` Kyrie‐san and I will defend against the pursuers...!"`
`Then, the roars of beasts rang out from the darkness, and numerous fiery, glowing, bright‐red eyes appeared.`
`The goats rushing towards them, with thunderous force, were several levels more massive than the guards had been.`
`The tremors they created were almost like an earthquake.`
`{n}The power and terror was tremendous, but Kyrie instead laughed with relief.`
`{n}......Those massive bodies wouldn't be able to go through the gap in the bars!`
`The group of goats crashed into the metal bars with a terrific sound like that of a train colliding with a dead end.`
`Clumps of dirt fell here and there from the ceiling, and you could tell that the metal bars had buckled inwards.`
`.....The force of their charge must have been no different from a train.`
`{n}If the metal bars hadn't been there, they would undoubtedly have swallowed the five of them up and crushed them in an instant.`
`When the group of goats, pressed up against the metal bars, realized that the five were right in front of them,`
` they let out a terrible howl, trying to intimidate the five.`
`......Although it was hard to tell whether that was really intimidation, or because of the pain from being pushed and shoved.`
`One calm goat among them figured out that it just needed to do something about the metal bars,`
` and grabbed two of them with its massive arms, and began bending them as though opening double doors.`
`Kyrie sharply jabbed her metal pole at that goat's vitals...!`
` The goat let out a roar of anguish.`
`It probably hurt a lot, but that was all.`
`{n}It wasn't enough to bring it down...`
`"Krauss‐san...!!"`
`"Rrroooaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`Still holding the stuck‐in metal pole, Kyrie relinquished the opposite tip to Krauss.`
`Krauss ran there with all his might, leapt into the air and kicked it in with all his weight and kicking power combined...!`
`All of that destructive power was focused on that single pole, drilling it in!!`
`"......A‐are you alright?`
` Please don't rub the affected area.`
` I shall prescribe some medicine later. Take care..."`
`As the goat who had taken a pile bunker to its vitals writhed with teary eyes,`
` it nodded its head.`
`"Looks like our link isn't that bad either.`
` We can't let Shannon‐chan and Kanon‐kun beat us."`
`"Naturally. We are a loving family, after all."`
`"We can take them if it's two‐on‐one!`
` Next, that one on the right!"`
`"Roger...!`
` You seem like a great wife. That Rudolf, I'm starting to think he grumbled a little too much."`
`"Oh? You'll have to tell me about that later.`
` Rudolf‐san, it's no use you turning white in heaven, it's too late for excuses."`
`The goat's massive body sank into the rose bush.`
` Even taking into account that a leg's power is three times that of an arm's, this strength surpassed common sense.`
`That massive body, flying up and through the air from being kicked in the chin...it was too epic!`
`Even George seemed a little surprised.`
`"......To think that my kick works on monsters too.`
` I'm astonished."`
`"...............It's because of your counterattacking‐type barrier.`
` ......The attack power that grazes you is added on to your own.`
` ......The superhuman power of those monsters has been added to your kicks..."`
`"Hmm......`
` ...I don't really get it, but isn't that just perfect for me?`
` ......If you're going to attack me, then no matter who you are, you should be prepared for a counterattack of equal measure.`
` Nonaggressive defense.`
` That's exactly my policy."`
`That's why Gaap couldn't easily touch him.`
`The counterattacking‐type barrier had no defensive power.`
` However, because of its counterattacking characteristic, it could be useful in defense by making the opponent hesitate to attack.`
`The goats were foolish, so they attacked without worrying,`
` but the effect was being realized to the full against Gaap.`
`"These guys really are dull.`
` When your power is even, it's better to be of a smaller build."`
`He lightly dodged the log‐like arm.`
`When that arm touched the barrier that protected George, it let off a strong, red light.`
`......And the tip of the foot that was counterattacking gained the same shine, and the superhuman power of the goat was added to George's own.`
`The second goat fell forwards and floated in the air for a second.`
`{n}Then, George's next roundhouse kick missed right over the falling goat's head.`
`......For an instant, the goat hoped to get away with its life.`
`But no!!`
` A heel was dropped onto the back of its head, and it was forced to kiss the ground.`
`"......Going from a high roundhouse kick into a neri chagi is pretty basic, right?`
` It connects pretty often if you don't overuse it."`
`"This guy's......a problem,`
` ...seriously a problem......!!"`
`"Demons? Witches? Get real.`
` .........The rulers of Rokkenjima are this Ushiromiya family.`
` I will teach that to you with every ounce of strength in my body."`
`".........Yoooouuuu.........!!"`
`The only way to finish off George now that his body was wrapped up in the counterattacking‐type barrier...was to not allow him a counterattack.`
`......Next time she sucked him into the Abyss, she would have to kick and drop him, kick and drop him, kick and drop him,`
` until she kicked him to death!!!`
`But George had already perfected reading the faint warning signs that told of the appearance of Gaap's pitfalls.`
`......If he managed to jump over that next pit,`
` ......then this time, he would probably pulverize Gaap's head with his whirlwind‐like kick, without holding back in the slightest,`
` ......just as had been done to his parents.`
`She was able to envision that scene vividly.`
`It was far too late now, but Gaap cursed Kinzo all the same for calling her out to this ridiculous island...!`
`Ronove finally started using both of his hands to form his shield.`
`Without a more powerful shield, he wouldn't be able to completely block Jessica's fists anymore.`
`The enchantment on Jessica's fists grew the more she fought.`
`The permeation upgrade had already stacked several times,`
` and those fists had also been given an impact upgrade, a piercing upgrade, and a speed upgrade, making them fists worthy to fight on par with a demon...`
`".........What's wrong?!`
` Starting to get tired?!`
` You're getting all slow!!"`
`"No.`
` Your movements, thoughts, and kinetic vision have been exponentially enchanted.`
` .........My movements have not changed from the beginning.`
` ......Your movements are beginning to capture me."`
`"And you still won't fight back...?!!"`
`"This is the style which I insist upon.`
` ......However, I cannot allow things to continue as they are.`
` It's about time for me to get serious and end this......!!"`
`Ronove's face turned into an expression he had never shown before.`
`{n}It was truly demonic, and to Jessica's eyes, full of respect.`
`Because it was an expression only shown to enemies strong enough to make him get serious.`
`"Whooaa?!?!`
` What the heck?!"`
`With a whole‐body gesture that you couldn't call elegant, Ronove set up a shield with all his strength, the size and thickness of a wall.`
`Its sturdiness was nothing like a shield.`
` It was literally a wall.`
`And on top of that, with all of Ronove's magical power, it pushed Jessica back bit by bit.`
`......Did he plan on pushing her back against the wall and crushing her to death?`
`Jessica tried to break through the wall with both fists, but it was solid.`
` ......Without any exaggeration, it was solid!`
`"You call this serious...?!!`
` No problem... I'll break right through iiiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiitt!!"`
`"I will not let you this time.`
` This wall is somewhat different.`
` ......Here, allow me to enchant it as well."`
`Ronove made magic signs with his fingers almost like a ninja;`
` the wall glowed red for just an instant, and became imbued with some kind of ominous power.`
`Almost immediately, Jessica also gained a firsthand understanding of this.`
`Every time she pounded her fists against the wall, pain rebounded upon her as though glass fragments had scattered and hit all over her body.`
`"I upgraded it with attack‐reactive armor.`
` An exceptional item which will decrease the force of your attacks by counterbalancing them,`
` and can even counterattack with reactive fragments."`
`"......You are perfectly welcome to keep punching it, but doing so will affect you as well."`
`"Heh, ...heheh!!`
` So it's an endurance test between me and your wall?!!`
` Fine by me!!"`
`"Will you fall to your knees first, or be pushed into the wall first?`
` ......Allow me to observe."`
`"Or, I might break through it and smash that whole wall along with your face, ever think about that?!`
` Just watch meeeeeeeeeee!!"`
`Without hesitation, Jessica slammed both fists into the wall.`
`{n}Each time she did, a large amount of shards scattered, tormenting her body all over.`
`Countless red cuts soon appeared all over her body...`
`She grimaced at the intense pain, but her eyes were burning with fighting spirit, and her lips curved in a grin exactly the opposite of the pain...!`
`"Kanon, are you done yet?!`
` We are alright,`
` ......but I can't say the same for the bars holding those guys in check...!"`
`"Just......a little more......!"`
`"There's no end to these guys...`
` The bars might break just from them shoving each other!"`
`The metal bars creaked under the strain of the group of goats.`
`{n}Several arms grabbed the bars, twisting them with superhuman strength.`
`......However, some bars were being pulled in opposite directions by different hands.`
` Apparently they really were stupid.`
`The way those countless hands were grabbing the metal bars......happened to match up by chance.`
`Several hands grasping two metal bars neatly put their power together and pulled the bars to the left and right, creating an opening.`
`The incredible sound of metal bending could be heard, and that gap was getting larger bit by bit...!`
`They attacked the arms of those goats one by one, but they weren't getting anywhere.`
`{n}They couldn't stop the gap from expanding left and right...!`
`A loud metallic sound came from behind them.`
`{n}Kanon had finally finished cutting.`
`"Quickly!!"`
`"Kyrie‐san, ladies first.`
` You next, Doctor Nanjo!"`
`"Krauss‐sama, please leave this place to me...!`
` Ngh, ......what?!"`
`Kanon's red sword, with which he had cut the metal bars, disappeared.`
`"......Sorry!`
` We've entered {f:5:Virgilia}‐sama's spirit particle combat area of influence!!`
` Our magic power is being neutralized!"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` I am impressed that you put up such a fight against a Great Witch like me...`
` You can no longer use your magic in that underground passage."`
`A magic circle column drew complex magical formulae around {f:5:Virgilia}.`
`......With such full‐fledged magic being used, Shannon's power couldn't even compete.`
`On the contrary, it was surprising that she had withstood as much as she had.`
`"Spirit particle superiority ensured.`
` Come, Chiester Sisters. Now it's your turn."`
`"Wait, are you still rebooting?!`
` Why are kids so bad at waking up these days...?!"`
`"M‐my apologies, ma'am...!!`
` We're all different versions..."`
`"Why is it that the shortcuts and pulldown menus get all screwed up every time you change versions nyeh...!`
` Did not shut down successfully last time?`
` Administrator privileges??`
` What is all this nonsense!!"`
`"Ukyu~~!!`
` Ukyu~~!!`
` (Fix me quickly~!! Waaaah!)"`
`"Calling Imperial Guards troubleshooting!`
` What?`
` You won't tell us without a user code?!"`
`"45 is in control of the user code nyeh."`
`"Ukyuu!!`
` U,`
` kyu,`
` kyu,`
` kyo,`
` ukyu,`
` kyuu!!!"`
`"A‐all I can hear is {ruby:kyuu‐kyuu‐kyuu‐kyuu:9999}......`
` Have her write it on some paper."`
`"Her language support system hasn't come back up, so she can't even write nyeh."`
`"...........................`
` Y‐you take your time fixing yourselves...`
` I'll go myself..."`
`""Sorryyyyyyyyy~!!""`
`The narrow underground passage was packed with goats, truly like a commuter train in the morning.`
`{f:5:Virgilia} was again in disbelief at this congestion.`
`"What are you doing...?!!"`
`"Huh?`
` You want to be first because you want the prize?`
` You're getting in each other's way because you don't want the others to steal the prize from you?"`
`"You stupid goooooooooooooaaaaaaats!!!`
` I'm going myself, so open the way!!"`
`"What?!`
` You don't want to?!`
` {f:5:Virgilia}‐sama is trying to steal the prize?!"`
`"Why are you forming a scrum?!!"`
`"Aaah, it's so crammed and tight!!`
` When did this become a goats‐only car?!`
` Ugyu~~!!`
` Whoever just touched my butt, get off at the next statioo~~n!!!"`
`".........Hm? What do you want?`
` Come this way, you say??"`
`The five people in Krauss's group dashed through the passageway with all their strength!`
`{n}They couldn't afford to dawdle around underground.`
`They had to quickly join up with the children on the surface!`
`{n}Once everyone was together, there would no longer be anything to fear!`
`Just then, a terrible rumble started closing in from behind.`
`{n}Had the pursuers finally made it through the metal bars?!`
`But they couldn't see anyone when they turned around.`
`But that rumble and the dirt falling here and there from the ceiling grew closer and closer,`
` finally catching up with them and even going past them.`
`It felt almost like they had been passed by ghosts.`
`The instant after they thought that nothing had happened, the ceiling in front of them fell in, and a single goat stood in their path.`
`......{f:5:Virgilia} was sitting on its shoulder.`
`"This wise child knew a shortcut.`
` What a good kid, you get first prize.`
` Later, I'll treat you to some homemade mackerel curry."`
`Maybe it really was happy even to receive such a dubious prize.`
` The massive goat showed its joy by putting its hands together and wiggling.`
`{f:5:Virgilia} leapt down, laughing that now it was finally checkmate.`
`"......Damn...... It's no good...`
` ......Our magic has been completely killed..."`
`"...It's too early to give up...`
` ......Even without magic, we still have our bodies..."`
`"D‐don't be ridiculous...!`
` There's no way you could fight a monster like that without that strange power...!"`
`"......S‐stay back, children..."`
`"I'll handle them somehow, so you escape past that monster while I'm keeping him busy...!"`
`"I won't let you.`
` Hohhohohohohoho!"`
`{f:5:Virgilia} clapped her hands, and a purple magic barrier appeared behind her,`
` stealing even the faint hope that Krauss had been betting on.`
`"Is there...nothing more to be done......?`
` ...N‐no, there's still a chance.`
` ......Even Jessica fought.`
` I must do the same..."`
`"A‐are you serious?!`
` It's not possible, not against that massive monster...!"`
`"Don't be absurd...!`
` Krauss‐san, let us think of another way......"`
`"If you think of something, I'm open to suggestions.`
` Until then, it looks like I'll have to manage something...`
` ......Come on, get back."`
`"......Be careful."`
`"Hohohoho...hohhohohohohohohoho!`
` My, my, Krauss.`
` You intend to fight this child alone?"`
`"........................khh...`
` Y‐you never know.`
` In a fight, it's always possible to get in a lucky shot..."`
`"Hohhohohoho.`
` You think you can win even with a fluke...?`
` Allow me to explain the situation for you, since you clearly don't know your place."`
`"Whaat......?"`
`"Hohohoho...`
` Assuming you were to wield 100% of your strength, your power level is at most 6.`
` In comparison, this child has a power level of 1000.`
` In short, even if there were 100 of you, you could never win."`
`"Well, it's true that there are uncertain elements in a fight.`
` I will admit that your power level has a slight scaling factor to it."`
`"But even so, your chances of defeating him are around perhaps 0.00001%.`
` Do you understand?`
` You don't even have a one in ten thousand chance of victory.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho...!"`
`{f:5:Virgilia} and the goat guffawed together.`
`"D‐...damn it......`
` If it's a one in ten thousand chance, then the payoff will be ten thousand times more, will it not?`
` ......A good dark horse.`
` I like betting tickets like that, makes me want to buy them..."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!`
` But the coin to buy that is your life, and there's only one of those, you know.`
` Nevertheless, I can understand the feeling of wanting to entrust your fate to that miracle."`
`"......Which is why, in praise of your courage for standing against us without fear, I shall give you a bit of a handicap.`
` This child will fight with only his left arm.`
` Well, even so, I can't imagine for a moment that he'll lose to you."`
`"............Seriously, what is that thing that keeps going bing‐bong‐bing‐bong?"`
`"V‐......very well.`
` I'll accept that challenge......`
` Left arm or whatever else, I'm sure I'd be killed with a single strike in any case.`
` ......I also only have a single chance at a strike.`
` I can only bet everything on that."`
`"That's absurd, Krauss‐san...!`
` I, I know that you used to do boxing, but I believe that was from your college days...`
` No, no, even if there were a pro boxer here, there's no way he could defeat a monster like that with just one strike...!"`
`"......That would be true if it were a match in the ring.`
` But Krauss nii‐san does have an admittedly small chance that he can set his hopes on.`
` ......He's setting all his hopes on that one chance..."`
`"Y‐you aren't saying......`
` But...there's no way that's going to work..."`
`"......Krauss‐sama........."`
`"W‐watch me...`
` I'll settle this with a single strike......"`
`Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` How unwise.`
`{n}I know what you're gunning for.`
`{n}The distance between the two of them is more than 10 meters.`
`If the goat and Krauss both step in with all their strength to settle the fight with a single blow, their power will be double the norm.`
`{n}Both will crash together, so it will be a relative 4 times normal.`
`Even if, on top of that, the strike miraculously lands on a weak point for a critical hit, that will only double the power.`
`.........In short, Krauss's maximum power level of 6, times 8, will cap out at 48 at the most.`
`He might just barely be able to win if he repeated that lucky shot a full 20 times.`
`Hohhohohohoho, if you're killed every time you take a hit, and your damage still accumulates,`
` .......let's see, perhaps you could finally win when we get to Episode 24?`
`Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho, if only this series could stretch on so long...!!`
` Either way, you don't even have the slightest chance of victory!`
`......Good gracious, what is that bing‐bong I keep hearing?`
`"I will be betting everything on a single strike...`
` You have no reason to hold back either.`
` Give it everything you've got..."`
`"Hohohoho, he's requesting that you go all out.`
` Pulverize him with a single all‐out strike, and turn him into chunks of meat."`
`As the goat got excited and beat its chest over and over, it took a position as though preparing for a sprint.`
`Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho, is this what you were hoping for?`
`Stake your hopes on your greatest power level, and despair when even that doesn't reach at all!`
`It pinged again!`
` That thing is really getting on my nerves, what {i:is} it?!`
`"Here I come......`
` Ready?"`
`The goat roared in response.`
`Then, with a matched timing that only the men confronting each other could comprehend,`
` ......the two leapt forward like bullets shot out of a gun.`
`The men howled, collecting the strength from all over their bodies into one arm each.`
`The goat's fiery glowing eyes clearly locked onto Krauss's face.`
`......He could perfectly see a vision of when he would step forwards,`
` when he would punch through Krauss and blow him away,`
` and when he would achieve his total victory.`
`The long, painful days before today drifted through the goat's mind......`
`The hard days of training where his senpais had picked on him...`
`The faint glimpses of his senpais' warm concern during those days.`
`And the joy of that day his power had been acknowledged, and he had been accepted as one of the team...!`
`I never properly respected my parents.`
`......That's right, I'd actually planned on washing my hands of this business when this job was over, and returning to my hometown.`
`Sorry, my little goat sister...your onii‐chan caused you nothing but trouble.`
`And I, ...a‐actually have a childhood friend, and I'm going to marry her when I get hoooooome!!!`
`"Gyaaaaaaaaahh!!!`
` Nooooooooooo!!`
` Don't trip so many {c:86EF9C:loser flaaaaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aags}!!"`
`"You can't handle that punch, dodge iiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`It happened the instant before the two crashed and their punches crossed.`
`"Foolish, {f:5:Virgilia}.`
` It looks like you couldn't make a composed decision."`
`"You must not take that punch!!`
` Deflect it!!"`
`"?!?!"`
`The very instant the goat's left straight and Krauss's right straight crossed!`
` The goat obeyed {f:5:Virgilia}'s order with super‐fast reflexes and pulled back his straight, deflecting Krauss's punch!`
`".........mmgh—"`
`Yes, {f:5:Virgilia}'s decision was probably wise.`
`{n}After all, the number of loser flags act as a multiplier on the opponent's power level!`
`"That was close.`
` If you had taken that punch after tripping so many loser flags, imagine just how great a force it would have been multiplied to...!!"`
`"Come on, from there, smash the completely open right side of his face with a right straight!!"`
`"What?`
` The promise about fighting with only your left arm?"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho!!`
` Promises are made to be brokennnnn!!"`
`"Gyaah, tripped another ooooooone!!"`
`"I'm disappointed, {f:5:Virgilia}.`
` You really were lacking composure."`
`"What's that......?!`
` How was I not composed by noticing it beforehand and making him avoid it...?!"`
`"Wh‐...why is that, Kyrie‐sama...?`
` If they had crashed like that, wouldn't Krauss‐sama have won......?"`
`".........Ah, I, I see...!`
` Even with 20 loser flags,`
` ......that's still not enough!"`
`Krauss's and the goat's double rush make it x4.`
`{n}With a miracle on their side, the firm promise of a critical hit would double it again for x8.`
`On top of that, a multiplier of x20 equal to the number of tripped loser flags applies, making it x160.`
`At a glance, that looks like an incredible amplification, but even so, Krauss's power level is 6.`
`{n}Even multiplied by 160, it only makes for a power level of 960.`
`{n}Just a fraction below the goat's 1000...!`
`"That's why I said you weren't composed.`
` You made a blunder.`
` If they had crashed like that, you would have won."`
`"H‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!!`
` Even if that were so, it all comes to the same thing if this right straight smashes Krauss's head!!`
` Die, Ushiromiya Krauss!!!"`
`"......Take this...the most powerful blow in the world of boxing."`
`Having deflected Krauss's right straight,`
` the goat's own right straight closed in on the right side of Krauss's face, which had been left open...`
`But there, it crossed with a left straight from Krauss...`
`The two punches crossed, and time stopped as each aimed for the face of the other......`
`"Ho.........hohohoho.`
` To think that it would be brought to a simultaneous strike at a moment like this!`
` But his power level caps out at x160, making it 960!!`
` You never made it to my child's 1000...!"`
`".........No.`
` {f:5:Virgilia}‐san.`
` ......You've lost."`
`"Why?!"`
`"You made your goat deflect the first cross‐counter.`
` ......Certainly, if the right straight he issued after that were to hit, Krauss‐san would probably be in pieces."`
`"...However, that was crossed...`
` ......That's just no good.`
` I'm afraid this is a complete loss for your goat."`
`A cross‐counter has four times the destructive power.`
`{n}This is common knowledge in boxing.`
`And if that is deflected, and the right straight hits, then the double cross‐counter has 8 times the destructive power.`
`{n}This is also common knowledge in boxing.`
`If that is crossed......`
`{n}By the principle of leverage, the triple cross then multiplies the destructive power by 12!`
`This is also painfully common knowledge in the world of boxing!!`
`".........Krauss‐san's power level is 6."`
`"A double multiplier from both sides for rushing in, making it times 4."`
`"Th‐the critical hit makes it times 8."`
`"Up to times 160 for tripping too many loser flags."`
`"......And times 12 on top of that for the triple cross‐counter."`
`"T‐......times 1920......"`
`A power level of...11520...!!`
` Krauss's punch now had the power to easily win that Budokai tournament...!!!`
`"......This result was brought about by Krauss‐san's persistence in not giving up on victory until the end, ......and your conceit.`
` Without either, it would never have become so powerful..."`
`"......You fought well.`
` .........It's okay, you can fall now..."`
`Nanjo patted the goat on the shoulder...`
`......O‐......onii‐chan...gave it his all......`
`As the sparkling drops from the goat's eyes scattered, he softly toppled backwards,`
` and flattened {f:5:Virgilia} like a pancake.`
`"Ugyaa!!`
` Heavyyyyyyy, get oooffffff!"`
`The goat's massive body was too heavy for the slender {f:5:Virgilia}.`
`{n}She floundered around with it on top of her, but it didn't look like she would be able to escape.`
`In that instant, the barrier {f:5:Virgilia} had sealed broke.`
`"No hard feelings, please.`
` Underestimating the principle of leverage was the cause of your defeat."`
`"......I wonder why the principle of leverage worked on that counter.`
` It's an eternal mystery."`
`"Let's escape while we can...!!`
` You take care, {nobr:Mr. Goat}...!"`
`"W‐well then, excuse us, {f:5:Virgilia}‐sama!"`
`".........*bow*."`
`"Waaaaaaaaiiit!!`
` Get back heeeere!!`
` Get this thing off meeeeee!!`
` Kiiii!! Gapgapgapgap!!!"`
`There was nothing more to block their way.`
`{n}......They ran through the underground passage with single‐minded purpose...!`
`Jessica had finally been cornered with the wall at her back.`
`{n}......Ronove's magic barrier was advancing bit by bit, and would probably crush her against the wall before long.`
`Considering the distance...this would be the final strike, the final throw of her iron fist.`
`Jessica had dealt out many punches so far.`
`......The wall wasn't invincible.`
` It had already started to crack, and it wouldn't be strange for it to smash at any moment.`
`However, due to the rebounding damage,`
` Jessica herself was in very bad shape, with cuts all over her body.`
`"......Just stop this now.`
` I don't intend to crush you.`
` It is up to the Master to decide how to deal with you.`
` ......However, I do intend to put in a good word for your impressive fight."`
`"N‐`
`.........no...frigging...`
`...way...`
` ......Not yet......`
` It's not......over yet........."`
`"......You have wounds all over your body.`
` It's all you can manage just to stand, is it not?`
` ......It seems that you plan on putting all of your strength into this final strike.`
` However, that final strike will instead prove fatal for you."`
`The damage reflected by Ronove's magic barrier was proportional to the strength of the attack.`
`{n}Jessica's all‐out punch would be bounced back onto her.`
`......The more all‐out she went, the more suicidal it would be for her.`
`"I, I get it......`
` I know that........."`
`"I am warning you.`
` Stop this now.`
` It is for your own good."`
`"Stop bluffing.`
` Your wall is about to break, right...?`
` I've been the one punching it, you think I can't feel that.........?"`
`"........................"`
`That was...a fact.`
` Ronove's wall was already on the verge of breaking.`
`And on top of that,`
` Jessica's fists had been imbued with an unimaginable magical attack power by now, and their destructive power defied the imagination.`
`......If she wasn't careful, that destructive power might pierce the defensive wall, smash Ronove as well,`
` and then go on to expand the size of her bedroom by connecting it to the room next door.`
`......However, that damage would rebound on Jessica as well.`
`{n}She wouldn't escape unharmed!`
`"I will say it just one more time.`
` Stop.`
` I say this out of consideration for you!"`
`"Shut the hell up......`
` .........Say your prayers."`
`Jessica howled.`
` ......Putting all her strength and her last and greatest destructive power into her fist, she roared......`
`The three goats had been beaten down long ago.`
` Without a single ragged breath, George cautiously closed the distance between him and Gaap.`
`......He was after her.`
` He was planning on bringing her down with a single strike...`
`Gaap was also aiming for a single strike.`
`{n}.........If she let that chance slide, this time, she would be killed......`
`"......Aren't you going to use your pitfalls?"`
`"............Ack......"`
`Even the tiny moment of weakness during the time it took to open the hole would prove fatal against George now.`
`......Gaap cautiously calculated the distance and timing, but even as she did, George closed the gap between them...`
`".........If you won't move forward, then I will."`
`"......C‐......come on then...`
` No more tricks.`
` ......This kick of mine...`
`...will end this!"`
`The instant she noticed George's body blur, ......only his jacket was floating in the air.`
`A short sound of realization entered her mind, and in that instant, darkness covered her.`
`George, with his heel swung up high, looked even like a massive dragon attacking from the sky.`
`"Y‐you fell for it......`
` ......I win, Ushiromiya George!!"`
`"What—"`
`Gaap opened a vast pit with her in the center, and swallowed up George along with herself...!!`
`The two were swallowed up by the pit, and spat out from the ceiling of the arbor.`
`But that was what Gaap had been after, so she alone landed lightly.`
` ......But there was another pit in George's landing spot.`
`"Ehheheheheheheh, aaaahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!!`
` Got you, Ushiromiya Geooooooo{-}o{-}o{-}orge!!"`
`"It's been fun die now,`
` it would be a waste for someone as good as you to end up as the Ushiromiya family head,`
` so I'll eat you up right here, right now!!!`
` Oooooorrrrrooo{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}oa{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!"`
`George once again fell from the ceiling of the arbor.`
` He had probably been dropped the same distance as falling off the roof of a two‐story building.`
`In midair, he couldn't control his posture in any way.`
`{n}It was impossible to resist or defend or avoid!!`
`As Gaap spun like a whirlwind, she concentrated all of her energy on the sharp tip of her stiletto heel.`
`......This was the final strike...to perform his requiem.`
`{n}The queen bee's final strike, that would bore into heaven, knocking him down into the true Abyss!!`
`"Welcome to the Abyss!!`
` This is the end of the line for you!!!"`
`Her prey captured in her sight, she launched her foot up into the sky.`
`......It was then that she saw George's face.`
` .........Even though he was in midair, he was calmly adjusting his glasses with the middle finger of his left hand.`
`And his posture was still preserved as that of an axe kick.`
`{n}Aiming for Gaap's forehead, without the faintest deviation......`
`".........I already anticipated that you would opt for that move."`
`"............Wh...at.........?"`
`"If I'd jumped to make the person that was {i:on the ground} taste my heel, my posture would have collapsed long ago.`
` .........However, my posture hasn't collapsed in the slightest.`
` Do you know why?"`
`"......You...`
`...don't...`
`mean......"`
`"From the very beginning,`
` ......I jumped to make the person that was two stories below taste my heel!!!"`
`"Uungh, ......ooooooo{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}h{0}h{0}h{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhhh!!!"`
`"You lose, missy!!!"`
`"Bing‐bong."`
`"Unnggggrrrroooooaaaaaaahhh, take thiiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiiss!!!"`
`Jessica's last and strongest upwards punch...`
`reached the wall,`
` ......and was sucked in.`
`It was sucked into the black, large hole that had suddenly opened on the wall.`
`"Well, .........I did advise you to stop."`
`"What.........the............"`
`"......Ghhg............ah......"`
`"Truth is,`
` .........I was never in even the slightest little bit of trouble.`
` Soorry..."`
`......Jessica's fist had gone for George's stomach,`
` ......and George's axe kick had lined up on Jessica's head.`
`The shocking destructive power imbued in Jessica's fist crushed George's organs and scattered his abdomen.`
`The equally‐as‐shocking destructive power in George's axe kick smashed half of Jessica's head, and scattered its contents in the same manner......`
`"Pfft, ...ahhahahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` I mean, come onnnn.`
` Witches are all about the acting, riiiiight?`
` Hey, Riiche, how was it, were you watching...?"`
`"Wahahaha, waaaahhyahhyahhya, aaakkyakkyakkya!!`
` Not baaad, followed the script to a T!`
` You really do get it, Gaap!!`
` Woohoo!!"`
`Beato and Gaap gave each other a light high five.`
`"......hhh...`
`...aaahh...`
`............hhhhhhuuAAAA{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}AAHHH!!!"`
`"Thanks, Ronove.`
` That was a treat.`
` I'll return Jessica's corpse back there.`
` ......Separate the corpses of the two who are close.`
` ......Is the second twilight done now?"`
`Gaap dropped Jessica's corpse into a pit,`
` and chucked all the chunks of meat, too, into Jessica's room,`
` as carelessly as throwing them into the trash...`
`Jessica's corpse and lumps of flesh fell from the ceiling and poured out all over her room.`
`Ronove shook his head slightly at this all‐too‐gruesome change.`
`"............My apologies, Jessica‐sama.`
` I did warn you."`
`"Of course,`
` ...I suppose it's only natural that a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} like yourself can't understand the demonic pleasure I derive from foreseeing this conclusion and giving you repeated warnings that I know you won't listen to.`
` ......Pukkuku{0}ku{0}ku{0}ku{0}ku{0}ku{0}kukuku!"`
`"It really was fun, kiddo.`
` ......But you play with words a little too much.`
` ......I think ‘If you're ready, may I fight back’ was the absolute classic?`
` Eheheh, you've been reading a few too many light novels or something, you know?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`In the arbor brutally decorated by George and Jessica's scattered blood and guts,`
` Gaap enjoyed a loud laugh for a while...`
`...But she quickly realized that, in all seriousness, this was a little too filthy and undignified, and she snapped her fingers.`
`As she did, gold butterflies rose up from the ground all around the garden,`
` stuck to each of the bits and stained patches of blood, and got them out.`
`......Then, bit by bit, they slowly turned back into George's corpse,`
` and the awful corpse with its guts splattered out was repaired into a clean corpse that looked like it was sleeping.`
`Was this some kind of post‐mortem sportsmanship towards a good opponent............?`
`The heavens were slowly split.`
`......Because Gaap had lifted a leg high into the air, pointing at the sky.`
`"So long, lady killer.`
` This is the real Game Over."`
`Squish.`
` ......Without a trace of mercy, that foot was brought down,`
` ......and buried into George's forehead.`
`Her stiletto heel, sharp as a weapon, was impaled through George's forehead.`
`She......pulled it out with a blorp......`
`It was like a mark of proof that Gaap had indeed finished him by her own hand......`
`Ronove returned Jessica's corpse to its original form as well.`
`{n}......And unlike how it had been with George, he also restored Jessica's life......`
`"...U‐...nff, .........*cough*, *cough*......`
`......what in the.........world......`
` ......A dream......?"`
`"No, that is wrong.`
` ......You certainly did pass away, Jessica‐sama.`
` You should be well aware of the memory of your final moments."`
`It was burnt into the back of Jessica's mind.`
`......For some reason, she remembered being thrown somewhere, ......and that her head had been smashed by George's heel......`
`"Am I......alive......?"`
`"No, you are dead.`
` That is merely being postponed for a scant three minutes with my magic.`
` After three minutes, the magic will end, and you will return to being a tragic corpse with half of its head destroyed."`
`"Wha......t.........?`
` ......Heh, .........heheheheh......"`
`"Death is brutal.`
` In most cases, you aren't even given the time to ready your heart.`
` ......However, I have decided to give you that time, in recognition of your valiant battle.`
` Use those three minutes to ensure that your lingering attachments to this world are all taken care of."`
`"Or, ......I could use those three minutes to take you down with me......"`
`But the power that had been burning inside Jessica's body was now completely lost.`
`......Jessica was aware of that herself.`
` She was already dead.`
`"Well then, I will leave you now.`
` If you would excuse me.`
` ......It was fun, Jessica‐sama."`
`Ronove turned his form into a cloud of gold butterflies, and disappeared.`
`All that remained was the sound of the wind and rain, and the figure of Jessica, crouching down against the wall......`
`Jessica realized.`
` After three minutes, she probably really would revert to the corpse she had been.`
`......In those three minutes, was there anything she could do.........?`
`She stood up, and with a shaky gait,`
` ......took the phone that was on the desk...`
`"He‐......hello.`
` ......Is that you, Jessica?`
` Jessica?!`
` What is it, are you alright?!?!"`
`".........Heh, ......heheheheh...`
` ......They...got me......"`
`"Are you alright?!`
` Are you hurt?!`
` I'll come help you right now!!"`
`"Nah, ......it's too late.`
` ...I'm...already dead, apparently...`
` Ahahaha, by the time you get here, I'll be a corpse with half my head spilled out."`
`"God{i:damn} that old man!!`
` Wait right there, I'm coming right now!!"`
`"Listen, Battler!!!`
` Listen closely, alright...?`
` .........I know exactly why Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san were so awkward talking about the guys who killed the six in the dining hall."`
`".........Those guys, uh...`
`......they aren't...`
`{y:0:Human}{n:0:human}."`
`"Wh‐...whaat?!`
` What are you talking about........."`
`"What do you want me to say, man, I frigging saw it, okay?!!`
` Those guys, they warp, set up barriers, ahhaha, {i:all} of that crap, y'know...?`
` It's like some manga, some anime, ......seriously, we can't deal with that."`
`"......Ahhahhahhah......`
` ...It was never gonna happen, fighting them... It's impossible......`
` That hat‐stand spear you were so proud of, you'd need something way better than that to deal with these guys..."`
`A line of blood dripped down from Jessica's forehead......`
`"George nii‐san didn't make it either.`
` Instant death, that was...`
` .........Heheh, the next test is yours, Battler.`
` .........I wonder if your test will be the same as ours......`
` .........Be careful, ......and don't get it wrong."`
`"Y‐you mean the test...?"`
`"No.`
` .........Don't get it wrong and...`
`...think the enemy's obviously gotta be {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}."`
`".........The enemy...is not {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` ...They're demons......who can wield terrifying magic at will."`
`"No matter what, ......don't get that wrong......"`
`"*cough*, *cough*cough*!! Watch......yourself......"`
`A line of blood dripped down from Jessica's mouth as well.`
`......The left half of her head started hurting.`
`Jessica realized that she was about to return to the corpse she had been.`
`"...............When thirteen people die, the Golden Witch...revives.`
` Mom and the others killed earlier were the first six.`
` That's the first twilight.`
` ......And with George nii‐san and me dead, that's the second.`
` ......So if just five more people are killed, the ritual is gonna be complete, ......and the witch will revive."`
`".........I hope Dad and the rest are safe...`
` ......If they aren't,`
` .........the one to test you...`
`might be the newly resurrected {f:5:Beatrice} herself..."`
`By now, Battler had no idea what Jessica was saying.`
`{n}But from her tone, he realized that she knew she was about to die.`
`So even though he didn't understand the situation, he urged her to hang on in there.`
`"......Haha, I told you, I'm already dead.`
` .........See ya.`
` It looks like time's up.`
` ......Good luck on your test.`
` I hope you can...become the head.`
` ..........................."`
`"Jessica?`
` Jessica?!`
` Hey, answer me!!`
` Jessicaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`Battler's sorrowful voice could be heard from the dangling receiver.`
`......Crouching with her back against the adjacent wall...`
`{n}......Jessica's head was half smashed.........`
`"Where are we......?"`
`"...Is this...a well......?`
` Where is this...?"`
`Kyrie stuck her face out of the well, and then Krauss showed himself too.`
`{n}When he noticed that they could see the back of the mansion beyond a grove of trees, Krauss realized more or less where they were.`
`......To think that there had been a hidden underground passage in a well all the way out here,`
` and that it led to a hidden mansion......`
`"Th‐this really is tough on this old body......`
` ......Ordinarily, you can come up through a different place, with real stairs.`
` Provided you can unlock it..."`
`"......I have many questions I'd like to ask you about the layout of this place later, Doctor Nanjo.`
` ......Shannon, are you alright? Grab my hand."`
`"I, ......I'm okay.`
` Kanon‐kun, quickly."`
`Kanon was the last, climbing up the ladder towards them in the shaft disguised as a well.`
`{n}......It was probably quite deep.`
`When he looked down, for the first time, he realized how far he'd come up.`
`"Nihi. Firing."`
`Bang.`
`............As Kanon was about to finally crawl out of the well, a hole the size of a basketball opened up in his chest.`
`......Everyone there looked through the hole in Kanon's chest to the scenery beyond......`
`"K‐..........Kanon‐kun!!!"`
`"......Ne...`
`...e‐sa...`
`............"`
`Kanon toppled backwards,`
` ......and was swallowed up into the depths of the well......`
`"E‐everyone, run for it!!`
` The Chiester Sisters!!`
` They've locked on, we can't avoid them!!`
` Run!!`
` At least one of us survive...!!!"`
`At that time, Krauss, Kyrie, and Nanjo...`
`clearly saw a golden curve appear from the well,`
` ......and sew itself through the side of Shannon's head.........`
`"Shannon!!!"`
`Head pierced.`
` The three were perfect witnesses to everything, up to and including the opposite side of her head being blasted away into pulp.`
`Shannon fell to her knees,`
` .........blood gushing from both sides of her head,`
` and flopped to the ground.`
`"W‐waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhyaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"They're after us!!`
` Run!!`
` We'll be killed!!"`
`"...R‐run...run run run!!!"`
`Nanjo had become paralyzed in fright by the manner of Shannon's death, and the Chiester Sisters would not miss their chance.`
`A curve again appeared from the well, and pierced through Nanjo's forehead and out the back of his head in an instant, sewing through him.`
`......Thump.`
` And so Nanjo expired.`
`"What on Earth... Why...?!!`
` Where's the enemy attacking from?!"`
`"We're being sniped!!`
` I don't know where from, but they have us completely in their sights!!`
` Escape into the mansion, block their line of sight!!"`
`The two dashed into the back entrance of the mansion.`
`Then, the instant Krauss tried to shut the door behind him...`
`......a golden curve appeared for the fourth time, piercing Krauss from the back of his head out through his forehead, and smashing even his forehead to pieces...`
`"............nngg...`
`.........oohh............"`
`"Eeek!!`
` Hiyiiiiiiii!!!"`
`Krauss's body lurched over, fell down hard, and drew a neat radial pattern with the insides of his head...`
`Kyrie ran wildly through the hallway, flew into some room, and locked the door.`
`.........But she couldn't imagine for a moment that this would save her life.`
`She would probably die soon!`
`This was apparently one of the guest rooms.`
`{n}......At that moment, a phone on a side table caught Kyrie's eye...`
`After hanging up the call from Jessica, Battler was literally just about to dash out.`
`In that instant, the phone rang again.`
`"H‐hello!!!`
` ...............Huh?`
` Kyrie‐san?!"`
`"......Yes, Battler‐kun.`
` ......I got lucky.`
` I managed to escape the dungeon somehow.`
` I really was fortunate."`
`"Where are you?!`
` Is everyone alright?!`
` On our side, it looks like Jessica and George‐aniki are—"`
`"Listen!!!`
` I probably won't be alive for long."`
`Then, right after she got the sudden feeling that the keyhole of the locked door might have glowed gold,`
` a gold, curved line drawing a helix...`
`...no, a golden sewing thread...infiltrated the room through there at an incredible speed, and bored a hole into the floor by Kyrie's feet.`
`......Oh, that's rare.`
`The enemy, who had sniped the other four one after another with extraordinary skill,`
` apparently really does have trouble shooting me between the eyes with a single shot while I'm holed up in this room.`
`But the next strike will probably hit......`
`At this point, Kyrie finally remembered the initial massacre in the dining hall......`
`......That's right......`
` ......This is what killed Rudolf and the rest, all six of them......`
`"......Listen, Battler‐kun.`
` I'm going to tell you everything exactly as I saw it.`
` ...I'm sure you'll think that something's gone wrong with my head."`
`"......In fact, it's alright for you to think that.`
` Even I still haven't come to terms with what it was I saw."`
`".........Today,`
` after you all returned to the guesthouse, the family conference began in the dining hall,`
` ......and I'll tell you everything that happened next."`
`"Listen until the end without butting in.`
` ............The call might suddenly be cut off partway through.`
` If it is, that's the moment I was killed."`
`".........Kyrie......san......"`
`Then, Kyrie spoke...`
`......about how Kinzo had come, the family conference had started,`
` ......the six had been killed, and the five of them had been confined.`
`......About how she had escaped somehow, and made it to where she was now,`
` and how everyone had finally been killed—all spoken dispassionately, as she had seen it, with no dramatization.`
`......She even spoke about how everyone except her had been killed, and how she had observed the moments of all their deaths,`
` ......and how, even this very moment, someone was trying to kill her.`
`"............Actually,`
` even while we've been talking, ...I've been attacked three times.`
` Something like a strange gold thread keeps flying in through the keyhole, spinning around and aiming for me."`
`"First it was by my feet.`
` ......Next, it was close to my shoulders.`
` ......Just now, it grazed my ear.`
` ......Its aim is getting more and more accurate.`
` Looks like it'll go right between my eyes pretty soon......"`
`"R‐run, Kyrie‐san...!!`
` Run awaaaaaaaaaaay!!!"`
`"Where to?`
` ......You realize,`
` ...I've managed to run all the way here,`
` ......shut myself into a room, and even locked the door......?`
` .........And I'm still being targeted.`
` .........Just where am I meant to hide...?`
` ......Seriously......"`
`"Ky......`
`ri...`
`e...`
`...san........."`
`"Battler‐kun...`
` Are Jessica‐chan and George‐kun......still alive?"`
`".....................`
` ......Just now, ...there was a phone call from Jessica...`
` .........It kinda......sounded like they were...done for......"`
`".........Thought so.`
` ......Yeah, when we five were being killed one after another, I had a kind of premonition.`
` ......I thought that perhaps the second twilight had been finished in the thirteen‐person murder ritual, and that our twilights had been reached."`
`".........In other words, when I die, that's thirteen.`
` Then the ritual will be complete.`
` ......The Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, will be resurrected."`
`".........I wonder what will happen.`
` ......On this island filled with demons and witches, and swarming with goat monsters,`
` ......when even the boss of them all, the Golden Witch, appears,`
` .........I wonder just what in the world will happen...`
` ......At this point,`
` I can't...`
`......make any sense of anything anymore."`
`Kyrie‐san's voice......had given up, completely, on her own life.`
`And because Battler could tell that,`
` ......he couldn't stop the tears......`
`"......I did have just one thing...I can advise you on."`
`"What...?"`
`".........Even if...`
`a demon or a witch does appear in front of you..."`
`"Yeah..."`
`"There's no need whatsoever to doubt what they are.`
` ......Understand that they are what they seem."`
`"........................"`
`"You might think that there should be some trick, or that there's some true identity behind it.`
` ......If you have the time to think of something like that,`
` ......it would be much more constructive to think of how not to damage the mood of whatever you're facing."`
`"......Even mistakenly, ...you must not say "Prove it then, show me some magic"...`
` ......They will probably use a method of utmost cruelty...`
`...to show you the proof."`
`"......I can't...`
`...believe it......`
` ......I never thought...`
`...I'd hear something like that coming from your mouth...`
` ......I can't believe it........."`
`"I understand.`
` That it's unbelievable.`
` ......That's why...that's the only advice I can give to you.`
` ......{i:Believe}."`
`".........You're telling me to believe in {f:5:Beatrice}...and demons and witches and monsters......?"`
`"Probably,`
` ......even after being so clearly shown all those things not of this world,`
` ......we still weren't able to believe any of it, I think."`
`"......I'm like that even now.`
` ......The true form of this thing that keeps attacking me, trying to shoot through my forehead,`
` ......is something I can't understand,`
` .........and I can't believe."`
`"So,`
` ......I want you at least to believe, to understand,`
` .........and to accept that being which...`
`...we couldn't fully accept.`
` If you do that for me, our deaths won't have been in vain.`
` .........It'll also have been worth it for me to make this phone call...`
` ......Ah...!"`
`"K‐Kyrie‐san?!?!"`
`"......I'm still okay.`
` It grazed me, but it missed again.`
` ......I very much doubt...`
`.........that I'll survive the next one.`
` .........Thank you.`
` And goodbye, Battler‐kun.`
` ......I was once cold towards you because you were Asumu‐san's son.`
` ......Forgive me...for those days."`
`"What do you mean, {i:forgive} you? Kyrie‐san, you are a {i:mother} to me now!!"`
`I felt as though I heard an incredible sound at the other end of the receiver.`
`{n}And then, a noisy clattering sound.`
`......As though the receiver had fallen to the floor.`
`"Kyrie‐san?!?!`
` Kyrie‐san!!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!"`
`.........Kyrie‐san never...`
`......responded through the phone...`
`.........again.........`
`"......I don't know why you're angry, Battler."`
`"You {i:should?!}`
` Everyone was killed, goddammit!!`
` By that goddamned old fart!`
` Saying something incomprehensible about {f:5:Beatrice}'s resurrection ritual or something!!"`
`"Then, that means, thirteen people have been offered as sacrifices,`
` ......and {f:5:Beatrice} will have revived already, you know?"`
`"Yeah, that's perfect!!`
` I'll take {f:5:Beatrice} too and kill them both!!"`
`"............We survived the ritual.`
` So we'll receive an invitation to the Golden Land from {f:5:Beatrice}, you see......?"`
`"All wishes are granted there.`
` If you're suffering because your family was killed, then you just have to bring them back to life.`
` ......That's what I plan to do.`
` I'm going to revive my really nice real mama, the one that isn't possessed by the black witch."`
`"......So Mama will always be with me from now on.`
` .........There won't be any more overtime or working on days off.`
` ...She'll always be with me, and think only of me, kihhihihi, and she'll fight all the time against fearsome enemies for me.`
` Kihhihi{0}hi{0}hihihi...!"`
`"......There's something wrong with you.`
` ......How can you sit there saying such incomprehensible crap in a situation like this...?!"`
`"............Didn't Auntie Kyrie just tell you, Battler...?`
` ......Didn't she tell you...`
`to believe...`
`...in the witch?"`
`".....................Sh‐shit.`
` This isn't the time to get in an argument with you...!!`
` Forget "hostages", at this point, there's no one left alive at all!`
` This dumb‐as‐hell, screwed‐up ritual game is done now...!!"`
`"From here on, I'm doing what {i:I} want.`
` Someone might still be alive.`
` Or someone might be hiding!`
` I'll search every nook and cranny of this place, find them, and beat the shit out of them!!"`
`In a rage, Battler grabbed his hat‐stand spear and flew out of the room.`
`Maria watched him go, looking bored...`
`".........But {f:5:Beatrice} would grant your wishes soon anyway.`
` ......Stupid Battler.`
` ......Kihhihihihi."`
`Then, the phone rang out again......`
`Maria stood up, and grabbed the receiver.`
`"Uu.`
` Hello.`
` ......Uu?`
` Uu!!!"`
`Of course, the sound of the phone also reached Battler's ears as he was about to dash out of the guesthouse.`
`With a violent forcefulness, he turned around and dashed into the cousins' room...`
`"M‐Maria......!`
` The phone call, ......who's it from...?!"`
`With a terrifying look on his face, Battler yelled at Maria, who was on the phone.`
`You couldn't blame him......`
` Right now, the only humans left alive on the island were himself, Maria, Gohda, and Kumasawa.`
`But there was no way those two could call when they were locked up in the gardening storehouse.`
`......Which meant.........there was only one person.`
`{n}It had to be Kinzo.`
`As she happily chatted with the person on the other end of the phone, Maria slowly turned to face Battler.`
`.........And, with an unsettling expression on her face, she laughed with a "kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi".`
`{n}......It felt almost as though the person on the other end of the line was chatting about Battler.`
`"Maria...who's on the phone?`
` ......Grandfather......?!"`
`Battler couldn't imagine that this was the case.`
`...After all, it was inconceivable that Maria would be having such a friendly talk with Kinzo,`
` ......chatting to him about Battler with that eerie smile on her face.`
`Just what kind of person could be on the phone.........who could make Maria chat with a smile like that?`
`.........At that time, in the back of his mind, the words Kyrie had spoken to him drifted up.`
`Even if a witch does appear, there is no need to doubt it.`
`{n}......Just.........believe in its existence......`
`"Yep.`
` Battler just came back.`
` He sure is hasty.`
` Kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi......"`
`"Maria!!`
` Who's on the phone?!`
` Who?!?!"`
`"......Hand it over?`
` Sure.`
` ............Here, Battler."`
`After getting the consent of the person on the other end, she held the receiver out to Battler...`
`"..................uh."`
`"Here."`
`Maria held the receiver out for him to take, ......as though it was perfectly normal.`
`Battler felt just a little bit of hesitation towards taking the receiver.`
`......Because, .........by acknowledging the existence of the person at the other end,`
` .........he would have no choice but to admit it.`
`.........Kyrie had said it.`
`......There is no longer...`
`...any need...`
`...to doubt their existence...`
`Battler took the receiver.`
`After he did so, Maria briskly headed for the door.`
`Battler, who was slightly fearful about finding out for sure who was at the other end of the receiver,`
` questioned Maria before taking the call.`
`"H‐hey!`
` Where are you going...?!"`
`"To where my test is.`
` ......I wonder who the Ushiromiya family head will be, you or me.`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi."`
`".........D‐don't go!!`
` You'll be killed!!"`
`"No I won't.`
` The ritual's already over.`
` ...And even if I am, I'll be revived.`
` ......Whether one of us becomes the head or not, we're already invited to the Golden Land.`
` See you."`
`"Wait!!`
` Maria...!!!"`
`Battler stretched his hand out to Maria's back as she left,`
` ......but the cord of the receiver that he was gripping held him back like a chain.`
`......He readied himself.`
` ...Battler put the receiver to his ear......`
`"...............He‐......hello......?"`
`"<Congratulaatioooooooons>!!`
` <And I'm fi~ne>!!`
` <And yoo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oouuuuu>?!`
` Aaa{0}a{0}ah{0}h{0}h{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyaaaaa!!!"`
`Screwed up, mocking English filled his ears.`
`{n}......It was the voice of a woman he didn't know.`
`......Who—`
`the inside of his head was starting to freeze up—`
`............who............`
`"What do you mean "who", Ushiromiya Battleeeeer...?`
` The answer, normally, is <ye~s, I'm fine>!`
` Is it not??`
` That takes me back...you must have done that one in middle school, right?`
` That thing you do in pairs!`
` Uhhya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hyaaaaahh!!!"`
`"Y‐...you're insane......`
` Who are you?!!`
` Answer me!!!"`
`"Say it in Engliiish.`
` Isn't that your specialtyyyyy?"`
`"......Qui‐quit messing with me......`
` Who are you?!!`
` That crazy old bastard's underling?!"`
`"‘Underling’ is a cruel description.`
` Go the other way and try "captive".`
` ......I have Kinzo captive!`
` Ri~~ght?`
` Wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha..."`
`That last laugh didn't sound like it was aimed at Battler.`
`......It was almost as though Kinzo was right next to the phone, cackling as well...`
`"......S‐......say your goddamned name!!`
` Who are you?!`
` Who?!!!"`
`"Try and guess, you could win a invite to Hawaii!`
` Ahhyah{0}hyah{0}hhyaaaah!!`
` Fffinally.`
` FINALLY!!`
` Mmmmmmm, it was soooo looo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ong, the days leading up to today were reee{-}e{-}eeally long...!!"`
`"I seriously waited a thousand years, you know?? For this day to arrive!!`
` And here it is, all thanks to you,`
` my BIG resurrection!!`
` <Thank you>, Kinzo!`
` Just this once,`
` I'll let you have that last takeback of yo~urs!!!"`
`"......Hell's bells, do you have to be in this much of a good mood?`
` Can't you act a little more ladylike?"`
`Kinzo and {f:5:Beatrice} sat facing each other over the chessboard on the reception table.`
`Also on the table were expensive cheeses and the like to go with drinks.`
`{n}And there was a line of several empty wine bottles.`
`As {f:5:Beatrice} rolled around in her sofa in an unseemly way,`
` she held a wine glass in one hand, in a good mood,`
` ......and probably, completely drunk.`
`"I'm in the {i:best} mood today, so I'm feeling crazy generous!!`
` Hey, hey, Kinzo, don't use a well‐aged noble rot wine like this as a decoration!`
` Hooooly shit, it's a 1947?!"`
`"If you don't open it today, just when are you gonna open it?!`
` Let's slosh it all over each other for fun!`
` Then let's whack each other with the empty bottle!`
` Uhhyah{0}hyah{0}hyahhya!!"`
`"Hahhaha, that would be entertaining.`
` You are a little too excited.`
` You're cutting loose too much."`
`"And what about youuuuuu?!`
` Aren't you happy to be reunited with meee?`
` Aaah, it's the living world! The earthly world!!`
` Long live my flesh!!"`
`"......What......are you going on about.........?`
` ...Are you saying that you're......B‐{f:5:Beatrice} or something...?"`
`"<Ye~eeeeeeeeeeeeeeess, I aaaaaaaaaamm>!!`
` Thanks to Kinzo's thirteen‐person murder ritual, I've finally been resurrected...!!`
` It's nice having a mouth, it's nice having a tongue!`
` How fun it is to be able to talk to you like this!"`
`"Come to think of it, even though we've hurled insults at each other over and over again,`
` this is the first time we've had a conversation like this on the board during the game, isn't it?`
` How very fresh!!"`
`"Oh, did you hear that pop sound?!`
` He {i:opened} it, the maniac actually went and opened that vintage wine that's expensive as shit!!`
` Do you know how much a single bottle of that stuff {i:costs}?!`
` As much as a whole ten‐kilogram ingot, isn't that craaaaaazy?!?!`
` Hiiiii‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"`
`"C‐cut the crap...!!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} my ass...!!`
` You say you're the Golden Witch?!`
` That's enough!!"`
`"Where the hell are you?!`
` Is that damn old fart with you as well?!`
` I'll beat the shit out of both of you!!`
` Where are you right now?!`
` Answer me!!"`
`"Ohhh, so you want to meeeet me?`
` Uhhihihihi, sure is tough being a popular woman!`
` But please, don't try to chat me up when Kinzo's around, okaay?`
` The guy's a bad egg, he gets seriously jealous, see?"`
`".........But when Kinzo isn't around and we're all alone, I'll love you all you want in secret, alright...?`
` Uhyaaahya{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}kkya{0}kkya{0}kkyakkya!!!"`
`"Y‐you're insane........."`
`"Kinzoo, I've changed my mind.`
` I won't do Maria's test.`
` You go."`
`"How fickle.`
` Then you are saying that you will do Battler's test?"`
`"Nothing wrong with that, ri~ght?!`
` That guy's so much like a younger you, y'know? It makes my heart race."`
`"Don't worry, I'm not gonna cheat on yooooou.`
` I'll only be alone with him this one time.`
` ......I'm always alone with you, riiight...?`
` But no more tying me up twenty‐four hours a day, alright?`
` Kuhhyahha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!!"`
`"So there you have it, Battlerr!`
` I, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}, will be running your test myself!`
` As for the place...let me see.`
` At the front entrance to this mansion!"`
`"Battlerr, this headship test, you've seriously gotta full‐ass this one, okaay?`
` ......I mean, Kinzo's practically dead on his feet.`
` If you become the next head, you'll be the new owner of everything on this island."`
`"......I wouldn't mind letting you have me all to yourself, you know......?`
` Just like Kinzo did, ......control me, okay......?`
` Kuhhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi, uhhya{0}hha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!"`
`"Th‐the front entrance of the mansion......`
` Perfect...!!`
` Listen to me, you stinking drunk!!`
` I'll sober you up.`
` And I've got some {i:hot punch} waiting to help you through your hangover!!`
` Just you wait!!"`
`Battler impulsively slammed the receiver down.`
`{n}There was no need to talk through a receiver anymore.`
`......I'll meet her face to face and settle this!!`
`I took the spear I'd made by taking apart the hat stand,`
` and went outside without even an umbrella.`
`......It's hard to imagine that the young woman calling herself {f:5:Beatrice} will be waiting for me alone.`
`...I should probably assume that she'll be waiting with those supporting troops that Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san told us about.`
`Going alone would be too reckless...`
`"Gohda‐san, Kumasawa‐san...!`
` It's me, it's Battler...!"`
`I headed for the gardening storehouse first.`
`{n}I need all the help I can get.`
`Gohda‐san's a burly man, so I can probably count on him to add some extra brawn.`
`{n}Kumasawa‐san's knowledge and familiarity with the area as a senior servant might prove to be a huge weapon.`
`Both of them have master keys, and they know more about the mansion than I do.`
` ......They're pretty reliable allies.`
`As I banged on the shutter and called out for them to open it, I remembered that there was nothing they could do from the inside.`
`I would have to get the key back from them and open the shutter myself.`
`I went around to the side, knocked on the small latticed window there, and opened it up.`
`"Gohda‐san, Kumasawa baa‐chan...!`
` It's Battler...!!`
` Hey, come on, get up...............h...ey........."`
`The scene in the shed, lit by a dim lightbulb, .........was all too......bizarre......`
`"......Gohda...`
`sa...n......`
` ......Kumasawa......sa...`
`......n........."`
`From a low ceiling beam...`
`......hung two thick ropes,`
` ......and at the ends,`
` ......Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san...`
`.........were hanging...by their necks.....`
`It was dim, and I was looking through a narrow gap between all the various pieces of equipment strewn about, so I couldn't make out any more detail than that.`
`......But when they showed not even a tremor after I called out to them,`
` and because of the way the loops around their necks seemed to carry the full weight of their bodies, I could sense no trace of life from them......`
`"You've got to be............kidding me......right............?`
` ......Why........."`
`The shutter is still closed.`
`......And there's only a single key, which I'm sure Gohda‐san took possession of.`
`So how did the culprit......open the shutter and kill the two of them inside......?`
`No wait, they weren't necessarily killed...`
`{n}If this is a suicide......`
`......That way, this locked room makes sense, but I don't know why the two of them would hang themselves...!!`
`Feebly, ...I slumped down on the spot.`
`Now, the only humans alive on this island...`
`...are me, Maria,`
` ......and my old bastard's old bastard.`
`.........No, there's also that nutso woman calling herself {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`Maria's been acting like she's on the witch's side from the beginning.`
`{n}And Gramps is the very person who revived the witch.`
`{n}Plus there's the witch herself.`
`......What the hell... .........Then, it's just as though...`
`.........I'm the only one on this island............`
`Using my pole as a cane, I feebly rose to my feet.`
`......Damn, I can't do it like this...`
`{n}I've got to avenge...everyone......`
`"Damn iiiiiiiit...... This is no good...`
` Yeah, it's no good, it's no goddamn good at all...`
` Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiitt........."`
`I got the crying out of the way while I could...`
` So that all my weak emotions would be squeezed out with my tears...`
`Then, ......I straightened up, and gazed into the darkness in the direction of the mansion.`
`.........At the entrance to the mansion, the witch is waiting.`
`I'll go, ......and settle this.`
`I'll find the source of this weird, blood‐soaked night, ......and crush her with my own hands...!`
`Amidst the pouring rain, ......I walked through the rose garden without an umbrella, letting myself get soaked.`
`......I could see the arbor in the distance.`
`According to Jessica, it seemed that George‐aniki had also been killed...`
`Well, by this point, there's no need to worry about the lives of any hostages.`
`{n}......I left the path, aiming for the arbor.`
`Then,`
` ............I saw George‐aniki's weather‐beaten corpse...`
`"...............Aniki......`
` ............Shit............"`
`The corpse was in front of the arbor.`
`If he could have died under the arbor, he would at least have been spared being beaten down upon by the rain...`
`There was a gaping hole in Aniki's forehead, as though he had been shot with a gun.`
`Perhaps because the rain had washed everything away, his face wasn't covered with blood, ......and so he looked almost like he was sleeping.`
`...However, the deep red his clothes were stained still provided the evidence that a large amount of blood had flowed out...`
`How happy I'd be if he were sleeping, or else pretending to be dead...`
`......But Aniki's eyes remained open, even though the rain sprayed against them.`
`......And......the hole in his forehead was, without a hint of a joke,`
` ......the real thing...`
`There had been a faint chance...`
`that Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san hanging by their necks in the gardening shed could have been a bad joke.`
`But that naive possibility had now been completely denied.`
`And, as I looked at this corpse, I became completely sure.`
`Just as Gohda‐san had once said.`
` ......The enemy came to take lives as though these lives were pieces on a chess board.`
`".........Yeah, ......there's no mistake.`
` ......It seems that old geezer and the witch...`
`......really don't view our lives as anything more than that......"`
`...That damn witch, when she was on the phone...`
`{n}She talked about us like we were "on the game board"......`
`"...Perfect......`
` ......Right, she thinks this is a game, huh......`
` Then, ...in the same way you killed everyone like it was a game,`
` .........it's alright if I kill all of you like it's a game as well, right......?"`
`"............Just you wait......`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice}........."`
`The lightning caused the mansion's vast shadow to emerge.`
`......Finally, ......the mansion.`
`As the massive shape came into view, there was no silhouette of any person.`
`{n}It seemed that there weren't any underlings waiting for me in a pack, or anything like that.`
`.........According to Kyrie‐san, there were a large number of attendants with goat heads.`
`At least for now, I couldn't sense...`
`any large group like that hiding and staring at me...`
`What's this......?`
`{n}Beneath the roof of the entrance,`
` .........there's something set down.`
`"......What is this?`
` .........A...box?"`
`It looked like the kind of small box that girls often keep trinkets in.`
`......Or maybe it was the same kind of extravagant cigar case you'd find in a reception room.`
`Either way, it didn't look like something that belonged here...`
`{n}It clearly looked......as though I was being told to open it.`
`But the thought of doing what they wanted me to do was somehow irritating.`
`{n}......However, it didn't look like we'd get anywhere if I didn't open it.`
`Could it be that it's set up with some trap to make it explode when opened......?`
`While thinking things like that, and forgetting even to go under the overhang,`
` I continued to glare at the box as the rain beat down upon me.`
`Then, .........mixed in with the thunder, was some kind of......music?`
` ...It sounded like something like that.`
`......It was the tone of the big clock in the hall announcing midnight.`
`It was also the sound that announced that the crazy day of October 4th had finally ended,`
` ......and that the much more incredibly crazy day of October 5th had begun.`
`That sound quietened, ............and I could hear an eerie laugh coming out of nowhere......`
`I got the feeling that the voice was coming from the heavens, ......and I looked up at the sky.`
`......And there.........was a woman I had never seen before.`
`{n}No, it's not true that I've never seen her before.`
`{n}......I saw her once today.`
`Yes, in the portrait inside the mansion......`
`The clothes were different, ......but that face was just like the witch of the portrait......`
`Aaah, who am I kidding... I already know who this person is...!!`
`"......S‐......so you are {f:5:Beatrice}!!!"`
`"Yooohooooooooo, Battleeeeeeeeeeeeer...!!"`
`Leaning over the second floor balcony, ......and waving cheerily from under her umbrella,`
` ......was, without a doubt, ......the witch of the portrait, ...{f:5:Beatrice}.........!!`
`Was the plan for the boss to watch on from above as her goat underlings torture me to death...?!`
`I adjusted my grip on the spear,`
` and, imagining goats creeping out of the surrounding shadows and the entrance and surrounding me, I raised my guard in all directions...`
`"Ahhaha, be at ease, there's no one here but you and me, see?`
` There is no goat furniture, there are no demon butlers; Master is not here, nor my close demon friend."`
`"And there are none of the gold butterflies that help compose my physical form, there are no magic circles, and no summoners in attendance!!`
` ......Do you know what this means?"`
`"Not a clue.`
` Quit babbling..."`
`"I have in fact met you several times even in this world.`
` Almost as though brushing past one another, meeting only for a moment.`
` ......As you know, this world of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s is filled with a toxin just by your existence and your doubting of me."`
`"Almost like solid ramparts strengthening the defense around you, the king!`
` And through multiple games,`
` I advanced my pieces one by one, splitting you apart, and cornering you, undermining your ramparts bit by bit."`
`"Then, finally, once I opened a tiny crack, I sent a bishop in, so that it could approach right up next to you.`
` .........But as you know, bishops are pieces with blind spots."`
`"As long as you stay on the black squares, a black bishop can exert massive influence upon you,`
` but if you escape just one step to a white square, then even if I close in right next to you, I will not be able to touch you."`
`"That is why I have progressed through these games by sending in various pieces so that you cannot stay on a white square,`
` forcing you out in front of me, the one who controls the black squares next to you."`
`"Howeeever!!"`
`"There are now holes opened all over your ramparts,`
` and I was at last able to send in, not a bishop, but a full queen!!`
` Do you know what kind of piece a queen is?"`
`"A rook plus a bishop.`
` ......Is this what you're trying to say?`
` ...Now, you not only control the black squares that are the witch illusions, but have also become able to encroach upon the white squares of the human world at will...?!"`
`"That is correct!!`
` Where there exist the gold butterflies that are my minions, you have been labeling those squares as witch illusions,`
` denying them under the hypothesis that they are observerless nonreality, am I right...?`
` *cackle*cackle*, I am well aware......!!"`
`"For that very reason, I have at last descended thus upon the squares of white!!`
` Worry not, I'll call plenty of gold butterflies, goats, demons, and witches later on!`
` If you wish, I will invite you to my Golden Land!!"`
`"There, I will grant you any wish that you desire...!!`
` Wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!"`
`"......It's starting to look like someone knocked an ink bottle over the chessboard of this island."`
`"I see, that too is a pleasant description...!`
` *cackle*cackle*, soon, you will be covered in that ink as well.`
` Before long, you will become dyed pitch‐black, and surely become a black king...!`
` At this point, you are a pitiful existence drowning in a sea of ink, are you not?"`
`"No, I'm not.`
` I'll admit that the island has been stained completely black from your ink bottle,`
` ......but there's still a white square left."`
`"Hoh, and where...?!!"`
`"Right under my feet.`
` .........Your magic ink may try to cover the entire island, but it can't cover the ground my feet are standing on.`
` ...Even if this island seems to be stained pitch‐black at a glance, I am me.`
` I am here, with my feet firmly planted on a white square!!"`
`It's strange...`
` Until a second ago, I was trembling all over.`
`......But now that she's appeared openly right before my eyes like this, my terror has actually lessened.`
`It's funny.`
` Ghosts are most terrifying when you can only sense them.`
`When you can see them, and they have a face you can plant your fist into, there's nothing scary about it...!!`
`......However, she is definitely not a funny or a friendly person.`
`......She can kill me instantly while rolling around giggling, just by snapping a finger.`
`Whether we interpret the result of her snapping her fingers as magic flying at me or underlings showing up to shoot me, it doesn't matter.`
`......In any case, whether this is fantasy or mystery,`
` that queen is in a position where she can kill me just by snapping her fingers......!`
`...I see, ......so this is the meaning...`
`......of the queen of this island,`
` ...who reigns over both the white and black squares......?!`
`"Now then.`
` It might be interesting to wait until you catch a cold in all that rain, but it's about time to move to the matter at hand.`
` .........I am sure that you can tell there is a box there?`
` Your test is inside of it."`
`"Hold it.`
` ......After all that's happened, I'm not interested in some stupid game about who'll be the next head."`
`"My game is to take you and the old man, ......and all the rest of you guys who killed everyone, and give every one of you a full‐on punch to the face."`
`"Hoh.`
` So you will fly through the sky up to my balcony?`
` Very good, very good, *cackle*!`
` Come on then, up you come already, come on come on, up up!"`
`"......Damn you, acting like you're hot shit just 'cause you're in a completely safe place...`
` I'm coming up there right now, so you better be prepared!!"`
`"Aah, no, no, no.`
` It's all locked up.`
` Of course, the shutters are down for all the windows as well.`
` My castle isn't so fragile that a single knight like you could break in!"`
`I tried the front door anyway just in case, ......but, yup, it really was locked.`
`{n}When I looked around, I noticed that indeed the shutters were closed on the windows.`
`......Normally, they wouldn't be.`
`"......Tch.`
` Looks like you prepare for everything.`
` ......Where's the key?!"`
`Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san probably have master keys, but they're in the locked room of the gardening storehouse.`
`......I can only give up for now...!`
`"Damn......`
` ......Guess she's no fool herself."`
`"Are you really so dying to be right by my siiiide?`
` Alright, if you pass your test with flying colors, why don't I grant you an audience?`
` If you pass, then you will be the successor, and my new master after Kinzo."`
`"......My body and soul will be yours to do with as you will.`
` Because I am ultimately the Ushiromiya family's furniture!`
` Ah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"`
`"............Well,`
` it looks like you want to make me take this test no matter what.`
` ......Alright.`
` I'm game.`
` ...If I pass, my first prize will be a punch to your face."`
`"Scary, scaary...`
` But it's not like I mind being controlled by violence, you see?`
` {i:Grab}...onto my head!`
` Make my face twist in pain, violate me in the same way a hawk tears apart and scratches at its prey with its talons...!!"`
`"Aaah, remind me of Kinzo in his younger days once more...!!`
` That single time in my thousand‐year life!`
` Remind me of that day I was taught the joy of being controlled, of submitting and being reduced to furnituuuuuuuure!!`
` Uhyaaa{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}hhya!!"`
`"......You damn drunk, we aren't getting anywhere."`
`Ignoring the stupidly smiling witch, I picked up the box.`
`"Yes.`
` Open it.`
` Inside is a letter.`
` Read it."`
`"........................"`
`I opened it.`
` ......There was a faint smell of cigarettes.`
`{n}Apparently, it really had originally been a cigar case.`
`{n}But there were no cigarettes or cigars inside.`
`Instead, there was a Western envelope with the One‐winged Eagle crest.`
`{n}And when I opened that too, ......there was a letter inside.`
`I looked up at the witch.`
` She was grinning down at me.`
`......It seemed she was waiting in anticipation to see what kind of reaction I'd have to the contents.`
`......Dammit, I'll show her.`
` Its contents were like this...`
`{a:c:{e:070:Among the three mentioned below.`
`{n}In order to gain two, sacrifice one.`
`{n}{n}1. Your life`
`{n}2. __'s life`
`{n}3. Everyone else's lives`
`{n}{n}If you do not choose one, all of the above will be lost.}}`
`".........The heck is this?`
` Some pretty creepy stuff's written here.`
` And most importantly, the second one is blank, so I don't even know whose life."`
`"Mm.`
` That second one is where you put the name of the one that person loves the most.`
` For Jessica's test, it was Kanon's name, and for George's test it was Shannon's name."`
`"......Since they had obvious feelings for certain people, I was able to write those names in beforehand,`
` but I don't know who you have feelings for.`
` So I didn't know whose name to write, and left it blank."`
`"That's perfect.`
` I love you, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I'll stick your name in here.`
` So my choice is going to be number two.`
` Is that alright?"`
`"Hey, hey, quit joking, quit joking.`
` Come onnn, please, Battler.`
` Tell me the name of the person you have feelings for.`
` If you don't, then this won't be a test, right?"`
`"Too bad.`
` I don't have any woman in particular.`
` Even if I did, why the hell would I tell you?"`
`"In that case, this test will not work for you.`
` Hmmm, what a shame, what a shame.`
` And I was really wondering what kind of woman was your cup of tea!`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`".........What if I said I like young, flat‐chested girls with long, black hair.`
` You don't match in a single area, do you?"`
`"Lies, you breast sommelier!`
` You prefer a blonde bombshell with a <dynamite body>, don't you?!`
` I am precisely the embodiment of your ideal, *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"If guessing your three sizes is the test to become the successor, I'll take it gladly."`
`"Ah, yes.`
` This was the test to choose the successor.`
` Chatting with you is so much fun that I've been getting a bit off topic."`
`"......Then let us begin the headship test.`
` I will question you to see whether you are qualified to be the next Ushiromiya family head.`
` Answer with care."`
`The witch, who had been joking around like she was drunk until a second ago, suddenly regained her gravitas.`
`......She looked as though she truly had stepped out of that imposing portrait...`
`".........I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, the Golden Witch and the Endless Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......Do you have the qualifications to inherit the Ushiromiya family headship and all of my gold—`
`that is what I will test.`
` .........State your name."`
`"............Ushiromiya...Battler."`
`Under that majestic gaze, unimaginable from her manner a short while ago,`
` I answered without any hesitation.`
`......She truly was......yes, indeed,`
` ......in the truest sense, she was that worthy of calling herself the queen of this island.`
`"Very good, Ushiromiya Battler.`
` .........However, you have thrown away that Ushiromiya name for the past six years, have you not...?`
` Why is that...?"`
`".........mgh............`
` ......Because I'd had enough of my dad, the old bastard."`
`"I know.`
` It was because you felt your father's remarriage disgraced the death of your mother, whom you loved and respected, yes...?"`
`"I see, you have no blood relation to your new mother whatsoever.`
` It is not as though I cannot understand why you would feel unable to accept that mother.`
` ......However, no matter who your father remarries with, that does not change the fact that his blood runs in your veins, correct?"`
`".........What's your point?"`
`"I can, to an extent, understand the childishness which led you to oppose your father's remarriage out of a desire to have him all to yourself."`
`"However, was throwing away the Ushiromiya name as a means of resistance not a disgrace to your family and blood?"`
`".........You were born and raised Ushiromiya, were you not?`
` Do you think you were qualified to forget that debt and throw away the Ushiromiya name?"`
`"......It has nothing to do with you.`
` This is between me and Dad...!"`
`"The Ushiromiya name does not belong to you and your father alone.`
` You are a child who simply rebelled, unable to forgive the fact that your father was to be stolen away by an unknown woman.`
` ......Those six years during which you forsook the Ushiromiya register were a significantly long period where you dragged the Ushiromiya name through the mud.`
` Know the depths of your sinfulness."`
`"..................Well, sorry I'm so childish..."`
`"However.`
` Even though it was prompted by the deaths of your grandparents, I do commend you for returning to the Ushiromiya register.`
` Accordingly, I shall give you a chance to purify yourself of that sin.`
` Now is the time to atone for your sin of six years ago."`
`"Come, try to remember, remember your own sin.`
` Remember it, confess, and repent.`
` ............That shall be my test for you."`
`......At that moment, a massive thunderclap rang out, making my mind go blank.`
`"..............................`
` ......Repent? ...What?`
` .........Are you trying to tell me to apologize?"`
`".........The test has already begun.`
` You may think as you wish."`
`There were no signs from the witch's expression that she was sneering at a person unable to answer the tough question thrust upon them.`
`{n}......She was earnestly asking something of him, and he could even feel a quiet determination.`
`Even as the rain beat upon him, Battler could not shift his eyes from her gaze.`
`......The witch threw her umbrella away.`
`{n}She abandoned herself to the falling rain.`
`So that the rain would fall on her until Battler answered that question.`
`......She had chosen to join him, allowing the rain to beat down on her as well, until he reached an answer.`
`For some reason, Battler could tell that.`
`{n}......But, even so, ......he didn't understand.`
`"W‐......well, ...uh.`
` ......I mean, you're right, I do think I was being childish...`
` All things considered, just 'cause Dad got remarried, that doesn't wipe out what I owe him for raising me."`
`"......I hear Dad always kept on sending money over for my living expenses,`
` ......and he even said he wanted to be involved in my school events.`
` .........The only reason he couldn't come is......I told Grandma and Grandpa not to let him come no matter what......"`
`"......................................."`
`"......A‐and yeah, ......if you want to just be blunt and say I was being childish and rebellious, I can't argue with that.`
` .........But you know, ...in that case,`
` ......Mom, ......Ushiromiya Asumu, who's gonna set things right for her...?!`
` Mom was so devoted to our family, and did the very best she could...!"`
`"But Dad was cheating with Kyrie‐san.`
` He even got her pregnant with Ange...!`
` And then the moment she was born, he rushed them both into his register."`
`"......What is that if not a betrayal of Mom?!`
` Who's gonna set things...`
`right...`
`for her?!!"`
`"......But what you're saying is also right.`
` Even though the cheating was a fact, I still owed him for raising me."`
`"So I thought I'd cancel those two things out and leave the family, what's the problem with that?!!`
` That's right, I had the right, ......no, the duty to wallop Dad in Mom's place, didn't I?!"`
`"I let him get away without that!`
` I left without saying anything, as though I hadn't been there in the first place!!`
` And Dad forgot about me and started a new family with Kyrie‐san and Ange!`
` That settles everything, doesn't it?!!"`
`But six years passed after that.`
` ......Time healed the anger.`
`Kyrie‐san understood my anger as well,`
` and she tried hard to interact with me despite that, and soften my heart.`
`Ange didn't know anything about the situation,`
` and she adored me, believing that I was her real big brother who just lived in a separate house.`
`......As for Dad, he was acting like nothing had happened, and told me I could come home any time I wanted.`
`"It started to feel more and more stupid keeping it all going!!`
` I thought it was about time for me to cool my head as well.`
` So I said to Dad that if he apologized, I'd call it water under the bridge.`
` On the day of Grandpa's funeral."`
`"And that guy, he actually put both his hands on the floor and apologized...!!`
` I couldn't believe how pathetic he looked...!"`
`"My dad, who was all about looking cool, actually bowed his goddamn head to me...!`
` ......When I saw that, it felt like it'd be stupid to keep it up any longer."`
`"I'm sure Mom would've thought the same thing!`
` Every time Dad and I fought, Mom would always laugh and mediate for us.`
` "Oh, that silly thing is what you were fighting over?"`
` she'd say.`
` ......I could feel Mom saying that and laughing...!!"`
`"That's why,`
` ......while I couldn't bring myself to say "I forgive you",`
` .........I thought it might be alright to start over again from zero.`
` So I decided to wind everything back to how it was six years ago.`
` .........And I returned to the Ushiromiya family register...!!`
` I'd cried, raged, and stressed over it for a whole six years!"`
`"It might have been the same for Dad, and maybe even for my dead mom.`
` Maybe Kyrie‐san and Ange too.`
` ......So we went back to zero, and I returned to being Ushiromiya Battler!!!`
` That's my immediate family's problem,`
` ......and has nothing the hell to do with the Ushiromiya family!!"`
`"You aren't qualified to judge that to be a sin, and I have no duty to show repentance to you!`
` If there was anyone I should have done that for, you've already killed them!!"`
`"So I won't apologize for anything!`
` I won't repent!!!`
` That is my answer for this test!!!"`
`"..........................................`
` ......Is that all...?"`
`"What.........?`
` .................."`
`I had pretty much fully responded to her provocation,`
` and I was sure that I'd vented out all the stuff that I'd been keeping inside my chest, stuff I hadn't wanted to show anyone.`
`That was what the witch had supposedly been hoping for, too.`
` ......And yet, the witch's blank expression didn't change in the slightest.`
`I had been sure she would start cackling and guffawing,`
` sneering at my childish, foolish, and shameful past.`
`But to the contrary, I could feel a sense of shock about her,`
` ......something you could almost call disappointment.`
`".........What do you mean "is that all", ......I've confessed everything inside me!`
` What aren't you happy about?"`
`"The atonement for your sins is still insufficient."`
`"Atonement?`
` ......What the hell, are you asking me to prostrate myself right here and apologize like Dad did...?!"`
`"............No.`
` I have no interest in the home affairs of your immediate family.`
` Where are we?`
` Rokkenjima.`
` The main residence of the Ushiromiya head family.`
` ......Isn't there a sin you should remember, fitting for this place......?"`
`"............Are you......saying that I have...another sin......?"`
`"......Remember, Ushiromiya Battler.`
` .........And it is your inability to remember which is your sin.`
` For that reason, I shall forgive you.`
` If you can remember, I shall forgive you.`
` .........Remembering that is my test of atonement for you."`
`".........That's......a lot easier said than done......"`
`"............Remember.`
` ......That is why it is a sin."`
`"...Sorry, Beato.`
` ......I have absolutely no memory of it."`
`"......You make it seem like I caused you trouble six years ago or something,`
` but unless I'm mistaken, this family conference is the first time we met.`
` It's true that your legend did exist six years ago,`
` but I'm pretty confident that we didn't know each other back then."`
`"......Naturally.`
` On the Rokkenjima of six years ago, I was not yet manifested."`
`"Then what kind of sin are you saying I have?`
` ......Are you saying......I've sinned against you somehow...?"`
`"Do not make me repeat myself.`
` I was not manifested six years ago.`
` For us to have been acquainted would be an impossibility.`
` In the world you represent, it was as though I did not even exist."`
`......Beato's cold eyes......felt as though they were accusing me of some kind of sin.`
`It felt, on the face of it, as though she was still holding a grudge for some way I'd treated her, and was criticizing me for it.`
`However, ......I obviously couldn't remember doing anything like that to her, and Beato had said so herself.`
`There was no link between us six years ago.`
`{p:1:Six years ago, no person called {f:5:Beatrice} existed for me}.`
`".........At least give me a hint.`
` ......Does this sin or whatever...have something to do with...`
`...you and me......?"`
`"I had no connection to you six years ago.`
` Remove me from your thoughts already.`
` ......Why...do you think it is a sin against {i:me}?"`
`".........Your......eyes."`
`"Eyes...?`
` ............Hoh."`
`"Your eyes, they're......whispering at me to apologize.`
` ......But I had no connection with you six years ago, and even you admitted that."`
`"............Is it true?`
` ......Is it really not a problem between me and you......?"`
`".........I already said it wasn't.`
` No problem between me and you has anything to do with this."`
`"But still, ......your eyes are telling me differently.`
` ............So I don't even have a clue.`
` .........Can you say it in red?`
` Can you declare that the sin you're telling me to remember isn't something between you and me?"`
`"...........................`
` ......Very well."`
`{p:1:The sin I am now demanding that you remember is not between Ushiromiya Battler and {f:5:Beatrice}}.`
`".........Then why are you looking at me with those eyes......?"`
`"I do not know.`
` .........I am simply gazing at you blankly.`
` If it feels that way to you,`
` ......perhaps that is because there is something that makes you feel that way."`
`"........................`
` .........What the hell kind of sin have I got?"`
`"{p:1:Ushiromiya Battler has a sin}."`
`"......I said what kind, dammit.`
` It's probably just some stupid sin, like hitting someone or tricking someone."`
`"{p:1:Because of your sin, people die}."`
`"L‐liar...!`
` I've never killed anyone...!!`
` Say it, then!`
` Who did I kill?!`
` When? Who? How?!"`
`"{p:1:Due to your sin, a great many humans on this island die}.`
` {p:1:None will escape, all will die}."`
`"Wh‐.........whaaaaat?!?!`
` Wh‐what the hell are you going on about?!`
` Are you saying {i:I} killed everyone?!`
` I'm a killer?!"`
`"You do not carry it out directly.`
` .........However, because you committed a sin, the cogs of fate were sent astray, spun a full six years, and due to the deviation that resulted,`
` ......tonight, this many lives are lost."`
`"{i:You are one of the causes of this tragedy}."`
`"......Oh, ......come the fuck on!!`
` {i:I'm} the cause?!`
` Then what?!`
` Are you saying thirteen people died because {i:I} abandoned the Ushiromiya register six years ago?!`
` Are you saying thirteen people died because {i:I} came back to the Ushiromiya family after six years?!"`
`"Give me a fucking break!!!`
` For these six years, I've been the man furthest from the Ushiromiya family!`
` What influence could {i:I} have had on {i:anything} and how?!"`
`"It's not like I came to the family conference because I wanted to!`
` I'd patched things up with the family after six years, so to like, draw a line under that whole period,`
` I came to Rokkenjima reluctantly...!!`
` It's not like I had some duty to come here today!"`
`"I came back, and because of that a tragedy occurred?`
` Then what?!`
` You're saying that if I hadn't come back, no one would've had to die?!"`
`"Say it in red!!`
` Can you say in red that if I hadn't come back, this screwed‐up murder case wouldn't have occurred?!`
` ......There's no way you can, because you're the culprit behind everything!!"`
`"Repetition requested!!`
` "If Ushiromiya Battler hadn't returned to Rokkenjima, the crime wouldn't have occurred".`
` Go on, say it if you think you can...!!"`
`"......Can't do it, can you?`
` There's no way in hell you can, the culprit is you, not me!!`
` Don't you dare try to push the blame for this onto meeeeeeee!!!"`
`"......................................."`
`"......Answer, in red!!`
` I said repeat it...!!`
` You can't!`
` My existence has nothing to do with the crime.`
` Stop messing with my heeeaaaad!!!"`
`I began to remember that the raindrops pounding down were cold.`
`......The rain earlier had just hurt,`
` ......but now I felt a tormenting cold from those raindrops......`
`".................................`
` ......Is there nothing that you remember?"`
`".........Sorry,`
` but I don't have a goddamn clue."`
`".............................."`
`"......Look.`
` ......I'm starting to get a little pissed off.`
` ......If there's something you wanna say, then say it.`
` If you have a grudge against me, you just have to come out and say it.`
` ......Don't be nasty about it and demand for me to remember."`
`"............I'll ask one more time.`
` ......Can you not remember any sin?"`
`"No!!`
` I can't remember a goddamn thing...!!"`
`".........So...`
`...he says that he can remember...nothing."`
`With this, are your regrets at an end......?`
`"...........................`
` ...............m...m..."`
`Even a hopelessly long shot will be a source of regret if not attempted.`
`......That will do.`
`The attempt itself has meaning.`
`".........That may be true.`
` ...In that case, this is...`
`the end of my regrets, and my game."`
`What will you do...?`
`"...Who knows.`
` .........I'm not interested at all anymore.`
` ......Sorry, but I wish to leave the game board now."`
`..............................`
` ......I see.`
` ......I understand.`
`"I will take over for the rest of the game.`
` .........You may rest."`
`"......Mm.`
` ..............."`
`"All that remains, I will finish.`
` .........You may forget everything and bury your head in your pillow.`
` A feather futon should gently protect you from everything."`
`".........Finish up the rest for me, ......please."`
`"Leave it to me.`
` ......Leave everything else to me, and sleep."`
`The witch who had questioned Battler hid herself,`
` and the other witch, who had appeared from behind, remained.`
`She was certainly identical, the same witch,`
` .........but her expression was somehow indifferent and ice‐cold,`
` ......a far cry from the one before, who, though apparently drunk, had at least been in high spirits.`
`"...............Hey!!`
` Are you listening?!`
` That's enough for that test thing, right?!`
` I don't give a crap whether I passed or failed!`
` The only thing that's gonna help the way I'm feeling is bashing you in the face!!`
` Get the hell down here!!`
` Or else open up this door...!!"`
`The witch said nothing back.`
`Her eyes were as ice‐cold as Battler's shoulders.`
`......She was clearly a different person from the one who had first appeared on that balcony.`
`The witch looked hard into my eyes, ......and gave two small shakes of the head.`
`Even without words, I was able to gather that she was expressing some kind of disappointment...`
`Without saying anything, the witch turned on her heels.`
`After that, only Battler remained, the cold rain still beating down on him.........`
`The study was in the middle of a lively party.`
`It seemed that Gaap was making fun of {f:5:Virgilia}, teasing her over some stupid triviality.`
`...They were spitting "Lialialia", "Gapgapgap" at each other.`
`Kinzo and Ronove had opened a new bottle and were enjoying the show.`
`"Oh, you're back.`
` How were the results of Battler's test?!"`
`"Maria's test got passing marks with no complaints, I'll have you know?`
` I've long held her in contempt as a worthless little urchin,`
` but lo and behold, surprise surprise, {nobr:my oh} {nobr:my oh} {nobr:my oh} my, not bad, not bad, not bad indeed!`
` Wa‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"`
`It seemed like Kinzo was dead drunk.`
`{n}He laughed towards Beato with the same level of excitation as the time they'd left for the tests.`
`...However, Ronove and {f:5:Virgilia} instantly noticed the change in her enthusiasm.`
`Gaap also froze her expression and went silent.`
`"Wahhahahahahahhahha, what is it, {f:5:Beatrice}, my beloved witch?`
` Not enough to drink? Not enough on the side?`
` Let's go out in the pouring rain and roast a cow whole, oohhh, not a bad idea!"`
`"Ronove, make the preparations right away!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}, let's leave the results of Battler's test for later.`
` Why don't we have a toast with spare ribs first, uwa‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"`
`"..................Roast yourself whole."`
`"‐ha‐hah‐hah‐hah,`
` ......what?"`
`As Kinzo doubled over laughing in a great mood, the witch who had spoken bluntly passed him coldly by.`
`......Then, behind the witch's back,`
` .........the old summoner's body suddenly went up in flames...`
`"Gyuoaaaaooaahhh!!!!`
` Gwohh, gah, ......gyah.........w...h...y............?!"`
`While spitting crimson flames from his eyes, mouth, nose...every hole on his body, Kinzo rolled around.`
`......Even though it was a terrible hellfire, it didn't burn anything except Kinzo.`
`Kinzo didn't have a clue what was going on.`
`......He rolled around, unable to understand why {f:5:Beatrice}, who had been in such a good mood,`
` had suddenly turned so cold......`
`The dancing silhouettes of witches and demons created by that massive rolling torch...`
`looked like a group of excited spectators around a burning at the stake.`
`However, the eyes of the demons watching over it were indifferent......`
`When Kinzo finally stopped moving, the fire disappeared, leaving a pitch‐black corpse.`
`The inside of the room was commanded by the stillness of the sound of the rain......`
`"......What has happened, Milady?"`
`"It has lost its thrill.`
` .........Clean up those bothersome cinders."`
`{f:5:Beatrice}'s expression......was unbelievably apathetic.`
`...There was an iciness there that told the others that they risked the same fate as Kinzo if they annoyed her.`
`"............Y‐yes.`
` I will do it..."`
`Gaap made a jet‐black pitfall swallow up Kinzo's cinders.`
`...If she hadn't carried that out quickly, Gaap might also have been burned.`
` You could feel that thirst for blood.`
`No, a thirst for blood probably isn't the best way to describe it.`
`......Just like humans don't have any particular emotion when they step on an ant while walking.`
`......That was how much, unconsciously and mercilessly, Beato was now filled with a brutal emptiness that wouldn't hesitate to bury a passerby...`
`"......Wh‐what is it, Beato?"`
`"I don't want to answer.`
` ...............No, I can't even be bothered to answer any more."`
`".........What is it? This isn't like you.`
` ......Did something happen?`
` Did Battler say someth—"`
`".........k...g...gyhh—"`
`{f:5:Beatrice} hadn't even responded.`
` It seemed that she had even ignored it.`
`But there was a change in Gaap.`
`From her feet, a crackling, cracking sound rose, like thin ice breaking,`
` ......and in an instant, turned Gaap into a glass sculpture.`
`"G‐......Gaap..."`
`"............Disappear for a while.`
` I'm in a very bad mood."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} spoke in a truly cold voice,`
` ......which froze the heart just to hear it.`
`"......Certainly.`
` In that case, please allow us to retire.`
` .........If you need anything, call at any time."`
`After a single bow, Ronove turned into a cloud of gold butterflies, and hid himself.`
`{f:5:Virgilia} turned Gaap from a sculpture into a group of gold butterflies,`
` and then turned into a cloud of them herself, which mixed in with the others and disappeared.`
`............In the study made untidy by drinking,`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice} stood still, alone.`
`Since the time she had returned, her expression hadn't changed in the slightest...`
`......However, when she saw the fallen empty wine bottles and scattered cheese plates,`
` her brow furrowed, and she looked a bit displeased.`
`And when she whispered "disappear", in that instant, the room flashed, and was tidy again, as though nothing had ever happened.`
`The reception chairs were neatly arranged, and there was no wine or cheese.`
`{n}There were no stains where things had been spilled, nor was there any scattered trash.`
`......To the contrary, even the air had frozen over,`
` and, enough to make one doubt whether so many noisy people really had been in this room until just moments ago,`
` .........the study had returned to total silence.`
`.........In that silent, ......frigid study where even the air had frozen,`
` {f:5:Beatrice} stood still...`
`Then, she called him in a mutter.`
`"..................Battler.`
` Are you there?"`
`"......I've been here for a while.`
` .........What the hell's going on with you?`
` You've been acting strange."`
`"Do I seem strange?`
` My apologies."`
`"............Even though you were having such a good time drinking with that damn old fart, you suddenly burned him up,`
` and your demoness friend is a glass sculpture.`
` ......Even your demon butler and your master got a "disappear and get the hell out".`
` ......Just how fickle and selfish are you?"`
`"Battler. I'm done."`
`"With what?"`
`"............I've had enough, now."`
`"Wha?`
` .........Well, uh, you were the one who cooked up this game.`
` Heh, if you've had enough, that's great for me.`
` So basically, you're resigning?"`
`"I am not resigning.`
` I am just ending it.`
` No, I won't even end it.`
` The game will simply be abandoned for all eternity."`
`"Pretty sure they call that resigning.`
` ......Man, the words "got tired of it and threw it away" fit you perfectly."`
`"Precisely.`
` I am tired of it and am throwing it away.`
` I don't care about the rest.`
` It can remain abandoned and gather dust as much as it likes."`
`"........................`
` ......What's up with you?`
` You've been kinda hard to deal with since a short while ago."`
`"......Are you still sour over that baffling test?`
` If you've got something against me, all you have to do is say it clearly."`
`"You said in red that it has nothing to do with you, but that's got to be a play on words, right?`
` It's written all over your face.`
` You have a grudge against me."`
`"How many times will I have to say I have no grudge against you before you'll understand?`
` At the time you left your sin behind, I did not exist."`
`As Beato spoke with an irritated expression, her face twisted to look even more displeased.`
`Fickle.`
` Inconsistent.`
` Moody.`
` Temperamental.`
` ......Selfish and simple‐minded and cruel.`
`But even so, she had never shown an expression as strange as this even once before now...`
`"............Well, you were the one who instigated this game.`
` I'm a bit let down that it won't get resolved, but feel free to invite me again sometime if you feel like it.`
` But when that time comes, allow me to politely decline, alright?`
` Heheheh."`
`He intentionally spoke in a teasing kind of tone, but Beato showed no reaction.`
`......Battler hung his head and clicked his tongue...`
`"I've circled around October 4th and 5th over and over again, but it looks like I'm finally going to be free of all that now.`
` ......This way, the boat will come tomorrow."`
`"...That's right, then the seagulls will return to the harbor.`
` ......I'll finally be able to hear Rokkenjima's signature "nyaa nyaa" cries.`
` After all, when I came to the island, they weren't there at all, maybe because of the weather."`
`".........‘When the seagulls cry, everything will end’, basically.`
` ......Done and done, all over, the end.`
` Man, what a relief."`
`".........Exactly what is it that you're misunderstanding?"`
`"Hm?`
` What do you mean what?"`
`".........I said that nothing would end.`
` With this, everything will be abandoned.`
` The game will be forgotten, and the pieces on the board will be left where they lie.`
` There will be no advancing, no retreating, no taking or being taken.`
` No victory, no defeat, not even a tie.`
` Just abandoned."`
`"............Doesn't that mean it's over?"`
`"Wrong.`
` On my turn, the game will stop for all eternity.`
` Your turn will not come.`
` So there will be no victory, nor defeat, nor a tie."`
`".........In the past, I could not allow you to do that to me.`
` That was because I had the goal of victory against you.`
` However, I have lost interest in that.`
` So there is no longer any point in me making any further moves."`
`"............What do you mean by...my turn won't come...?"`
`I'd thought that Beato getting tired of the game meant I'd be released, and I'd be able to escape Rokkenjima.`
`But for some reason, the meaning of Beato's repeated words about the difference between abandoning the game and settling it...`
`...was starting to bother me...`
`.........Just what has she been saying, ...and why the bad mood......?`
`Suddenly, I heard a voice from behind me.`
`When I turned around, ......there was someone I thought I might, or might not, remember from somewhere...`
`......A mysterious girl, with no light in her eyes, was standing there.`
`".........What she means is something like this.`
` ......Putting the lid back on this game, leaving the pieces as they are.`
` Without ending, the game will be locked away for all eternity."`
`"The only way for you to return to your original world is to win against Beato.`
` .........So Beato abandoning the game would mean...`
` ......Get it?"`
`Suddenly, in another place, there was a girl wearing a bright pink dress.`
`......I had a feeling I'd met her somewhere too, but I couldn't remember.`
`More important was the meaning of the words she said.`
`{n}......The game being abandoned means......huh?`
`".........That's all there is to it.`
` No match can reach its conclusion without two opposing sides.`
` .........It means that you'll never be able to win and escape this world for all eternity."`
`"In the end, ......it's kinda like taking the key to the cage that you're locked in,`
` fastening it to the collar of a pigeon or something and letting it fly, I guess."`
`"............This isn't funny, Beato.`
` We didn't come all the way here to watch a boring game like this.`
` Just wrapping it up here? You have to be kidding me."`
`".........I'm with Lambda.`
` I came here to make Battler win, and to make you thrash about in defeat.`
` I still haven't achieved that goal.`
` ......I couldn't bear for the game to be abandoned here, for you to just run away on me."`
`"I acknowledge that the way the curtain has fallen on this game has made for a disappointing end for you ladies.`
` ......However, I, the host of this tea party, am after all fickle.`
` Once the fun is gone, I know no way of entertaining.`
` ......I believe that to be what makes me the witch I am in the first place.`
` There should be no problems with this...?"`
`"..............................`
` ......True.`
` I won't go against your creed."`
`"I won't stand for this...`
` ......Don't you dare, how much do you think I've supported you...`
` All that preparation, and you want me just to pack it all in now?`
` I don't think so...!!"`
`"I am saying that I have tired of it.`
` Nothing more, nothing less."`
`"That's not happening...`
` You're going to continue this game.`
` You want to win against Battler, right?`
` You want to win and make him submit, right?!`
` You're almost there!`
` Isn't she~?!"`
`".........D‐don't turn to me for agreement.`
` ......That said, I do have an opinion too.`
` If you'll let me say it."`
`"............What."`
`"You brought this fight to my door.`
` I'm prepared to settle this fight one way or the other.`
` ......I've come close to surrendering many times,`
` but I've never had any intention of escaping part‐way through, leaving the match undecided."`
`"......As long as I'm here, showing the will to fight,`
` ......don't you go running away, {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"............I agree.`
` Getting Battler involved and then leaving without giving him victory or defeat is just beyond irresponsible."`
`Suddenly, even Gretel was there.`
`{n}......And everyone was criticizing Beato for being irresponsible.`
`"Hoh.`
` .........It seems that the greatest reason I am being called irresponsible is that Battler will be stuck as an opponent."`
`".........In that case, Battler.`
` Will you step down from being an opponent, as I shall?`
` That way, there will be nothing to criticize me for."`
`"If I step down, will I be able to leave Rokkenjima...?"`
`"Of course not.`
` Just be covered in dust and let it pile up on your shoulders."`
`".........Stop being so stupid.`
` Just how irresponsible are you?`
` You've killed all this many people.`
` On top of that, using your witch's power, you've done it over and over.`
` In gruesome ways!`
` .........There's no way I can allow you to escape without taking responsibility...!"`
`"Responsibility.`
` ......Hoh, what is it I should do to take this so‐called responsibility?"`
`"Fight until a resolution is reached.`
` Battler will sit in the chair across from you, never giving up, and fighting until he beats you.`
` So you too fight until you're defeated.`
` If you don't want that to happen, then try and defeat him...!!"`
`"I won't let you...leave everything unresolved and abandon Battler in this chair,`
` ......lock him up forevermore and never let him return...`
` .........I won't let you......!!"`
`"......Gretel."`
`To be perfectly honest,`
` I didn't really understand from what standpoint Gretel was trying to save me.`
`......But in her words,`
` I could feel a strong determination to save me from this crazy game world no matter what.`
`So, I also responded to that.`
`"Beato.`
` Face this way."`
`"....................."`
`"I am here.`
` Across from you, in the rival's seat.`
` ......Get it?`
` As long as I continue to sit here,`
` I won't permit you to escape.`
` ......So don't run away. Fight."`
`"You started this fight, dammit.`
` All the crap you've pulled, again and again and again, the total shitshow you've turned this whole thing into!`
` And now after all this time you think I can let you end it because you're {i:tired} of it?!!"`
`"I am your opponent!!`
` As long as I'm here,`
` there's no way I'm letting you escape!!"`
`"Are you listening, you goddamn Witch of Irresponsibility?!`
` Why don't you say some{-}thiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}ing!!!"`
`After I yelled at her, ......Beato went silent for a while.`
`Whether my words had reached her, or whether she was thinking about something completely different...I couldn't tell.`
`But for a while, she was silent,`
` ......gazing at me with an expression I could read no emotion from,`
` ......and when she realized that I noticed, she averted her gaze.`
`Then she turned her back to me, ......and said this...`
`"So you ladies say that......since Battler will not quit as my opponent, you cannot accept my abandonment of this game."`
`"............In that case, I shall ask...`
`whether the man over there was qualified to be my opponent in the first place."`
`".........Qualified?"`
`"...Probably has something to do with that test or whatever just now."`
`"...............What are you planning to do...?"`
`"...Y‐...you aren't gonna—"`
`"I will now question you to determine whether or not you are qualified to be my opponent."`
`".........Listen, now, Battler.`
` If those qualifications are acknowledged, I will stay in my seat and continue the game.`
` And I shall promise to fight for all eternity until the outcome is decided."`
`"Heh!`
` I was ready for that from the beginning."`
`"............However,`
` if you are not qualified,`
` ......you will disappear.`
` If the opponent disappears, there is no game.`
` I can leave this place openly.`
` .........Are you ladies satisfied?`
` I will not permit interruptions."`
`"..............................`
` ......Go ahead, do as you like."`
`"......B‐...Battler...`
` You......make sure you answer well..."`
`"The very reason I'm here is because I'm qualified, right?`
` Heh, there's nothing to be scared of...!"`
`".....................`
` .........Y‐......you couldn't be......"`
`Gretel grew suddenly pale.`
` ......I'd thought her to be the calm, collected type, so her expression surprised me.`
`"......Well then, Battler.`
` I shall have you repeat in red."`
`"Y‐you're giving me a repetition request?`
` Heheh... Damn you, stealing my signature move.`
` ...But can I do the red truth too?`
` How...?"`
`"............Ju‐just will it to be so and you can do it.`
` It's easy."`
`"{p:1:My name is Ushiromiya Battler}.`
` ......Wh‐......whoa, pretty cool."`
`"Stop it!!`
` I know what you're after...!!`
` But don't do it!`
` He's......!!"`
`When Gretel yelled, Beato glared at her.`
`{n}Then, her form was wiped away in an instant.`
`"Shut up.`
` You leave your seat for a while.`
` You too, ladies.`
` If you are going to interfere, I will not hold back."`
`"...............We won't get in the way.`
` Go ahead, do as you like."`
`"B‐Bern, this is bad!!`
` She's trying to erase him, she's trying to erase Battler!!"`
`"......What......?`
` What is it she's......scheming here......?"`
`"Well then, I shall question your qualifications.`
` ............Interesting.`
` Attack and defense are reversed from a normal game.`
` This is a very precious experience, coming at the very, very end.`
` .........Ready? First listen carefully.`
` I will speak with the red first."`
`{p:1:I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}}.`
`{p:1:And I opened this game in order to fight Ushiromiya Kinzo's grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler}.`
`"......I know that.`
` So what?"`
`"Repetition requested.`
` .........‘Ushiromiya Battler's mother is Ushiromiya Asumu’."`
`"Whaa?!`
` ...Why's Mom's name popping up all of a sudden......?"`
`"I do not require chatter.`
` Just repeat it in red."`
`Beato urged me with the same indifferent tone.`
`......But I don't have a clue what she's trying to do.`
`{n}......I've done absolutely nothing wrong that I'd hate to be confronted with, and there's nothing that I'm hiding.`
`There's nothing she could demand for me to repeat that would cause me any trouble.`
`{n}......So, why something like this...?`
`"Sure, I'll repeat it.`
` {p:1:Ushiromiya Battler's mother is Ushiromiya Asumu}.`
` ......The red sure is convenient.`
` No need to bother myself with bringing a copy of the family register."`
`"I do not require chatter.`
` I will continue.`
` "Your name is Ushiromiya Battler"."`
`"......Sure.`
` {p:1:My name is Ushiromiya Battler}."`
`"It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that Ushiromiya Battler was born."`
`"{p:1:It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that Ushiromiya Battler was born}."`
`"It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that you were born."`
`"{p:1:It was from Ushiromiya}...`
`{m:-5:—}—...`
`...hhnguh...`
`...{nobr:{m:-5:——}—}?!`
` {nobr:{m:-5:——}—}?!?!"`
`All of a sudden, my throat closed...`
`{n}I was suddenly assaulted by a shortness of breath that felt as if I had been choked.`
`Wh‐.........what's going on......?`
` O‐......one more time......`
`"It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born...`
` ...Dammit...`
` It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born..."`
`"............Wh‐what the hell?`
` Even though I was doing it so easily a second ago, I suddenly stopped being able to get the red to work...!"`
`"........................Do you decline to repeat it?"`
`"I'm not declining...!!`
` It's not working for some reason...!!`
` It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born...!!`
` Why?!`
` Dammit, why can't I use the red?!`
` What the hell?!?!"`
`"..................tch..."`
`"..........................."`
`My Mom is Ushiromiya Asumu!`
`{n}Why can't I say that fact in red?!`
`{n}What's going on...?!`
` Th‐this is......gghh—!!`
`"If you try to forcefully speak red that cannot be spoken, you will choke.`
` There is no need to strain yourself.`
` .........Allow me to use the aforementioned fact to press you in blue."`
`"......Do you remember?`
` The blue is used to proclaim a theory for the opponent to deny.`
` They are then burdened with the responsibility of denying that in red, and if they do not, then it is victory.`
` .........Then let me begin."`
`{p:2:Due to the previous repetition request, and the refusal to repeat,}`
` {p:2:I proclaim that you are not qualified to be my opponent}.`
`{p:2:After all,}`
` {p:2:{f:5:Beatrice} opened this game in order to fight with "Ushiromiya Kinzo's grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler"}.`
`{p:2:This gave you the responsibility, as my opponent,}`
` {p:2:to declare in red that you are "Ushiromiya Kinzo's grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler"}.`
`{p:2:You declined to repeat that}.`
`{p:2:This means the loss of your qualifications}.`
`"......D‐......deny something about that in red...`
` ...Quickly!!"`
`"S‐sure...`
` I,`
` {p:1:I am Ushiromiya Battler}...!`
` Given that I'm able to repeat that in red, that should mean that I'm your opponent!!"`
`"It may be a fact that you have the name Ushiromiya Battler.`
` However...`
` {p:2:People's names are not exclusive}.`
` {p:2:It is possible for multiple humans to have the name Ushiromiya Battler}."`
`"`
`{p:2:What it comes down to is this}.`
` ......{p:2:You are a different person with the same first and last names as Ushiromiya Asumu's son, Ushiromiya Battler}."`
`"Wh‐......what......?!!`
` Don't be so stupiiiiiiiiid!!`
` I'm Mom's kid!!`
` Ushiromiya Asumu's kid!!"`
`"`
`{p:1:It was from Ushiro}miya Asumu that...`
`—...`
`hkkhk—`
`......nn'g'g'gkkhh......!!!`
` ............*gasp*!"`
`"Shit!!`
` Why?!`
` Why can't I say that I was born from my mom?!`
` How could something so stupid be true?!"`
`"No need to suffer.`
` I will not toy with you.`
` ......This is checkmate.`
` {p:1:You are not Ushiromiya Asumu's son}."`
`...............Wha—...............`
`"You're.........`
`kidding......me..............."`
`"Who are you?`
` What person calling themselves Ushiromiya Battler?"`
`"W‐...wait a second...`
` ......I am...Ushiromiya Battler......`
` It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born, and I'm Mom and Dad's son...!"`
`"No.`
` There is no way that you are the Ushiromiya Battler with qualifications as my opponent.`
` And as proof..."`
`"Proof?!"`
`"You do not know of that sin six years ago."`
`".........Uh,`
` .........th‐that's............"`
`"No, if you were the true Ushiromiya Battler, you would not commit a sin.`
` But consequently, a sin did occur, a span of six years became a blank space,`
` and a man who knew nothing of that time appeared on Rokkenjima calling himself Ushiromiya Battler.`
` ............The truth of it all...goes like this."`
`Six years ago, ......the true Ushiromiya Battler, qualified to be my opponent, was already dead.`
`You were involved in a plot by Rudolf having something to do with distribution of the inheritance...`
`a body double set up in Ushiromiya Battler's place.`
`"I, ......I've never heard anything so stupid.........`
` .........That's......just......absurd............"`
`"......B‐Battler......!`
` Get ahold of yourself...!!"`
`"...........................Well.`
` ...If he can't counter back, there's nothing more to do.`
` ...Battler did not possess the qualifications.`
` That's how it is."`
`"A‐are you okay with that, Bern?!`
` If you accept that, you'll lose too, you know?!"`
`"Uh, and you'll win.`
` ......Why are you taking Battler's side......?"`
`"Mgh, ............mghhh..."`
`"How disappointing, Battler.`
` .........It really is disappointing that you didn't have the qualifications to be {f:5:Beatrice}'s opponent.`
` I was careless myself.`
` I can't believe I bet on an unqualified piece.`
` ............You've defeated me utterly, {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......There is no victory or defeat.`
` The opponent will simply disappear.`
` Perhaps I should say that he was never there in the first place."`
`"But then......who.........am I......?`
` Am I......not Mom and Dad's kid......?!"`
`"Who am I...... What am I......?`
` ............If I'm not Mom's kid, ......then what, are you saying I'm some total stranger's kid with no relation to them at all?!"`
`"If that is the case, it would mean that you do not share Kinzo's blood.`
` Either way, you are not qualified to compete in this game."`
`"...............Absurd.........`
`.........absurd..............."`
`"Enough.`
` ......I was slightly aware that you might not be Ushiromiya Battler in the first place.`
` ......So, I had to question you.`
` I had to ask about something the real Battler would have known."`
`"............What a shame.`
` I even bet on the one in a quadrillion chance of a miracle,`
` that you might really be Ushiromiya Battler.`
` However, it looks like you're a different person with the same first and last names after all."`
`"............kh.........uuunghhh............"`
`Bit by bit, Battler's form......began to be clouded in darkness...`
`No, maybe it was the other way around.`
` ......The whole world was becoming clouded in darkness, leaving only Battler behind...`
`Battler was down on all fours, hanging his head and repeatedly questioning himself.`
`......However, he would never be given an answer......`
`In the world stained with darkness, Beato spoke something, and {f:5:Lambdadelta} ran up to Battler yelling something very quickly,`
` but it already seemed very far away, and it didn't reach his ears...`
`............Then he,`
` .........not knowing who "he" was,`
` ............erased...`
`himself............`
`"BATTLEEEEEEEEEEER......!! ......nn...gh........."`
`"Now the opponent has disappeared.`
` ......Well then, if you would excuse me.`
` And ladies, you should prepare for your journey.`
` No more festivities are prepared for in my territory.`
` It was good seeing you.`
` ......Goodbye."`
`Without saying anything more,`
` Beato clouded her own form in darkness as well, and disappeared......`
`"A‐.........are you......alright with this?!`
` Battler......d‐disappeared, you know?!`
` Someone who hates losing as much as you do is okay with this?!"`
`"..................Weren't you betting on my defeat?`
` Then you should be over the moon.`
` Congrats, Lambda.`
` Well then, let's meet again in some other world, okay?"`
`"That said, there are endless fragment worlds out there.`
` The probability of us having some connection again somewhere is probably truly less than one in a quadrillion.`
` ............Alright, it was fun.`
` Bye‐bye."`
`"Ah, ...wait up, Bern...!!!"`
`Chasing after {f:5:Bernkastel}, who had disappeared first, {f:5:Lambdadelta} disappeared as well...`
`Then, after everyone had disappeared, .........there was no one left in the study.`
`It returned to silence, almost as though no one had been there from the beginning.`
`{n}......No one was here in the first place.`
`The silent study told of that wordlessly, and the sound of the wind and rain began to fill the room bit by bit......`
`In a world where everything had sunk into darkness, Beato questioned herself.`
`"......The fact is............from the very beginning, magic should only have been used within Mariage Sorcière."`
`"............Yes.`
` ...I thought that too,`
` ......when Ange happened."`
`"The witches' alliance began with you and me.`
` Just two people.`
` ......Mixing in other people was the first mistake..."`
`".........It was just so much fun.`
` ...That's why we wanted to add other people close to us into that circle.`
` And in that way, we wished for the witches' alliance to grow forever larger,`
` so everyone could have fun using magic together, and all become happy."`
`"But.........in the end, you and I were the only ones able to understand magic."`
`"We're......the only two witches in this world, brought together by a miracle.`
` .........As long as I have you, Beato, I don't need anyone else anymore."`
`"............Nor I.`
` As long as you are here, I no longer need anyone else."`
`"In the very first moment that Mariage Sorcière was formed,`
` ......it was already complete."`
`"...............That is...so.`
` That is truly so......"`
`It was a witches' alliance to make everyone happy together, with magic.`
`{n}......I wonder when it got this screwed up?`
`What was I trying to do when I started this game?`
`{n}......I can't really remember even that.`
`No, I may remember,`
` ...but that's a feeling I now wish to throw away to the far side of oblivion.`
`".........It's alright.`
` Let's just forget everything, okay?`
` Our little two‐person Mariage Sorcière.`
` ......We'll accept each other.`
` And no one will be able to hurt us.`
` So we won't be hurt anymore. We won't cry."`
`"Let's forget everything.`
` ............Okay, Beato?`
` ......We...are eternal......"`
`"..............................Maria......`
` ............uuuuuuuu, .........uuuuuuuuuuuuu...!!"`
`"Amakusa, could you turn that off?"`
`"Whoops, my bad.`
` You don't like {nobr:M. Zakky}?"`
`"I'm just not in the mood."`
`Amakusa turned the radio off.`
`The world of cheery sounds was immediately swallowed up by the roar of the sea,`
` and blotted out by the ocean's gray......`
`".........See it?`
` Over there's where the harbor was at the time."`
`".............................."`
`The boat captain pointed, but I couldn't really recall how it looked twelve years ago.`
`......I had believed that my memories of back then would come flooding back into my mind,`
` ...but no memories were coming back to me at all.`
`After the incident, the island was sealed off and left to the wild.`
`......Probably that's understandable, I had to tell myself, to stop myself from feeling somehow...sad and hurt.`
`.........Ah, but I at least remember one thing.`
`You could say that it would probably be the same anywhere on the sea, ......but at least this one thing, I do remember.`
`The cries...`
`of the seagulls.`
` I do remember those.`
`......I almost never went to the ocean when I was young.`
`...So, to me, everything that symbolized the ocean meant Rokkenjima, and my family getting together.`
`In short, ......it was a symbol for the happiness of going out with my family.`
`However, at this point in time, it even seems doubtful whether that was happiness at all.`
`In my younger days, the trip had felt like a relaxed family vacation, but considering my parents' situation at the time,`
` it was surely a very difficult trip to handle, with the distribution of the inheritance filling the place with the smell of flaring tempers and fuses about to blow.`
`I can remember giggling all over the place, completely ignorant of my parents' feelings...`
`"Rokkenjima, ......is it.`
` The beginning of everything, and the last stop for all journeys."`
`Amakusa tried too hard in an attempt to speak for my innermost feelings.`
`The boat slowly rounded the island.`
` ......As the angle changed, I hoped that my memories of the island's silhouette at the time might come back just a little,`
` but in the end, even as the inlet was completely hidden by the cliffs, I wasn't able to remember anything...`
`"......Captain, that thing you mentioned...`
`about the other harbor...please tell me about it."`
`"Mmhm.`
` .........They say Rokkenjima's only got one harbor.`
` But that's only its outward appearance."`
`"An extra hidden harbor on the back of the island.`
` .........That's Rokkenjima all over.`
` It has a second face, which no one knows about..."`
`"............Rokkenjima is an island in the possession of the Ushiromiya family.`
` But it has another face, as an island owned by Kinzo‐san personally......"`
`"One island, two harbors, two mansions, ......is it.`
` He sure spent a lot just so he could keep a mistress."`
`"Who knew about this other harbor...?"`
`"Not many.`
` Kinzo‐san, Genji‐san the butler.`
` Those of us involved with the boats,`
` and a very small number of the oldest servants.`
` ......The last owner of the Nanjo clinic and that Kumasawa baa‐san knew as well.`
` Naming 'em off like this makes it sound like there were a bunch of 'em, but I tell you now, it was only a very small number who knew."`
`"Please...tell me about that other mansion."`
`"......All's I was told is there's a mansion called Kuwadorian.`
` Wasn't allowed to leave the boat, so I never once saw the place, though."`
`"So it was far away enough that you couldn't see it from the harbor?"`
`"Beats me.`
` ......But it was a hidden mansion after all.`
` Probably was built where you can't see it from the outside.`
` ...Anyway, Kuwadorian was that island's biggest secret."`
`"There's a theory that {f:5:Beatrice} was being made to live in Kuwadorian,`
` or else was being confined there... What do you think, Captain?"`
`"......I carried over sundries meant for Kuwadorian, too.`
` Oftentimes that included stuff only women would use, and fancy stuff at that.`
` ......No doubt in my mind, that theory is true."`
`"So does that mean you never saw this {f:5:Beatrice} woman directly, Captain?"`
`"Never.`
` Came and went for close to twenty years, and never saw her once."`
`"Twenty years...!`
` Whew, so that's at least plus twenty onto her age.`
` Well, that shoots down my hopes for a mademoiselle."`
`"But one day, bang, all trips to and from Kuwadorian stopped.`
` That was about thirty years ago,`
` ......so around {ruby:Showa 43:1968}, I think."`
`"Bang?`
` You mean suddenly?"`
`"......We'd come by the back on a specified schedule to carry food and trash one way or the other.`
` ......Uh, when I say the back, I mean the harbor on the Kuwadorian side."`
`"I get it.`
` ...So then?"`
`"So one day, I get a sudden message from Genji‐san.`
` And he tells me, until you hear differently, we don't need you to go to the back anymore."`
`"And did you hear differently?"`
`"Not in particular.`
` To cut a long story short, one day, suddenly, I was told they didn't need regular service at the back anymore, and not to bother taking food there either.`
` ......Thought I'd been given the boot at first."`
`"But it wasn't long before I realized.`
` ......And I kind of got the picture from the reactions of the servants who knew of Kuwadorian, as well."`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice} died, and there was no longer any need to take food or people to care for her?"`
`"That's what I think.`
` I've never been told to take another boat to the back since.`
` But after that, Genji‐san came to see me face to face,`
` and got real pushy, demanding me to take everything about "the back" with me to the grave."`
`"So, if that hidden mansion was abandoned for twenty whole years,`
` .........why was Aunt Eva there?"`
`On that day twelve years ago...`
`......Ushiromiya Eva somehow escaped harm alone in a hidden mansion two kilometers away from the regular mansion.`
`Why was she in a hidden mansion that had been forgotten for twenty years.........?`
`"I saw that on the talk shows.`
` Even I can't make heads or tails of that.`
` Not once did I show Eva‐san to the back.`
` I don't have the first damn clue how she knew about Kuwadorian or how she got there."`
`"I wonder if it was possible to go to the back where Kuwadorian is by land."`
`"......If, as we heard, the forest was dense and uncultivated,`
` I seriously doubt a well‐dressed lady person'd be able to push through it."`
`"So what about by sea?`
` Maybe there was a motorboat or something."`
`"Are you kidding?`
` That two‐nighter typhoon was awful.`
` No way you could'a used a boat."`
`"What if there was......an underground passage or something between the mansion and Kuwadorian.`
` It would have been a pain to have to charter a boat each time he wanted to visit his mistress's house, right...?"`
`"A tunnel long enough to connect mansions on opposite sides of a two‐kilometer island like Rokkenjima...?"`
`"...Well, I'd like to laugh at the thought, but this is a guy so rich he made a whole hidden mansion for his mistress.`
` Guess I can't deny the possibility.`
` ......What do you think, Captain?"`
`"I'm a man of the sea.`
` No good asking me about holes.`
` But the Japanese military dug a {i:twenty‐five}‐kilometer tunnel on Iwo Jima.`
` Wouldn't surprise me one bit if {i:the} Kinzo‐san could dig at least two."`
`".....................This really is a strange island.`
` Even now, not one of us really knows a thing about it."`
`The boat reached the shore.`
` There would be a short walk to reach the mansion.`
`"......I'll wait here.`
` The mansion's that way.`
` The path from back then's probably still there, but I'll bet it's covered with plants.`
` Make sure you don't get yourself lost."`
`"Right, off we go, then?"`
`"Thanks, Amakusa.`
` But you wait here too."`
`".........Eh, I had a feeling you'd say that."`
`"I'm just delivering something.`
` You'll just be trouble for them if you're with me.`
` I imagine your toxin is strong."`
`"Toxin?`
` Hmm."`
`"I'll be back soon.`
` Our main goal today is Kuwadorian.`
` ......After I deliver this, I'll come right back."`
`Ange put on her knapsack and grabbed the flowers she was planning to offer.`
`"Take the hint, young'un.`
` ......Go on, gal.`
` Your family's waiting for you."`
`I had never been on a road like this, but I had no trouble finding my way.`
`{n}If I walked straight ahead, it would probably guide me to the final destination for everything.`
`The vegetation certainly was incredible, and you would lose track of the path if you were careless enough to let your attention drift.`
`......But the road that was left was much better than I had imagined.`
`Still, that didn't change the fact that it was a bad road.`
`......Contrary to the distance shown on the map, I was forced to walk a long way......`
`......The forest was deep and dark.`
`At the time, I had been threatened into staying away from the forest because a witch lived there.`
`Of course, that fear is gone now, .........but I feel it.`
`Other people may not be able to,`
` ......but I can feel the presence, like an aura, of the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`Massive, oddly shaped rocks scattered here and there. Overgrown trees and ivy.`
` ......The voices of birds and bugs.`
`Yeah, I can feel it.`
` .........I can feel...that the witch...is here......`
`Ahead, an ivy‐covered construction site fence and warning sign stood.`
`"NO ENTRY — TOKYO METROPOLIS".`
` That was written on it.`
`Oh, right.`
` When you think "Tokyo", you tend to think of a city,`
` but address‐wise, even Rokkenjima is a rightful part of Tokyo Metropolis.`
`......Apologizing to the sign for my mistaken impression, I climbed over the fence.`
`When I made it up the steep slope beyond that, ............my field of vision rapidly expanded,`
` and a fresh sea breeze blew through my hair......`
`It was like the top of a little hill.`
`......Below me was a vast view of the island.`
`I could only see desolated forest and rocky crags spread out below me.`
` ......But, somehow, I realized that the mansion was probably somewhere around there.`
`The steep downward slope beyond this hill had probably been caused by landslides from twelve years of wind and rain.`
`It had become a slant filled with crags that you might even call gentle cliffs,`
` and though it would be easy to tumble down, it looked like climbing back would be pretty difficult.`
`.........It seemed that proceeding any further would be impossible.`
`If I continued any further, I wouldn't be able to return.`
`{n}In other words, .........this is...the border.`
`Between 1986 and 1998.`
` That day and today.`
`{n}And this world and the other.`
`"............This is...`
`...this journey's...final destination, it seems."`
`As the strong wind blew Mammon and Sakutaro's hair, they looked down from the hilltop...`
`"......I can't make out a thing from here.`
` Where's the mansion?`
` Let's get closer."`
`‘Uryu, ...we can't.`
` We won't be able to come back.’`
`......We won't be able to...come back...`
`huh.`
`He's right.`
` ......This is 1998,`
` ......and I am the Ushiromiya Ange who has been left all alone.`
`At first, it was a journey to die.`
` But not anymore.`
`{n}It has become a journey to accomplish something......`
`"Yeah.`
` ......So, I'm sorry, you two.`
` As I was back then, on that day, I would have gone down this cliff without any hesitation."`
`"Come on, this is pretty lame for the skyscraper‐jumping Ushiromiya Ange."`
`"Sorry."`
`‘This place is just as good.`
` .........Because you can feel the wind of that day.’`
`"..................`
` ......Was the wind...really like this?"`
`‘Yeah.`
` They will come any moment.`
` ..................Everyone.’`
`Sakutaro said it as though it was completely natural.`
`{n}......And...I believed it.`
`Mom.`
` Dad.`
` Onii‐chan.`
`{n}All of my relatives, and those fun servants.`
`{n}And............Maria onee‐chan.`
`"It's me.`
` ......It's Ange.`
` ...............I've...come back."`
`When I started my final journey to expose the past of twelve years ago, its goal had been abstract, and I hadn't understood.`
`But now, ......I have no doubts.`
`This journey............was induced by all kinds of thoughts and fates over twelve years.`
`A journey to end things...for me, Ushiromiya Ange.`
`And a journey to end things...as the final witch of Mariage Sorcière.`
`I came here as the final daughter of the Ushiromiya family,`
` and as the final witch......`
`"......Mom, Dad, Onii‐chan.`
` ...Sorry.`
` Let me greet Maria onee‐chan first."`
`A strong gust of wind from behind urged me on.`
`That gust took just my soul out from inside my body, ......to the vast forest beneath me.`
`And, though I couldn't see it from where I stood, I believed that it would fly me to the mansion on that day,`
` to where everyone was...to where Maria onee‐chan was.`
`And so,`
` ......even though my body was on the top of the hill, a strong wind blowing against me,`
` .........my soul was now certainly dancing through that sky......`
`The vast, vast sky of Rokkenjima.`
`{n}......Below me was the green of many trees.`
`But...I can tell.`
` I can comprehend the presences of my family and relatives, and all the servants.`
` .........And...Maria onee‐chan too.`
`I could even comprehend......Maria onee‐chan as a witch.`
`It was vast, more vast than any space I had imagined up until now.`
`".........Maria onee‐chan.`
` Can you hear me......?`
` Listen......!!"`
`Ange shouted to the Maria of that day.`
`That she had been through a long journey.`
`And that she had learned just how much she had wounded Maria on that day when she was young.`
`Having understood magic, I now understand everything about the world Maria wanted to show me.`
`It is so warm, and overflowing with kindness and happiness.`
`......She had wanted to become even happier by sharing that world,`
` but I had trampled it.`
`"So now, I finally understand everything.`
` ......I understand...magic...!`
` Our magic is surely a very humble thing that exists all around us.`
` ......But it isn't something that just anyone can see with their eyes.`
` ............Magic is...`
`...yes, I can say it clearly."`
`{m:-5:—}—Without love, it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}.`
`I'm sorry, Onee‐chan.`
`......I've already been excommunicated from the witches' alliance, but...`
`{n}...after all this time, I now understand how wonderful it is.`
`And.........I know that after that day I wounded you, Mariage Sorcière was...`
`...transfigured into something different from what you truly desired.`
`.........Back in those days, even magic that allowed you to vent your anger by cursing people was probably important to you.`
`Your environment was unhappy enough for you to be allowed that.`
`"But...`
`......now, those unhappy days...are over.`
` ......So,`
` ......let's return your witches' alliance...`
`.........back to the original, gentle Mariage Sorcière."`
`The grimoire was in my hands without me realizing it.`
`......The strong winds were rapidly blowing its pages one after another......`
`It had been a kind world at first.`
`What to do to create magic so that candy rains from the sky.`
`What to do to create magic so that tomorrow's dinner becomes cream croquettes.`
`What to do to create magic so that tomorrow's weather is good when you go out, and you have a fun day.`
`New magics of happiness were created one after another, coloring her world with kindness...`
`Those days were flipped through one after another,`
` .........and the days and months began to flash by like memories...`
`The pages with drawings that were colorful...`
`gradually changed into pages colored only with black ink......`
`......Eerie magic circles, and demon summonings.`
`{n}Evil magic for harming people.`
`What to do to create magic so that the class bully catches a cold.`
`What to do to create magic so that you‐know‐who in class gets seriously injured and dies.`
`What to do to create magic so that a bus with all the bullies on it falls off a cliff.`
`Malicious magics were created one after another,`
` ......filling the pages and her heart...`
`"It was because I hurt you, Onee‐chan...`
`that Mariage Sorcière ended up like this.`
` .........You aren't a black, evil witch.`
` ......You were a white, ......pure, innocent,`
` ......kind witch......"`
`"......I'll...return you to how you were.`
` Originally, when you were scattering magic to make people happy across the entire world.`
` ......I'll turn you back into that Maria onee‐chan."`
`"......That is the reason I came here.`
` I was guided by fate.`
` ............Onee‐chan, can you hear me......?`
` Show yourself.........before me.........!!"`
`That voice rode an even stronger wind, and was sent twelve years into the past......`
`Then,`
` ......the wind gradually ceased,`
` .........and silence fell......`
`Crunch, crunch.`
` ......I could hear the sound of gravel being stepped on.`
`I heard those footsteps, and was surprised at that miracle.`
`{n}......Without a doubt, those footsteps were Maria onee‐chan's.`
`"............Ma‐......Maria onee‐chan........."`
`"Kasumi.`
` ......Looks like I finally found you, eh, Ange‐chan.........?"`
`"........................"`
`......Before I knew it, Aunt Kasumi and her black‐suits, a total of seven people who didn't resemble Maria onee‐chan in the slightest,`
` were standing there, surrounding me.`
`And it felt like my voice had been just about to reach Maria onee‐chan, too......`
`...Because of these guys' toxin, .........the magic got interrupted...`
`Ange clicked her tongue at that, but Kasumi probably didn't hear it that way.`
`"............Oh?`
` Are those flowers for your deceased family?`
` ......How admirable.`
` You're going to throw them, right?`
` That's alright, we'll wait that long."`
`......Before what.`
`{n}...Ange could more or less guess.`
`The way the black‐suits had their hands unnaturally stuck into their pockets made me realize that they were obviously in possession of handguns.`
`.........This is a deserted island.`
`{n}There could be no more convenient place to dispose of someone.`
`I have absolutely no interest in the family matters of the Sumadera family.`
`...But if I die, all of that wealth will roll right into the Sumadera family coffers.`
`Unlike me, they probably have a great deal of interest in it.`
`Of course, the Ushiromiya Group has a stake in this, too—it seems that if the massive amounts of stock I own suddenly go to the Sumaderas,`
` it'll be pretty bad for the Ushiromiya Group as well,`
` and so they've apparently gotten themselves embroiled in a secret feud over me.`
`......That's probably why President Okonogi gave me Amakusa as a guard.`
`............Having Amakusa wait on the boat was a regretful mistake...`
`"How long have you been waiting here in ambush......?"`
`"Since early morning.`
` And I was getting thoroughly tired of waiting for you.`
` There are no cafés or powder rooms here, you see."`
`"No toilets either, so I guess you had to elegantly drop a load behind a tree.`
` .........ack—"`
`"One who, in spite of herself, is a lady with half Sumadera blood flowing through her veins will not use such filthy words.`
` .........You really are Sumadera Kyrie's child, aren't you?`
` Not a trace of grace."`
`She grabbed me by the hair and forced my face up to hers.`
`{n}And then spat in it.`
`......My words are filthy, but her spit's not to be outdone.`
`".........Every time you talk about me, it's always with reference to Mom.`
` ...Am I really that much like my mother?"`
`"Yes, you are.`
` ...............That impertinent gaze.`
` Your mouth and nose are the same too."`
`"......Unrestrained and irresponsible.`
` ......She thought nothing of the long history and tradition of the Sumadera family, and selfishly flew out of the house.`
` My entire life has been wiping up the messes she left behind...!"`
`"I guess that makes your life one giant pile of shit."`
`I was slapped on the cheek, my ear took a heavy hit, and for an instant, my head rang...`
`.........She pulled me around by the hair, and threw me onto the ground.`
`And without a moment's pause, she kicked the ground, covering me in sand.`
`"Yes, you truly have become so very like Nee‐san.`
` That gaze!`
` That gaze like you're somehow making fun of me.`
` Yes, it's all coming back, all of it!"`
`".........You are pitiful.`
` I imagine that since you were young, you were always compared against Mom and looked down upon.`
` ......And for the entire rest of your life, you'll never be released from that misery."`
`"A little brat like you couldn't possibly understand.`
` ......Your mother, you see, is a loser who threw away everything and ran away from the Sumadera family.`
` Do you know how much...`
`how {i:much} trouble I went through because of that loser?!!"`
`"Any trouble you went through has nothing to do with me.`
` Can't really do anything about what happened before I was born."`
`".........When is your life going to begin?`
` ......It's never going to happen.`
` You will continue to be sneered at by my dead mother, for ever and ever for all eternity until you die.`
` ......In fact, why {i:don't} you die?`
` Why are you alive?"`
`"You little insolent pissant...!!`
` Men...!`
` Make her some tea."`
`"Heheheh...`
` Leave it to us..."`
`"You big‐mouthed shitty brat.`
` Let us teach you a little lesson."`
`The black‐suits dashed up to me, violently grabbed me by the collar, and dragged me down.`
`"Do as you like until I finish this smoke.`
` Teach my darling niece a little of her place."`
`Sumadera Kasumi.`
` She was a pitiable person, to think of it.`
`To the outside world, the women of the Sumadera family were trained to be in a position to support and defer to the men in the prominent positions.`
`......But in actuality, strong leadership was demanded of them so that they could manage all of the people under them.`
`The role demanded of them was that of a female commander.`
`Taking charge of the Sumadera family with all its proud history required an extraordinary level of commanding presence.`
`It was an unimaginably heavy responsibility.`
`Normally, this would have been demanded of Kyrie.`
`Kyrie had undergone that harsh training.`
`{n}And Kasumi, as the younger sister, should have been able to just take it easy.`
`No, in fact, she had lived like a lazy, selfish, and affluent princess, sneering at Kyrie, who had been given the heavy responsibility.`
`......However,`
` Kyrie was suddenly disinherited.`
`She had refused the fiancé her parents had arranged, and had gotten pregnant by her lover, Ushiromiya Rudolf.`
`From the Sumadera family's perspective, even though the Ushiromiya family held a vast fortune, it was a family which had already collapsed, a family not in their league.`
`And to become not even a legal wife, but a {i:lover} to the second son of that family...`
`Normally, no one would be shown mercy for something so dishonorable, not even a daughter of the main family.`
`They would wrap her up in a mat, stand a pole on end,`
` and throw her either into the Pacific Ocean if the pole fell to the right or the Sea of Japan if it fell to the left.`
`.........But Kyrie's punishment was nothing but disinheritance, an unbelievably lenient decision.`
`After that, the Sumadera family began receiving preferential treatment from a section of the Ushiromiya Group.`
` ......There must have been some kind of backroom deal.`
`In other words, Kyrie took advantage of the Ushiromiya family's financial support to leave the Sumadera family openly.`
`Kasumi watched it happen in shock.`
`{n}No, she even disparaged her dishonorable sister as a loser.`
`......But eventually...`
`...she learned that the heavy responsibilities Kyrie had borne would be passed on to her,`
` and then, for the first time, she realized that she had been outwitted......`
`"Because of your mother, my life was turned into a mess.`
` ......No, you could even say she killed me once.`
` On that day, I was killed once and cast down into a hellish life..."`
`".........Isn't that just what you get for thinking you can breeze through life?`
` ......gyack!`
` .........*cough*, *cough*......"`
`"This girl doesn't know when to shut up!`
` Oorrrrah!"`
`The black‐suit punched me in the gut, and I doubled over.`
`{n}But I was quickly grabbed by the collar and made to stand up again.`
`As she continued to cold‐heartedly look down upon Ange, Kasumi blew out smoke......`
`{n}The hard days after Kyrie left were floating through her mind.`
`Until then, she had been allowed to be simply a rich young lady, unrestrained and unaffected.`
`{n}......Only Kyrie, the older sister, had been strictly trained, and she, the younger sister, had been able to live as nothing more than a princess.`
`Then, suddenly, everything was turned over to such a degree that her life tumbled and crashed......`
`"My life, lifestyle, way of living, ......everything was stolen from me.`
` .........Do you know how much I was maligned based on my sister's dishonor by those relatives who didn't know the details...?`
` ......I detested her.`
` I detested your mother enough to make me spit blood..."`
`"Glad to hear it.`
` I hope it continues for many years to come.`
` .........gagghh!!"`
`A kick landed in Ange's side as she lay prostrate on the ground.`
`{n}Ange didn't stand up again.`
`......So she continued to lie there like a caterpillar, getting kicked every time she spoke up.`
`"......I saw Nee‐san at an Ushiromiya Group party once.`
` ......She was with her husband,`
` .........looking very happy,`
` ......and laughing.`
` ......She...`
`...pushed everything onto me,`
` ......and found happiness...`
`......only for herself........."`
`".........So what?`
` How is taking it out on me going to make you happy?`
` Is taking it out on me going to turn back time and change history for you or something?"`
`".........Ugugggh,`
` .........gah,`
` .........*cough*......!!"`
`"You said something a short while ago...`
` When is my life going to begin?`
` .........No matter how much I despise you or take it out on you, I cannot turn back time.`
` ......So am I doomed to keep on hating Nee‐san like this for the rest of my life, even though she's dead?"`
`"Not if I can help it.`
` ......How long must I be tormented by Nee‐san's ghost?`
` And so I thought.`
` .........If I could pull this off, I would be able to forget all of my hatred and start over."`
`Ange was about to respond to this with another bitter comment, but stopped.`
`{n}...Because she would be kicked again if she responded.`
`......Even if Kasumi didn't say any more, it wasn't difficult to imagine what she meant.`
`{n}Kasumi was thinking of bringing an end to her hatred of Kyrie by taking revenge against her daughter, Ange.`
`.........Talk about pushing your problems on other people.`
`"Come on, stand up.`
` If you like this island that much, I'll bury you here deep.`
` .........You don't want to die at your age, right?`
` Don't you want to say "Sorry my mother caused you so much trouble", or something?"`
`".........You...`
`...wish.`
` .........gkkhhh,`
` .........glk, ......!!"`
`‘Uryuu!!`
` Ange, Angeeeeee...!!’`
`"Ange‐sama, no...!`
` You mustn't provoke these guys...!!`
` You should at least make it seem like you're going along with them, so you can buy some time...!"`
`".........They do say...`
`that you should throw your foolish pride...`
`out with the garbage......"`
`‘Wh‐what about Amakusa‐san...?!`
` If Amakusa‐san comes, I just know he'll......!’`
`"......No, it's no good, I can't see him...`
` ......You idiot, Ange‐sama...!`
` Why did you come without Amakusa...!"`
`I don't need you to tell me that, Mammon.`
`{n}......I'm already right in the middle of regretting it.`
`I walked a long way to get here.`
` The forest was very thick.`
`{n}......There's no way that the disturbance here will reach the boat......`
`As Kasumi took her sweet time smoking that single cigarette down to the filter,`
` I was continuously laid into by the black‐suits however they deemed fit.`
`The moment I grabbed my head to protect it, the top of my head was kicked by someone at a bad angle, and my head filled with stars......`
`{n}This feeling of stars flickering in a world twisted with gray...`
`...was one I knew well.`
`My life was very similar to the one Sumadera Kasumi led.`
`...Because I was tormented constantly with all kinds of bullying under the guise of education and training, to make me a worthy "successor to the Ushiromiya family".`
`Yes.`
` Having the inside of my head filled with stars like this...is a feeling I know well.`
`When being reprimanded for some error in manners I seemed to have made,`
` the lecture always turned to whether I was fitting to be the successor to the Ushiromiya family or not.`
`......On and on about the honor of the Ushiromiya family, and how important it was.`
`......By the time her rant reached that point,`
` I would forget what mistake I was being blamed for in the first place.`
`No, actually, it was the same way for Aunt Eva too.`
`After all, sometimes she would ask herself "Umm, what was I saying again?"`
`...But in the end, she wouldn't be able to remember, and would say something like:`
`"The fact that I'm angry must mean that you did something wrong.`
` So whatever wrong thing you did is the problem, and it isn't important that I can't remember what it was any more."`
`...There'd be some ridiculous reasoning like that, and then she would continue punishing me.`
`Yes.`
` Aunt Eva's punishments weren't something that would continue until I learned something, or acknowledged my mistake, or apologized.`
`.........They would continue until Aunt Eva wanted to stop.`
`{n}So even this violence was a bit nostalgic, in a way that made me want to vomit.`
`......I opened my eyes, ......and oh look, there's Aunt Eva.`
`Right next to Kasumi, who was smoking her cigarette,`
` I could see Aunt Eva, the two of them looking almost as though they were laughing at me together.`
`When I think about it, even Aunt Eva's life might be worthy of sympathy.`
`......The responsibilities and pressures of members of the Ushiromiya family, which she had so often mentioned to me,`
` were all things that she herself had suffered.`
`Because people cannot voice insults that they have never been subjected to themselves......`
`It was probably the same way for Aunt Rosa as well.`
`{n}......As the youngest child of the glorious Ushiromiya family, she must have gone through many tough times.`
`So, just as Aunt Eva acted towards me...`
`{n}And just as Sumadera Kasumi is acting right now...`
`{n}......Aunt Rosa must also...have been the same.`
`People push the suffering they have been made to bear onto other people.`
`{n}Otherwise, they can never escape from it.`
`......So on and on, in eternity and perpetuity, the chain of suffering and sadness never ends.`
`That is the reason............Maria onee‐chan's magic was...`
`...so incredible.`
`With her magic, ......she did not have to bear the suffering from Aunt Rosa.`
`That pain was probably pushed onto her.`
`{n}Its weight probably tormented her.`
`......But Onee‐chan did not carry that burden on her own shoulders.`
`.........She exorcised it...and filled her world with happiness.`
`So, I'm sure...`
`...that even if Maria onee‐chan had had children in the future...`
`...she would never have pushed the suffering forced down through the generations onto them.`
`......The chain of suffering and sadness,`
` which had been inherited by and forced upon each generation for who knows how long,`
` .........was, by Maria onee‐chan's magic, broken.`
`"............What is it?`
` Do you have something to complain to me about?"`
`In the past, I would have snapped back.`
`{n}......And cancelled out her hatred with hatred of my own.`
`...No, I cancelled out nothing.`
` The weight of that which had been forced onto her bears down hard on my shoulders as well.`
`After all, even now, ......I hate her.`
`So,`
` ............now that I knew of magic,`
` ......I looked at the human called Ushiromiya Eva again.`
`.........What I could see through to...`
`...was the sad form of a human, no different from me, who had lost her family and who bore deep wounds in her heart.`
`Unable to withstand the pain of that torn heart,`
` she was doing nothing except howling with a sad voice—like a lion crying in pain—like a child.`
`......It turns out...Ushiromiya Eva was also a person deserving of compassion.`
`She had needed someone to understand the difficulties and pain of her childhood days,`
` .........and she, too, as the only survivor of the Rokkenjima incident,`
` who was faced with the inquisitive eyes of all of society, who was publicly slandered, who had salt continually rubbed into her wounds,`
` ......had needed someone's compassion.`
`In order to let her forget her pain and sorrow for least a moment,`
` ............the black witch, the very same that possessed Aunt Rosa, ......taught her magic.`
`It was the same magic of anger and sadness that {f:5:Beatrice} had taught Maria onee‐chan,`
` when she was mourning for Sakutarou after he was torn apart.`
`......That same magic, that witch, had surely dwelled inside Aunt Rosa too.`
`............So I was wrong to hate Ushiromiya Eva.`
`...Perhaps...`
`......I alone was supposed to have become her ally,`
` the only person in the world who could understand her.`
`......What did I say to her when I was young, when she returned alive all alone...?`
`Could it be...`
`......that the way I acted towards her was...`
`......as if she had come back by herself after killing all my family......?`
`...........................`
` ......I can't believe it.`
`...Aunt Eva, who throughout my life has never been more than an object of and synonym for hatred,`
` .........is turning into a...{i:human} who I can understand......`
`And so.`
` .........I looked right next to Aunt Eva, ......at the form of the black witch who taught her the black magic......`
`Aunt Eva...was crying.`
`It was only natural.`
`.........Not only did she have no one who would understand her pain of having lost her husband and son all at once,`
` ......but even I, her only relative, insulted her, ......saying "Give me back my mom and dad".`
`.........I can make the excuse that it was the mercilessness of youth.`
`...But......to her at the time,`
` that was probably cruel enough to sever her heart's last thread.`
`..................In the following days, the talk shows and magazines publicly slandered her.`
`The truths of her late husband's business and character, and even those about her beloved son, were denied.`
`She no longer had anything left.`
`She could do nothing but cry and howl, ......trying to forget the pain and sadness for just a few moments.`
`Because only while howling could she feel the slightest bit of release.`
`And so, .........the black witch taught her how to howl.`
`The one I hated...was the black witch.`
` The black magic probably did release her from that suffering for just a short time.`
`......However,`
` it would never lift that weight from her shoulders.`
`To the contrary, it would force that weight on further victims,`
` .........filling the world with the weight of hatred.`
`...............If Aunt Eva was to have a true witch nearby, one who knew of white magic...`
`......wasn't that...`
`.........supposed to be...`
`...me.........?`
`I had learned the magic to create happiness from Maria onee‐chan.`
`.........If I could have saved her......with that magic,`
` ...............might we not have...`
`......built up a future with a completely different relationship?`
`All this time,`
` .........I have hated Aunt Eva.`
`{n}...So I never noticed the black witch beside her.`
`......Without love, it couldn't be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}.`
`{n}I didn't have...`
`...any love for her......`
`So now, finally...`
`.........I'll glare at the black witch,`
` ......the one I truly should hate.`
`"......Oh?`
` .........What's thiiis?`
` You can {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} me?`
` Ehheheheheh...!"`
`"..................Yes, I can.`
` ......The one I should've hated wasn't Aunt Eva.`
` ......It was you."`
`"Hey, you're pretty good.`
` To think that a lowly {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} could {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} a witch like me.`
` ......And so?`
` Are you trying to say something with that glare?`
` Do you hate me?"`
`"...............Hate?`
` ......Yes, I do.`
` ......But...that's not quite it.`
` ......I just...find you a little sad."`
`"Sad?`
` `
`......*giggle*giggle*, ahhahahahahaha!`
` What're you saying, come on, you can get mad!`
` Why don't you just hate me with all your strength forever?!"`
`"......I won't hate.`
` ......Hating you...`
`......means I'm doing nothing more than inheriting Aunt Eva's hatred.`
` ......I'll break the hatred.`
` ......I'll accept Aunt Eva's suffering, .........exorcise it, and throw it away."`
`"Ahhahahahahahahaha!!`
` What kind of epiphany do you think you've had?`
` Is your head alright?`
` I mean, why don't you just give up and die foreveeeer?!"`
`"Kyaahhahhahahahahahaha!`
` You guys, kick her more and more, okay?`
` Not her face, though.`
` It wouldn't do any good kicking her pitiful face only to make it better!"`
`"Guhhkk!`
` .........*cough*!!`
` ...............g'......"`
`The black‐suits persistently kicked my stomach and back.`
`{n}......As though they had been ordered to by the black witch.`
`"......Dear me, still nothing to you, is it......?`
` ............You keep staring right at me.`
` You hate me?`
` I'll bet you do.`
` I hate you too.`
` *snicker*snicker*snicker*......"`
`Kasumi sneered at me.`
` ......But for some reason, I had the feeling that she was crying behind that expression.`
`She's had a life just as unfair as mine forced upon her, and the pain of that never, ever heals.`
`......The sad lion continues to howl, gasping in pain from the thorn he can't get out...`
`"Hey, Sumadera Kasumi, take a look.`
` That over there is what you used to be."`
`"......Doesn't that make you feel so much better?`
` You used to be standing there, but now you're on this side, you know that?`
` Eheheheh, isn't it delightful?`
` Now the shoe is on the other foot!"`
`"...............Yes, it truly does feel...`
`......delightful.........`
` Ahhahahahaha, how can you make that kind of face, Ange...?!`
` Go on and cry, you want to, right?!"`
`"Kyahhahahahahahaha!!`
` Yes, yes, of course she wants to cry!`
` Go on, make her cry."`
`"You were made to cry back then, weren't you?`
` So make her cry too.`
` *giggle*, and Ange, it's alright, okay?`
` Why not cry foreveeeeeeeer?!`
` Kyaaaha‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"`
`"...Aha, ...ahahahahahahaha!!`
` Cry, Angeee!`
` I want to see your crying face!`
` Cry, and try saying "I'm sorry, Aunt Kasumi"...!!"`
`"Yes, make her say those words.`
` ......Those words hurt, right?`
` Being made to apologize for something that isn't your fault......hurt a lot, didn't it......?"`
`"Make her go through the same thing...`
` By doing that, you can relieve your pain."`
`"......Ehheheheh, yes, that's the way.`
` Be more honest with yourself.`
` Why not spit out your emotions more and more and more foreveeeeeeeer?!"`
`......The black witch stirred Kasumi up.`
`{n}And Kasumi began to give herself over to that dark emotion.`
`......She was doing nothing more than turning her deep sadness into cheap booze and forcing it down,`
` trying to forget for just a brief moment.`
`The words Kasumi insulted me with...`
`......were themselves...`
`...sad.`
`And...I couldn't forgive the black witch for taking advantage of Kasumi's sadness.........`
`.........I had gone limp on the ground, which seemed to have sapped the black‐suits of their enthusiasm for kicking.`
`...Or maybe the kickers had finally gotten tired too.`
`Kasumi hadn't ordered them to stop, but at some point, the violence had halted.`
`However, I was reflected in Kasumi's eyes, and they were burning me with flames of hatred.`
`......She had been tempted by the witch into doing that in order to relieve her own pain.`
`".........Sumadera Kasumi.`
` You aren't done.`
` You've got much more trampling to do.`
` Can you forgive what happened to your entire life with just this little bit of violence?"`
`"...I can't forgive what happened.`
` ......It'll take a lot more than this for me to forgive that."`
`"Right?`
` There's no way you can forgive!`
` Do it more!`
` More of the flames of hatred!`
` Nothing can warm you except the flames of hate.`
` You are freezing in the snow fields of anger and sadness, and the only flame that can warm you up is hatred...!!"`
`"Come on, say it!`
` Scream it!!`
` Why don't you burn yourself to ashes with a roar of hate foreveeeeeeer?!"`
`"U‐......USHIROMIYA ANGEEEEEEEEE!!`
` Loathing you......is what allows me to draw breath!!`
` Ehhehe{0}he{0}ha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"Sumadera Kasumi, that bouquet of flowers.`
` .........These flowers are for your dead family, right, Ange?"`
`The black witch grinned at me unpleasantly, and used her chin to signal Kasumi to pick them up.`
`Kasumi picked up the flowers I was going to offer,`
` .........brought them all the way over to me, dropped them in front of me, and made a show of trampling them...`
`Her expression was filled with hatred, ......and a frantic quality that simple hatred couldn't explain.`
`...It was as if trampling them over and over again was the only way to prevent the sadness inside her from reaching the bursting point.`
`So the sound of her trampling was downright sad.`
`".........Oh, this isn't enough to get to you?`
` Then what about this?`
` Sumadera Kasumi!`
` Use this one."`
`"......N‐.........no......`
` ...Not that........."`
`The object the black witch pointed at.........was Maria onee‐chan's grimoire.`
`Kasumi also noticed it, and picked up that book, which was heavier than it looked...`
`"What's thiiis?"`
`"*giggle*.`
` ......Why not read it and laugh forever?`
` Eheheh, you might split your sides laughing..."`
`Kasumi opened the grimoire,`
` ......skimmed over the contents, and snorted derisively.`
`"Give it back......`
` That's......Onee‐chan's............"`
`Of course, my hand couldn't reach.`
`......My stomach was once again kicked by the black‐suits, and I curled up on the ground...`
`"See?`
` See how important this book is to Ange?`
` Mock the things that are important to her.`
` That works better than punching or kicking for a girl like her.`
` ......You know that better than anyone, right...?"`
`Kasumi's face twisted for an instant, as though remembering something painful.`
`......But that quickly disappeared, changing into a scornful smile directed towards me.`
`"*giggle*giggle*.`
` Wowww, what a freaky book.`
` ......Did you write this.........?"`
`"......Stop it...... Give it back........."`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*!!`
` Look at that face...!`
` Mock it more, mock it more...!`
` Teach her the pain of having your dignity trampled, that's the only way to soften your own pain...!"`
`"Heh, heheheheh, what's with this embarrassing book...`
` ............I know some people develop a little interest in make‐believe fortune telling when they're young girls."`
`"But isn't this taking it a bit too far?`
` Oh god, it says "magic".`
` ......You're one of those, aren't you.`
` You know, that thing in cartoons where they say some "blabbity‐blibbity‐woo" spell and transform into a witch.`
` You're one of those people who like doing that, aren't you?`
` .........This is just painful.`
` *snicker*snicker*."`
`Cackling, Kasumi opened to a random page and showed it to the black‐suits.`
`The black‐suits looked too, and guffawed.`
`That laughter wouldn't wound me.`
`......But I couldn't forgive it.`
` ...After all, that laughter was ridiculing Maria onee‐chan.`
`I don't hate Kasumi.`
` ......For exploiting Kasumi's unhealing anger and sadness, ......I cannot forgive the black witch...`
`That black witch ate into Aunt Eva, Sumadera Kasumi, and Aunt Rosa,`
` ......tormenting them for an eternity without letting their wounds be healed.`
`.........I can't forgive her......`
`{n}......I can't forgive.........the black witch......`
`"Oh my god, this is priceless...!`
` ......Magic for making candy rain from the sky, ......it says!!`
` Ahhaha{0}hahaha...!"`
`"Let's see.`
` Dissolve sugar in cold water purified by the sun...?`
` Dip the magic wand in, and say the incantation, .........*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!`
` What the hell?!`
` Ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!`
` Criiiiiiiiinge!!"`
`The black‐suits also rolled around, guffawing.`
`Then, grinning, the black witch whispered something into Kasumi's ear.`
`......Then, after glaring at me with a grin, ......Kasumi took that page—`
`"......Ah—"`
`Kasumi grabbed hold of that page, tore it out, crumpled it up, ......and threw it away......`
`‘Th‐......that's so mean... ......That was...Maria's magic.........’`
`"Oh, really?`
` Heheh, how sad."`
`......It was one of the magics to summon happiness...`
`...that Maria had made with Sakutarou.`
`Anyone knows that making sugar water, coloring it with paint, and leaving it by the window...`
`...isn't going to make candy rain from the sky.`
`But after repeating that every day, ......one time when she got back from school...`
`...she found several pieces of candy scattered around that place...`
`.........How happy must that miracle have made Maria onee‐chan.`
`......What good care she must have taken of those candies, savoring them during her nights all alone with Sakutarou, to distract herself from her loneliness.`
`That......magic which Onee‐chan had created...`
`......was torn out, thrown away,`
` ...and disappeared......`
`The entire miracle of happiness created by that magic,`
` ......she tore out and threw away......`
`"Oh, this one's another classic...!`
` Magic to make dinner be cream croquettes?`
` Ahhaha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!`
` ......What's this next one?`
` Magic to make bell peppers taste nice?`
` This is amazing, ridiculous!`
` Ah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah...!!"`
`"Tear that too.`
` Eheheh!!`
` Why not tear it more and more foreveeeeeer?!?!"`
`With a cruel‐hearted, loud laugh,`
` ......the black witch made her tear out Maria onee‐chan's magics one after another......`
`She...sneered at those happy magics,`
` ......ripped them out,`
` ......and threw them away......`
`"Stop it... Stop it......!!`
` Don't......defile Lady {f:5:Maria}'s magic...!!`
` Don't defile it......with your filthy toxin...!!"`
`Mammon cried and yelled, ......but she had no way of reaching Kasumi.`
`"Who cares, why don't you just be defiled foreveeeer?!`
` Magical miracles?`
` Magic to bring happiness?`
` Doesn't exist, there's no such thing!"`
`"Pain and suffering, you see, can only be healed by pushing them onto someone else.`
` ......Now you, you were what they call a "magic friend", right?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Sumadera Kasumi, open up to her page."`
`"What's this?`
` Magic friends, it says.`
` ............The Seven Sisters of Purgatory?"`
`"Ahah, what a creepy name!`
` *giggle*, it says they can fly at awesome speeds, and finish off the enemy for you.`
` Ahhaha, Ange, if you can use this kind of magic, shouldn't you use it right now?`
` .........Ahhaha{0}hahaha.`
` Stupid!"`
`The pages that wrote of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory were also heartlessly torn away.`
`......The pages themselves were just paper.`
`{n}They weren't Mammon's vessel or anything.`
`But the tearing, denying toxin burned Mammon from the inside......`
`Mammon's face twisted from the heat and pain...`
`".........ghhh, ...............kkkhhh, ........."`
`‘Are you okay, Mammon?!`
` Hang in there......!!’`
`"......I can......handle it...`
` ......It's not me......but Ange‐sama.........who's in pain........."`
`However, Mammon's expression was twisted in unbearable pain and humiliation......`
`‘Stop it, black witch......!!`
` Why are you doing something like this?!`
` Why......can't you use magic for happiness?!!’`
`"......Oh, you're a magic friend too, right?`
` *giggle*, I'll defile you too.`
` Sumadera Kasumi, look for this guy's page, too."`
`"What's this one?`
` What's with this crappy scribble of a lion?`
` ......Sakutarou?`
` What a weird name!`
` My best friend, it says.`
` Really?`
` This is your friend? Your close friend?`
` This lion is? Is it, is it?"`
`"Ahhahahahahahaha!!`
` It really is a crappy scribble.`
` So this butt‐ugly lion is you."`
`"To think she had something like this as a friend... That Ushiromiya Maria kid's mind is so unbelievably wretched my sides are hurting.`
` .........What a morrrrron.`
` Why not give up and die foreveeeeeer......?"`
`‘U...ryu......`
` .........Don't make fun......of Maria......’`
`"...............St......op......it.........`
` ...Don't rip it........."`
`""No waay.""`
`There was a shrill tearing sound.`
` .........And the page was filthily ripped out...`
`The picture of Sakutarou...`
`...that Onee‐chan had drawn...`
`...was violently ripped in half.........`
`"What a shhhhhitty drawi~ng.`
` Kyahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!"`
`"You all laugh too.`
` Aahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!"`
`Obeying the pair, the black‐suits laughed crudely,`
` ......and heartlessly trampled all over the paper that had been torn and thrown away......`
`‘Uuuuuuuuuuuu, ......hic!`
` ......Uuuuuuuuuuu......’`
`"......Sakutaro, ......be strong........."`
`‘I'm...not sad......`
` ...I just......can't stand it......`
` ......Maria's being made fun of,`
` .........and I can't do anything about it...`
` ......I can't stand it......’`
`"........................`
` ......To {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s who can't {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} us, ......it's as though we don't exist...`
` ......We can only interact with {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s that need us.`
` ............That's why.........we're furniture........."`
`As Sakutarou and Mammon......supported each other,`
` ......they slumped down, ...sobbing...`
`I couldn't stand it either......`
` ......Only those who can {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} the world of magic can understand how wonderful it is.`
`It can't be explained to humans who can't understand.`
` And so it is mocked.`
`{n}.........If only you could show it...`
`......But you can't......`
`Because, in front of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s who are filled with the anti‐magic toxin and who can't understand magic,`
` .........magic cannot be used......`
`"I really don't get it.`
` From this delusional diary, I've got to assume that something's wrong with your head.`
` ......It really is interesting to take a peek into your happy‐go‐lucky little mind.`
` You creepy child."`
`"You and Maria.`
` ......And that stuffed animal and the furniture over there too.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!`
` Ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!"`
`"Aah, I could laugh.`
` You don't have any friends, do you?`
` You're allllways all alone, and stuffed animals are your friends, right?`
` What a pitiable child."`
`"Ehheheheheheheheheh...!`
` Don't worry, I understand.`
` I know what it's like to live that way.`
` .........So I'll be the one to recognize you for what you are.`
` You really are a pitiful little child.`
` Ehhehehha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!"`
`.........So, to you,`
` ......she looks like a pitiful child.`
`Yes, I'm sure she does.`
`If a hundred people were to read Onee‐chan's diary and grimoire, all one hundred would probably get that same impression.`
`......I used to be one of them.`
`But you know,`
` .........in spite of all that,`
` ......Maria onee‐chan...`
`...still called this a world of happiness.`
`.........Don't deny...`
`......that magic, ...that happiness......`
`"Such a stubborn child, you are.`
` ......Alright, fine.`
` This is the last one.`
` I'll tear apart the source of the absolutely ridiculous magic that you and Maria believed in.`
` Sumadera Kasumi, read this page."`
`"Hmmm, what is this colorful page......?`
` ...Let's see.`
` .........Magic to...`
`...always be friends with Mama who I love...?"`
`‘N‐noooooooooo!!`
` Not that page......!!’`
`"Oh?`
` This magic is really simple.`
` I think even I could do it without any practice at all.`
` .........Even I can remember an incantation this short.`
` Shall I give it a go?"`
`"*giggle*giggle*, it really is a short incantation, isn't it?`
` Alright, give it a try, let's all burst it out!"`
`With expressions that ridiculed it from the bottoms of their hearts, the black witch and Kasumi......puckered their lips in the most exaggerated way they could,`
` ............and said it aloud......`
`"Uu‐uu."`
`The black‐suits stared blankly, asking what that was supposed to be.`
`{n}Then Kasumi answered, cackling.`
`"This is supposed to be the "incantation".`
` Are you kidding me...!`
` Ahhahahahahahaha...!!!"`
`"Come on, why don't you guys try it too?`
` Uu‐uu‐uu."`
`The black‐suits imitated that moaning voice, making fun of it......`
`{m:-5:———}—“Uu‐uu.”`
`{n}That was the incantation...for the magic that would let her always be friends with the mama she loved.`
`"What is this stupidity...!!`
` If you could make family relationships better just by saying "uu‐uu", we would have world peace forever.`
` Ahah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!!"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!`
` A stupid moaning voice!`
` If you do this over and over again, people are going to think you're a poor kid with mental problems!`
` Are you retarrrrrded?!`
` Waaahahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha, waaaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`‘Stoooooop...... At least don't mock......that magiiiiiiiic......’`
`............One day when Maria onee‐chan and Aunt Rosa had gone on a picnic together.`
`It was written that this was one of the five happiest days of her life.`
`And Onee‐chan was singing her mama a song that she had just learned from her.`
`......Onee‐chan was happy to see that her mama was enjoying it very much.`
` But partway through, she forgot the lyrics.`
`But her mama was enjoying it so much, so she tried to sing until the very end.`
`With "uu‐uu‐uu".`
`......She sung it with fake lyrics, but her mama was very pleased......`
`After that, "uu" remained as an incantation to remember that day she had spent in fun and happiness with her mama.`
`Of course, even though Aunt Rosa thought it funny at first, eventually she tired of hearing it,`
` and later on, started to scold Onee‐chan whenever she said it,`
` ......but to Onee‐chan, it was a memory of a fun day that she could never forget......`
`So among the magics that Maria created, it was the oldest and the first......`
`Kasumi stuck her fingernails into that page too......`
`"......Stop,`
` ............don't tear it......`
` At least spare...`
`......that page........."`
`"Ehheheheheheheheheh!`
` No waay!!"`
`............With a shrill sound, a girl's world of happiness...`
`was...`
`erased.`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!`
` Aaaa‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah, aaaaahah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!`
` Is this your magic of happiness?`
` Hilarious, hilarious...!!"`
`"Why would you ever think that magic could make people happy?!`
` Magic—listen now—is made of...anger...and hatred!"`
`"Happiness is what you call the feeling of release you get only when you've pushed all of the hatred you bear onto someone else.`
` The happiness you all are talking about is a phantom that doesn't show up outside picture books!!"`
`As Kasumi laughed her head off, she slammed the grimoire against the ground, and stepped on it.`
`"Can't stand it?`
` Well? Can't stand it?!`
` You white witches of happiness?`
` If you can't stand it that much, why don't you show us?!`
` Show us your magic!!"`
`"If it exists, then you just have to use it and show us, riiiiight?`
` .........A witch that can't use magic isn't a witch!!`
` So we are the real witches.`
` You're just brats trying to escape reality with a dream of magic!!"`
`...............Then,`
` .........if I can show you magic, ......will you...`
`......believe in Onee‐chan's magic.........?`
`"Huh?`
` Kyahhahahaha, oh yes, oh yes!!`
` I'll believe!`
` If you {i:can} use magic and show me, that i~s!!`
` Go on then, do it, you shit‐for‐brains little braaaaaat!!"`
`...........................`
` .........`
`Silently, slowly,`
` ......I stood up.`
` ......The sensations of this small world, such as the pain in my body, felt truly insignificant......`
`"Oh, looks like you've still got enough energy to stand up, Miss Great Witch?`
` *snicker*snicker*!"`
`"Now that you've stood up, what are you going to show us?`
` Go on, show us your magiiic...!"`
`".....................Magic...exists."`
`"Whaa?`
` What's this kid coming out with now...?!`
` Did you guys hear that?!"`
`"Quiet!!!`
` ............Heh, isn't that interesting.`
` ...You people have always declined to show this power of miracles because of the anti‐magic toxin.`
` .........Disciple of the white witch {f:5:Maria}.`
` Try showing me magic...!!"`
`"..........................."`
`"......Do you have any clue how many humans have believed in that miracle and been betrayed?"`
`".........*giggle*.`
` Every one of them believed!`
` Every one of them was betrayed and despaired!`
` And they all learn that true magic can only be gained by the power of black witches like me...!!"`
`"...............Taking your hatred out on someone else is nothing more than a crime.`
` That isn't magic.`
` .........I'll show you what real magic is."`
`"...............Y‐you..............."`
`The black witch winced slightly.`
`{n}However, Kasumi sneered at me even more.`
`"Show me, then.`
` So? What kind of magic are you going to show me?`
` Magic to make candy rain from the sky?`
` Or else magic to make cookies multiply?"`
`"............Wagh?!"`
`The instant I opened my eyes, a tremendous wind arose.`
`"Wh‐......what is this, all of a sudden.........?!"`
`"Come, arise, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory."`
`".........Whaaat......"`
`There was a flash behind me, and in an instant, seven high‐level furniture were gathered there.`
`{n}It was a power that far surpassed the magical power I'd had in my prime.`
`{n}It was a power that matched even Maria onee‐chan and {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`"The Seven Sisters of Purgatory, right here...!!"`
`"......A‐Ange‐sama......!"`
`"You said it once.`
` ......Because I lacked magical power and resolve,`
` ......I could not use you or your sisters.`
` ............This isn't some cheap emotion, like wanting to get back at my bullying classmates."`
`"...In order to protect Maria onee‐chan's, .........Mariage Sorcière's world,`
` ......I now order you to show me the miracle of magic."`
`"I‐it's impossible...`
` There's just no way, not with such a mass of toxin in front of us........."`
`The Seven Sisters also remembered what had once happened in that classroom.`
`{n}......If they could have obeyed Ange's order, they would have.`
`......However, ......surrounded by the toxin that runs thick in {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, they hadn't been able to display the miracle of magic.`
`......And they remembered very well how deeply that had hurt Ange......`
`But Ange spoke very quietly.`
`"In that case.`
` You all believe too."`
`"......Huh?"`
`"............Mariage Sorcière was created to make people happy.`
` ...And also to fight the black witch."`
`"The foolish black witch denies the world created by one of the founders, the Witch of Origins, Lady {f:5:Maria}.`
` ......In order to show her that miracle,`
` ......and in order to protect that world,`
` .........believe.`
` In magic.`
` In witches.`
` Right now—in the miracle...!"`
`Kasumi gave an order to the black‐suits, and one of them took out a gun and pointed it at Ange.`
`"You're going to show us magic, right?`
` Then show us, if you would.`
` Use magic to shoot this man down with a fireball or lightning or something."`
`"You get one chance.`
` .........Show us before I count to three, alright?`
` If you can't, then you had best prepare yourself, okay?`
` Ehheheheheh!"`
`"...........................`
` ..................Shoot me."`
`"What's with this kid.`
` Hehheheh, she's fuckin' crazy."`
`The black‐suit pointing the gun laughed at Ange's composure.`
`"Ahhahahahahaha!!`
` Are you serious?!`
` This girl's living in cloud cuckoo land!`
` In that case, get yourself shot! Why don't you just die foreveeeeeeer?!"`
`‘Ange...!!`
` ......I‐it's impossible!`
` You can't block bullets with magic......!!’`
`"No.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of.`
` ............To my magic, to the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, bullets are like nothing."`
`"A‐Ange‐sama........."`
`Mammon was flustered by Ange's absolute trust.`
`{n}......She would have loved to live up to that trust, if only she could.`
` On that day as well.`
`But, ......she had been unable to do anything, and she had hurt Ange.........`
`"Hehheheh, you little shit.`
` You can use magic, huh? Then goddamn show us already."`
`"What's the hold up?`
` Show us some magic, right now!!"`
`"Come on, no need to hold back!`
` Shazow!`
` Blast me with some magic, I dare ya!!`
` Hihhehhehheh!"`
`The black‐suits jeered at her.`
`{n}But Ange simply concentrated her mind in silence......`
`"Why not just shoot and kill her forever?!`
` She's even telling you to shoot her!"`
`"......This kid's already lost her mind from fear.`
` Bye‐bye, Ange‐chan.`
` ......Go and play witches as much as you want in heaven.`
` ......Shoot her."`
`"Heheh, you sure?"`
`"Shoot!`
` Die, Ange!!"`
`"Magic it up, brat, if you can!!!"`
`The black‐suit cocked the gun, and, sneering, he...pulled the trigger.`
`"................................."`
`A gunshot rang out,`
` .........and the world...stopped.`
`A red spray scattered,`
` .........and chunks of flesh flew.`
`"...uh, ...............ah......"`
`"What are you doing, Mammon?`
` ......You would let this boorish pebble of a bullet reach Ange‐sama?"`
`Lucifer had lined up the bullet perfectly, and with a single swing, ......had sliced it in two......`
`And......in the chest of the black‐suit who had apparently fired the gun......there was a hole as big as a fist...`
`".........Every once in a while,`
` it's alright for me to go first, right?"`
`Half of Leviathan's body was covered with blood, and she wore a cold smile.`
`......Then, slowly, .........the pitiful prey that she had brought down...fell over.`
`"Y‐......you pierced...a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}......!!!"`
`"Idiot!`
` Do you still not believe?!`
` In our master's magic power...!!"`
`"Are......you...kidding me.........?!?!`
` You ma‐manifested...in front of this many {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s?!?!"`
`"Wh‐.........what the...what?!"`
`Kasumi and the rest were thrown into confusion...`
`He certainly seemed to have fired the gun......`
`{n}However,`
` ......it hadn't hit Ange,`
` .........and why...`
`...was the person who fired...`
`...instead......?!`
`"......This is...magic.`
` ......Great job, Leviathan."`
`"I am most honored...!!`
` You foolish {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s who dare oppose our master!`
` Now is the time of judgment! Prostrate yourselves!!"`
`"H‐how......?!!!`
` You shouldn't be able to bring magic into the world of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s...!!`
` They shouldn't be able to {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} magic, they shouldn't be able to be touched by magic!!`
` ......How?!!"`
`"............Because this...is true magic."`
`"...... ......aaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAA...!!"`
`"Wh‐what are you people doing?!`
` K‐kill her, kill her!!!"`
`One of the black‐suits who had finally come to his senses pulled his gun, aimed,`
`"Did you think I'd overlook the disrespect of pointing a gun at our master......?`
` Die."`
`Those words were his funeral.`
` ......The man had already been struck through the chest by Lucifer, who had become the Stake of Pride in an instant.`
`Thump!`
` The sound of the second person falling brought it home to the black‐suits that their lives were unmistakably in peril...!!`
`"Aaa...waaaaaaaagggh!! Hel‐hel‐heeeeelllllp......!!!"`
`Almost paralyzed with fright, the man turned on his heels in an attempt to escape from that place,`
` ......and in that instant, the Stake of Sloth......`
`"............Be thankful that this is the only recompense for your violence against our master.`
` Die!!"`
`A hole as big as a walnut opened in his right eye, and his head split.`
`Belphegor was sprayed with blood, and her face twisted demonically with the joy of being able to use her full power...!`
`"Ahh...waaaaaaagghhh?!`
` Who?!`
` Who's there?!`
` Where are you?!"`
`The black‐suits panicked, pointing their guns in every direction.`
`{n}But they didn't understand what was happening.`
`They only knew that something terrifying was coming for them from somewhere,`
` but they didn't know where...!!`
`"Idiots!!`
` Th‐the enemy is right in front of you!`
` The witch's furniture is after you!!!"`
`But they could not {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see}...!!`
`{n}Because they couldn't believe in magic, they could not {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see}...!!`
`Just as the black witch said, Satan was standing boldly right in front of the black‐suit.`
`However, the black‐suit couldn't {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} that at all...!`
`"*giggle*...!`
` You think {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s could see our forms?`
` Perceive us?`
` Ahhahahahahahaha, you stupid {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s!!`
` Time to pay your foolish compensation for forgetting your awe of magic!!"`
`"H‐hieeiiiiiie!!!`
` What is this?!`
` What's going on?!"`
`".........You cannot {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see}.`
` Because you have no love."`
`"......Impossible!!`
` There are so many {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s here, the anti‐magic toxin is everywhere...... How can you manifest your magic?!`
` What...are you?!?!"`
`"............A witch.`
` And unlike you, a real one."`
`"Khhh... Wrraa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aagghhh, damn youu{-}u{-}u{-}uuu, you biii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iitch!!"`
`As though announcing his candidacy for the fourth victim, one of the black‐suits pointed his gun at Ange.`
`......And pulled the......`
`Ange glared at him coldly, and simply ordered.`
`"F‐fucking diiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeee!!"`
`"Next.`
` Satan."`
`"Satan the Wrathful, already right here!!"`
`"Slowpoke!!`
` You think a simple bullet could hit Ange‐sama or any of us now?!!!"`
`The Stake of Wrath......pierced and smashed the bullet fired by the black‐suit,`
` and continued straight on, towards the man's face—`
`".........Know your foolishness, and regret it in hell!!`
` Die!!"`
`With a terrible explosive sound, the upper half of the man's head was smashed.`
`Bathed in scattered flesh and blood, Ange quietly asked one more time.`
`"...So, Aunt Kasumi.`
` .........Do you still...`
`not feel like believing in magic?"`
`"Th‐`
`this is crazy...`
` ......This can't be real...!!`
` I, I won't accept it...!!`
` There's no way magic is real......!!!"`
`"Yes, that's right...`
` There's no way magic exists...!!`
` There's no way witches exist!!"`
`‘Ma‐......magic exists!!`
` Witches exist......!! Uryuu!!’`
`".........Yes.`
` Magic exists.`
` Witches exist.`
` ......And in this world filled with anger and sadness, you can make them into the key that opens the door to a world of happiness...!!`
` I won't let someone like you......deny that!!"`
`‘Everyone holds the key to a world of happiness in the palm of their hand...!`
` And no one......has any right to steal that away......!!’`
`"You poor {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, who cannot understand this...`
` .........If there had been magic in your life, it would surely have been very different, and much more peaceful."`
`"Not once in your entire life were you ever able to meet with a true witch, and for this,`
` ......I pity you."`
`"Eee......eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekkk!!!"`
`Kasumi let out a piercing scream.`
`At the same time, the two remaining black‐suits came for me at once, and thrusted their guns against my head.`
`......Like they were trying to use me as a hostage against something their eyes couldn't {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see}.`
`.........Against the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, high‐level furniture who had now reached the level of weapons, this was completely and totally pointless.`
`"Dammit, where are you?!`
` You don't stop attacking, and this bitch is dead!!`
` Show yourself!!"`
`"Kyahhahahahahahaha!!!`
` What's this guy on about?! And his guts look so tasty too.`
` .........Ange‐sama, leave the next one to me!"`
`"Go ahead. Kill him."`
`"I am so {i:very} grateful...!!`
` Diiiiiee!!!"`
`The man's chest split, and his guts poured out.`
` ......This terrible way of dying threw the other man into a total panic.`
`However, Asmodeus's form was already at his back,`
` embracing his neck with her arm, ......and smiling obscenely......`
`"What a cute kid.`
` ......Hey, where do you want me to pierce you?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, Ange‐sama, do you have any preference?!!!"`
`"Head."`
`"Certainly, my masteeeer!!`
` Die!!"`
`The final black‐suit had his head smashed by the Stake of Lust,`
` and as his insides scattered, he twisted and fell.`
`In that gruesome world where six people lay in a sea of blood,`
` .........witch and {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} confronted each other.`
`".........Sumadera Kasumi.`
` I sympathize with your pitiable life from the bottom of my heart.`
` ......I can give you magic to seal up that unfillable hole in your heart.`
` If you will believe in that magic, that is."`
`"D‐don't be so......ridiculous......!!`
` This, this is, ...I won't accept it!!`
` Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekk!!"`
`As Kasumi slowly retreated backwards, scared out of her wits,`
` .....she picked up a handgun that someone had dropped.`
`Then, shaking, she pointed it at Ange...`
`"That's right, Kasumi...!`
` Shoot her with that gun...!!`
` Turn your hatred into a bullet and shoot...!!"`
`"Hiee...hiie...!!`
` I'll kill you... I'll kill you...!!`
` If I don't kill you, my life will go unrewarded......!!"`
`"Yes, kill her!`
` Pull the trigger!!`
` Take all of the anger and pain from your shabby life until now!!`
` Use it all against her!"`
`"If you don't, you won't be released from your pain and anguish!!"`
`"............Stop it, Aunt Kasumi.`
` ......You mustn't lend an ear to the black witch."`
`"I'll kill you...... I'll kill you......!`
` Because of your mother,`
` ......my entire life...`
`...has been a wreck......!!"`
`"Then maybe, starting now bit by bit, you can turn that life into something bright and peaceful, with my magic.`
` If you simply believe in magic and have a change of heart,`
` it can open the door to a new world for you."`
`"There's no such thing!!`
` The salvation she speaks of is obviously just some fairy tale!"`
`"Your life is already covered with thorns until you die...!!`
` Let her hear your cries of agony!!`
` You can't regain anything that was lost... Right? Sumadera Kasumiiiiiiiiii?!?!"`
`"Yes, you might not be able to regain anything.`
` But I'm sure you can create something new.`
` So, Aunt Kasumi.`
` Throw that gun away.`
` .........I might be able to teach you of a world of happiness too."`
`"Hiee...`
`......hiie...hieeiii......!!`
` You,`
` .........you don't know......!!`
` Because your mother ran away,`
` .........I was forced to marry her fiancé as a substitute...!!"`
`"You know I had a man who promised to spend his life with me?!`
` You know I was forced to break up with him?!`
` You think you understand how I felt when I was made to wed in your mother's place,`
` ......and was forced to consummate the marriage with a man I had barely even talked to?!?!"`
`"I wanted to kill her!!`
` But Nee‐san just went and died on her own!`
` That's why I'm going to kill you!!`
` Otherwise, my thorn‐covered life will never eeeeeeeend!!"`
`......From Kasumi's eyes,`
` frenzied tears dripped down.`
`This poor woman...`
` ......Even she had such clear and beautiful tears.`
`But for that very reason, ......she hadn't been able to withstand her sad pain,`
` and had had no choice but to listen to the black witch's temptation...`
`"..................I feel so sorry for you.`
` ......In that case, the least I can do is to forever release you and your soul from the bonds of resentment.`
` .........That might be the only bit of charity I can give you now."`
`"Diiiiiiiiiiiee, Ushiromiya Angeeeeeeeeeee!!!"`
`"Goodbye, Aunt Kasumi.`
` .........Take a long rest in a quiet world."`
`I no longer feel any anger or hatred towards you.`
`{n}I just want...`
`to let your soul rest in peace.`
`Kasumi's handgun spat fire.`
`Slowly, that bullet continued through a world frozen to the utmost limit, ......making its way towards {f:5:Ange}'s forehead.`
`"Mammon."`
`"......Y‐......yes!!`
` Mammon the Covetous, right here...!!"`
`"Thanks."`
`"......Huh?"`
`"It was because I met you and Sakutarou that I was able to understand everything."`
`‘......Ange......’`
`"Look away, Sakutarou.`
` .........Mammon.`
` Release that woman.`
` And...protect the honor of Mariage Sorcière...!!"`
`"Ye‐.........yes!!`
` ......Prepare yourself, Sumadera Kasumi!!"`
`Even though the world was frozen, the Stake of Greed flashed like lightning,`
` .........and was already through Kasumi and out the other side...`
`"If you possess the slightest virtue, you shall have an audience again on the mountain of Purgatory!!`
` .........Diiiiiiiieee!!!"`
`The upper half of Sumadera Kasumi's head shattered.`
`......Her cage of flesh was broken,`
` ......and she was finally released......`
`".........And now...it's just you.`
` ...........The black witch.`
` ......At this point, I feel bad for even seeing a resemblance to Aunt Eva in you."`
`"Heh, ......heheheheheh.`
` ...If my form still looks like Ushiromiya Eva,`
` that means you still haven't been able to forgive "me" inside yourself."`
`"I understand, Ange.`
` ............You also want to be released from your thorn‐covered life more than anything."`
`"...................................."`
`"In that case, ......I've thought of something interesting.`
` I'll show you magic as well.`
` .........I won't be the one to kill you."`
`With the worst smile on her face,`
` the black witch changed her form into something like a black mist,`
` ...or else a vast swarm of black flying insects, which began to swirl around me.`
`Then that black mist began to amass bit by bit, ......shaping itself into the form of a human.`
`".....................What's this supposed to be......"`
`Ehheheheheh!`
` I think you know very well what!`
`That woman you hated and despised the most!`
`And that woman hated and despised you the most as well...!`
`When the black mist cleared,`
` .........over there was...`
`.........Aunt Eva's form,`
` ......as she had been while alive.`
`......In her hands...she was holding a gun.`
`"...............Aunt Eva...`
`...died."`
`"*giggle*, long time no see, Angeeee.`
` ......I've returned from hell to kill youu!`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`Aunt Eva glared at me, laughing madly.`
`"But......I'm not that surprised.`
` Aunt Eva was that kind of person."`
`"I imagine my funeral cleared your mood up quite a bit, didn't it?`
` It did for me too, because it meant that I never have to see your face again...!`
` But I did have just one regret.`
` And this is it!!"`
`".........Killing me?`
` ............Was that your last request?"`
`How pitiful.`
` ......Even after death,`
` ......Aunt wasn't released from her suffering......`
`"It was the black witch's power that was the source of my magic.`
` Anger and hatred taught me how to work hard and persist.`
` Completely different from the escapist magic that you speak of!"`
`"......The magic you speak of is nothing more than stress reduction through outbursts of anger.`
` ......Our magic is different.`
` It can remake the entire world.`
` .........It's of a completely different class than your ill‐natured magic."`
`"*snicker*!!`
` In that case, I'll settle it here, once and for all—which comes out on top, black or white...!!`
` By my black magic, I have performed a miracle that has allowed me to revive and point a gun at you like this, even after death.`
` With what kind of miracle will your white magic fight back?"`
`"I have taken you in amongst the anti‐magic toxin.`
` You won't be able to call the Seven Sisters any more.`
` That miracle just now won't occur again...!!"`
`"...............But it will, regardless—that's the reason it's called magic.`
` ......Alright.`
` Mammon. Lend me your power."`
`......But Mammon didn't respond.`
` She didn't appear.`
`Certainly, as she said,`
` the anti‐magic toxin had burned everything up like a wasteland parched by a blazing sun...`
`.........This might be a little tough.`
`"It's useless to call out.`
` Never again...`
`will the Seven Sisters of Purgatory answer you!"`
`"Like I said.`
` I can call them anyway... That's what makes it magic, right?"`
`"........................`
` ......You're a sad child, Ange.`
` So long.`
` The simple days we spent together were reasonably fun.`
` This is goodbye.`
` ......It must be nice for you that this was your final stop."`
`"Yeah, totally.`
` That's very thoughtful of you."`
`"Thanks.`
` Then this is farewell."`
`The barrel of the gun rose slowly,`
` ......so that you could see all the way down it.`
`And,`
` .........the trigger was slowly.........`
`Then,`
` ......there was a loud bang from the gun.`
`...Not in the sense that it fired.`
` ......It {i:exploded}.`
`............You're...kidding me......`
`......In shock, inside frozen space,`
` ......Eva looked at the exploded gun.`
`When time unfroze, the fragments would probably smash into her face all at once...`
`"......Mammon the Covetous.`
` Right here."`
`".....................You're...kidding me..."`
`Behind Eva's back, Mammon stood.`
` .........She had already penetrated the target I had given her.`
` ......Which was...the gun.`
`"Is this......enough magic for you?`
` ............Aunt Eva."`
`"......A‐`
`.........Angeee........."`
`Then, time unfroze.`
`{n}Fragments of the ruptured gun and gunpowder gas burned her face.`
`{n}Letting out a shrill scream, she rolled around covering her face......`
`......It was pitiful.`
`"......Unlucky.`
` ......This is game over.`
` Aunt Eva."`
`I signaled to Mammon.`
` ...To free Eva quickly from her pain as she writhed around with her burnt face.`
`"............Thank you, Mammon.`
` ...I'd like to apologize again, now, from the bottom of my heart, for calling all of you powerless on that day in the classroom.`
` You were excellent furniture for protecting witches."`
`".........It is I who should be grateful.`
` ......I feel truly honored to have been able to meet a good witch and a good master in the end, and to have had the opportunity to fulfill my duty as furniture...!"`
`Mammon understood.`
`{n}This would be the final job I would ever give her.`
`Mammon quietly walked close.`
`{n}Then, she looked down upon her.`
`"......Aunt Eva.`
` Thank you for sticking with me until today.`
` This is farewell.`
` <Have a nice dream>.`
` <See you in hell>."`
`"<Cool>."`
`Then, ......the light sound of her forehead being perforated rang out.`
`......The battle of gunpowder smoke, delirium, ......and white and black magic...was over.`
`It felt like it had been a long, .........truly long journey.`
`{n}And the world slowly...`
`...sank into darkness.........`
`The stars that should be sparkling.........lay not in the sky, but were scattered beneath me.`
`......When I recognized that the pearls and rubies were creating a river of white and red,`
` I realized that it was a vast nighttime scene that was spread out below me...`
`I was in the sky of that nighttime scene, neither standing nor flying,`
` ......but simply floating in the air.`
`......From nowhere in particular, I could hear the sound of one person clapping—`
`a truly dull applause.`
`I understood.`
` ......It was the one who ordered me to go on this journey,`
` ......{f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`"...............Congratulations,`
` Endless Witch, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}.`
` At the end of your travels, you understood everything about magic."`
`"......Yes.`
` .........I now...understand everything about magic.`
` .........I am...a witch.`
` ......The last witch who inherited the magical world created by Mariage Sorcière."`
`".........No one besides you...can tear {f:5:Beatrice}'s world to pieces."`
`"And it was through coming to know magic.........that I learned also how to resist it."`
`"................................."`
`"......Magic is made of love and sadness and anger.`
` ......No matter how cruel a witch {f:5:Beatrice} might have been,`
` the source of her magic is exactly the same."`
`".........And that's why, honestly, I wish I could leave that world of hers alone.`
` ......After all, in her eyes at least, that world is complete as it is."`
`"............But then you'd have to give up on your family."`
`".....................`
` ......That's right.`
` So, although I feel bad about it, I have to fight.`
` .........Because the very reason I left on this journey to become a witch...`
`...was so that I could bet on the small probability that I could take my family back."`
`"Unless you kill {f:5:Beatrice}, only worlds of isolation can exist for you.`
` ......As one who has traveled through billions of fragments, I can guarantee it."`
`"............I understand.`
` ......I don't have room for compassion.`
` ......I must make my heart a demon,`
` .........and tear her heart to pieces."`
`"......It is good that you are steady in your resolve.`
` I was worried that, as another witch like her, you might grow attached and lose your will to continue."`
`Coming from a person like her, whose face was almost always expressionless, those words felt a bit hollow.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` ......The enigmatic witch who invited me on this journey.`
`{n}....................................`
`"There were moments when I suspected that you might have been lying to me."`
`".....................Why?"`
`"......I am the Ange of 1998, so even if I save my family, that will only bring relief to the Ange of 1986.`
` ......It won't do anything for me.`
` So I sometimes felt like I was being deceived."`
`"........................`
` ......That is correct.`
` I deceived you."`
`"......But now I'm grateful.`
` .........After all,`
` in the end, you did teach me the way to take my family back."`
`"............I didn't teach you anything.`
` ......If you have come to know that, it's a state of understanding that you reached on your own as a witch.`
` That place you have reached is different from mine.`
` .........I myself cannot comprehend it, but if it is as you say, then congratulations."`
`"I am not a player in this game, but a piece.`
` You said this to me, right?"`
`"............Yes, I did."`
`"Now, I fully understand that role.`
` ...............A piece doesn't need emotions.`
` It just has to give its all for the sake of victory."`
`"............Yes.`
` That's exactly right.`
` A game is where you each make the best possible move, right?`
` If you allow your moves to get distorted by hesitation and indecision, your opponent will be confused as well."`
`..................Sorry, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`But...don't hold it against me.`
`{n}......“Ushiromiya Ange” still needs her family.`
`So I have the right to fight you...so that I can take them back.`
`And you have the responsibility to accept my challenge.`
`.........So please...don't hold it against me.`
`In exchange...`
`if you do win in this game,`
` I'll give you my blessing as well.`
`Now, let's go.`
` .........As the piece I am, it's finally time for my true turn.`
`Sorry, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{e:120:I can't hand Onii‐chan over to you...!!!}`
`The world whitened......`
`It wasn't "white".`
` ...It was the blindingly bright color of gold.`
`That place......was the beautiful Ushiromiya family rose garden.`
`However, the roses were all gold.`
`......The nectar was also golden.`
` The butterflies gathering there were gold as well.`
`............This is...the Golden Land............`
`The promised land that the witches of Mariage Sorcière would ultimately be guided to...`
`There, all wishes come true, and all magic and dreams come into being.`
`............In that garden of gold roses...`
`............were two, and only two, witches.`
`At my uninvited appearance,`
` the atmosphere trembled with unrest.`
`.........What was to them an ominous wind shook the golden roses.`
`The incredibly beautiful scene formed by the golden rose petals scattering in the wind...`
`was, without a doubt, something not of this world......`
`The two who had been taking a walk through the golden roses noticed me and reacted in surprise.`
`"......Ange......?`
` .........Beato, it's Ange......!!"`
`"...............How did you get here...?`
` .........Leave us alone.`
` I no longer invite anyone here."`
`Beato spoke coldly.`
` .........She seemed like a completely different person from the boldly sneering woman she had once been.`
`She had closed off her heart, and shut herself up in a world where she was alone with Maria onee‐chan.`
`A world where she could always be alone with friendly Maria onee‐chan,`
` conversing about magic while drinking tea.`
`......No one to hurry them, and nothing to hold them back.`
`A world where not a single person who might hurt them existed.`
`Yes, to the two of them, that was a small and complete universe......`
`".........Sorry.`
` ......I can't have you shutting yourself up in here.`
` .........The game won't move on unless you come back."`
`"I said I was tired of it and I'm done with it.`
` I will not return to the game anymore."`
`"...............Beato is going to be here all the time with me.`
` We'll drink tea here together, and think of lots of ways to play...!`
` You can play with us too, Ange."`
`"......{f:5:Maria}.`
` We decided against that.`
` As long as I have you, I am satisfied.`
` Tell me that you too are satisfied as long as you have me."`
`".....................`
` ......Yeah.`
` ......Thank you.`
` The only person who needs me that much is you, Beato.`
` So I'll be with you.`
` Just us is enough."`
`".........{f:5:Maria}...... ......Thank you......`
` ............I am grateful........."`
`Beato held Maria tight,`
` even creating a small, warm universe within their joined arms...`
`.........It was probably the birth of the smallest universe in the world.`
`{n}...The smallest universe in the world, which a pair who needed each other could create...`
`No matter how small it was, that world was complete.`
`{n}............But I have to tear it apart.`
`{n}.....................`
`"......Sorry,`
` .........but I can't let things be that way.`
` I came to smash this Golden Land of Mariage Sorcière."`
`"............Why...`
`...would you break...`
`...my world.........?`
` Wh‐who has this world inconvenienced, outside Maria and myself......?!"`
`"This game that you started, and then walked away from without finishing,`
` is keeping Onii‐chan waiting forever!`
` If you don't return to your seat, the match will never end...!!"`
`".........Hahahahaha...ha...!`
` There is no longer even a single player in that game.`
` Battler vanished, and I came here and vanished as well.`
` That game is already over."`
`"It is not over!`
` You started that game, didn't you?!!`
` Take proper responsibility and see it through to the very end!"`
`"Either defeat Battler, and give birth to the world you truly wished for,`
` or be defeated and release everything swallowed up by your magic!!`
` Take responsibility until the very end!!"`
`"...............Don't, Ange.`
` Beato will spend her time in this world with me, just the two of us together for eternity.`
` ......And I don't need anything else either, as long as I have Beato.`
` ......All wishes come true here.`
` Everything is here."`
`............This Golden Land is made up of nothing more than the crystallization of Maria onee‐chan and {f:5:Beatrice}'s thoughts and feelings.`
`......To drag Beato out of this world,`
` ......I have to...`
`...destroy it.........`
`..................Destroy this Golden Land,`
` .........which must be the final world of peace for {f:5:Beatrice}......`
`"Onee‐chan. That's wrong.`
` This Golden Land is a liar.`
` It hasn't granted the one wish you truly wanted to come true."`
`".........That's not true!!`
` Everything is granted here!`
` Look, there's even a nice Mama here!!"`
`Gold butterflies gathered behind Maria,`
` forming into a kindly smiling Aunt Rosa.`
`.........And after smiling sweetly at me,`
` she softly became golden petals and crumbled.`
`"Anything can be created here.`
` Even you can be, and Battler, and George onii‐chan, and Jessica onee‐chan...!!`
` You can summon as many as you want, and everyone is nice...!!`
` You come too, Ange, let's play together......!!"`
`............Sorry, Onee‐chan............`
`"And what about Sakutarou......?"`
`".........—"`
`Upon hearing Sakutarou's name, Onee‐chan's face looked like she was choking.`
`"Stop it......`
` Do not speak that name......"`
`Beato's expression changed as well.`
`{n}And she put her arm around Maria, hugging her as if to protect her.`
`.........Sakutarou's name was still taboo for Onee‐chan.`
`"Why can't I say it?`
` It's the name of Maria onee‐chan's best friend."`
`"......Why won't you invite that close friend to this wonderful Golden Land?`
` Why, in this Golden Land where all wishes come true, is Sakutarou the only one you can't summon?"`
`"Th‐...that's because......`
` ......It's alright, {f:5:Maria}.`
` You don't have to remember Sakutarou—"`
`"............Sakutaro was killed by Mama!!!!"`
`Maria onee‐chan flew into a rage with a terrible expression on her face.`
`Surprised by that voice, butterflies flew up throughout the garden,`
` ......blowing around like a typhoon of flower petals.`
`"Yes, I know.`
` Aunt Rosa......took your precious stuffed animal Sakutarou, and tore him apart......!!"`
`"GYAAAAAAAaaaAAAAAAAAAAaAAAaaAAHHHH!!!"`
`Maria's scream became a storm and violently scattered the golden petals and leaves.`
`It was truly a storm of gold.`
`"Stop...!!`
` Stop stop stop...!!!`
` Why are you trying to reopen the wound in {f:5:Maria}'s heart...?!`
` Don't defile the sleep of a dear friend precious to both Maria and myself...!!"`
`"In that case, why won't you revive that precious friend for her with your magic?"`
`"I would have if I could...!!`
` But that stuffed animal was an article Rosa created herself!`
` The magical meaning of that unique object being torn apart is—"`
`"You aren't fooling anyone.`
` Why can't you revive Sakutarou?`
` There's only one answer.`
` It's because you aren't a real witch!"`
`".........I most certainly can revive him...!!`
` With my magic, I can revive him as often as I want, like this!!"`
`"I could even bury this garden in Sakutarous...!!"`
`"Yeah, I'll bet you could, with your magic!`
` But Onee‐chan definitely wouldn't be able to see the Sakutarous you create!"`
`"............You know why, right?`
` I'll say it again.`
` It's because you aren't a real witch...!!"`
`"Stop iiiiiiiiiit!!`
` Why do you keep saying such mean things, Ange...?!`
` Beato can use a lot of magic...!`
` She's a very wonderful witch...!!"`
`"Sakutaro was the one thing she couldn't revive, ......but she can do anything else...!!`
` So I can......put up with...`
`not having Sakutaro......"`
`"No, Onee‐chan, that's wrong.`
` .........There's nothing a witch can't do.`
` As soon as she couldn't do that,`
` {f:5:Beatrice} was not a real witch."`
`"Tha‐that's wrong......!!`
` It's because Sakutaro's stuffed animal vessel was something Mama made by hand herself, and—"`
`"And that's why she can't revive him?`
` Is {f:5:Beatrice}'s... Is your magic that inconvenient?"`
`"Gah, .........i‐......in that case, ......do you claim that you {i:can} revive Sakutarou?!`
` Can you do that with your magic?!"`
`"I can."`
`".........What........."`
`"Maria onee‐chan!!`
` I'll show you some real magic.`
` I'll revive Sakutarou for you!!"`
`"......Re‐`
`.........really......?`
` Even {f:5:Beatrice} couldn't do it, you know......?`
` ...Ca‐`
`.........can you really......?!"`
`"Yes, I can!`
` In exchange, promise me.`
` Once I've revived Sakutarou..."`
`"Yes...!"`
`"Leave this Golden Land."`
`"............!"`
`"I, I will not permit that...!!`
` This world is {f:5:Maria}'s and mine together!!`
` If {f:5:Maria} leaves,`
` ......it will break...!!"`
`The minimum amount of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s it takes to create a universe is two.`
`{n}If that breaks down, the world is destroyed.`
`To drag out the witch who shut herself away in the Golden Land, I have to destroy this world...!`
`"......Yes, and that is the proof that you are not a witch.`
` ......A real witch can create a universe alone."`
`"The Mariage Sorcière Alliance of Witches!`
` ......The very existence of this alliance proves that you are not a witch...!!"`
`"N‐no...!!`
` I will not give up {f:5:Maria}...!!`
` I hate you, leave right now...!!`
` Get out of heeeeeeeeeere!!"`
`"Dragging everyone into a game of your own accord, then getting bored and chasing them out when your mood changes!!`
` How selfish can you be?"`
`"Watch and learn, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` And you, Maria onee‐chan!!`
` This...is true magic.........!!!"`
`"Ca‐......can you really revive Sakutaro...?!"`
`"There's no way!!`
` This is a Golden Land for Maria and me alone...!`
` There is not a single piece of magic that an outsider like you could use here!`
` As you are now, you couldn't even create a single butterfly!!"`
`"Be quiet, Beato!!`
` Don't get in Ange's way...!!"`
`When Maria yelled,`
` ......the storm abruptly stopped, and the area returned to silence.`
`.........As the massive amount of golden petals that had been blown upwards quietly drifted down,`
` ......that scene looked so fantastical, as though a golden snow was falling......`
`Maria, thinking about this unlikely, if‐only miracle,`
` unconsciously joined her hands together as though praying.`
`......Beato's heart raced as she watched Maria do this.`
`.........If the extremely unlikely were to happen,`
` ...Maria would,`
` ......this world would......`
`But......it's inconceivable......!`
` An absolute impossibility...`
`That stuffed animal, the only one of its kind in the world, was torn apart and thrown away,`
` and not a thread remained.`
`Reviving it is an absolutely certain impossibility......!!`
`{p:1:This is my Golden Land}...!`
`{p:1:A world where magic that isn't mine certainly cannot exist}!!!`
`"G‐`
`......go right ahead,`
` ......I defy you to do it, Ushiromiya Angeeeee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eee!!!"`
`At Beato's scream, the world lost its sound.`
`I slowly...recited the incantation...for true magic......`
`"...............Come, try to remember.`
` Maria's close friend Sakutarou."`
`".........Try to remember what form you had."`
`".........Try to remember what a lovable stuffed animal you were."`
`"Huh, ..................ah, ...ah........."`
`"....................................!"`
`......Expressions of shock rose to both of their faces.`
`Then, ......pushing Beato's elbow aside, Maria dashed forward......`
`".........kutaro.........`
` .........Sakutarooo.........!!"`
`Then,`
` ............she threw her arms around him and me both.`
`"......It's alright.`
` Sakutarou...won't disappear.`
` ............`
` ‘Uryu,`
` Maria. I'm back.’"`
`"Sakutaro,`
` ......Sakutaro......`
` ......uuuuuuuuuuuuuuu,`
` waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuu!!`
` Sakutarooooooo......`
` I missed you......`
`...so much..............."`
`It was, unmistakably,`
` .........that lion,`
` ......that Sakutarou stuffed animal.`
`Maria had forgotten its softness, its texture, its stitches,`
` .........its everything.`
`But,`
` .........the instant she hugged the stuffed animal, everything came back to her vividly......`
`‘Uryu.`
` Maria,`
` ......I'm back.’`
`"Sakutaro, Sakutaro...!!`
` Is your body alright?`
` You aren't hurting anywhere?`
` Even though something so......horrible was done to you, you're alright everywhere......?!"`
`‘Uryu...!`
` Ange revived me with magic, so I'm perfectly fine...!’`
`"I'm so glad......`
` I'm so glad......`
` Welcome back, Sakutaro......`
`uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!"`
`‘I'll always be with you from now on, Maria.`
` Together forever.`
` ......So don't...`
`let go of me, okay.........?’`
`"Yeah, ......won't let go......`
` ......Never ever....................."`
`Then, still hugging Sakutarou,`
` she looked up at me with tear‐filled eyes...`
`"......Thank you, Ange...!`
` .........Your magic is amazing......`
` ......Why?`
` Why were you able to revive Sakutarou?!`
` Even Beato couldn't do it...!"`
`"..................Impossible...`
` ......Impossible......`
` ......How?`
` ......How can a human other than me use magic in my Golden Land?!?!`
` This is...`
`......completely impossible.........!"`
`"What are you so flustered about, {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` ..................This is...magic, right?"`
`"It cannot possibly be magic...!!`
` {p:1:This is my Golden Land}!!`
` {p:1:A world where magic that isn't mine certainly cannot exist}!!`
` And my`
` {p:1:magic was not able to revive Sakutarou}...!!"`
`"There's no way it could!!`
` {p:1:That stuffed animal was a special stuffed animal}!`
` {p:1:Rosa made it for her daughter's birthday, and in the entire world, only one of its kind}—`
`.........—`
`...............u...`
`...............hh......"`
`".....................See,`
` ...it's magic, right?"`
`"Ah...`
`......oh......`
`......ahh...`
`.........aaahhh,`
` .........aah...h...hh...hhhh......"`
`With this miracle that she could not possibly accept,`
` .........Beato...understood all of my magic......`
`And she looked at Maria and Sakutarou innocently frolicking around,`
` ......looked at me,`
` .........and then...`
`......fell to her knees,`
` ......with even her hands pressed to the ground,`
` ...............and cried.`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}...! This is really magic, right...?!`
` It's magic, right?!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}...!!!"`
`"...............Mm.........`
` ......It is magic......`
` ......That is...`
`......true...`
`......magic........."`
`"How can Ange use a magic that even Beato can't do?!`
` How?!`
` How?!`
` Ange's awesome, Ange's an awesome witch!`
` A real witch who's much, much more amazing than me......!!!"`
`"Yes, that's right, Onee‐chan.`
` ...............I am the Witch of Resurrection, {f:5:Ange}.`
` ......There is nothing that cannot be revived by me."`
`"Oh wow, oh wow!!`
` Even Beato said that the magic of resurrection was the hardest!!`
` {f:5:Ange}, you're awesome!!`
` A real real Great Witch......!!!"`
`At that moment, Maria's and Sakutarou's forms flashed gold,`
` ......and the two became golden flower petals, and crumbled away......`
`As the two became a golden wind and swirled together,`
` .........they left for some other place of peace.`
`Beato had, ......as promised, banished Maria from the Golden Land.`
`"......Goodbye, ...Maria onee‐chan.`
` And be happy forever.`
` ............It's alright, I'm sure "you" exist in Onee‐chan's world as well.`
` But that {i:doesn't refer to you}."`
`"...............I am happy for you,`
` ......Maria......`
` ......As your close friend,`
` .........I celebrate this reunion...from the bottom of my heart........."`
`On Beato's face......was a mixture of what was probably every expression a human could muster.`
`That expression—`
`it was joy,`
` it was anger,`
` it was sadness.`
`".........That is the basis of magic, isn't it.`
` ............Without love,`
` without sadness,`
` without anger,`
` ............magic cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}."`
`The ground shook.`
` ......An earthquake.`
`.........It gradually caused greater and greater fissures,`
` and began to tear {f:5:Beatrice}'s final paradise apart.`
`Golden butterflies fluttered about trying to escape, but there was nowhere to escape to.`
`{n}...Nor for {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`The Golden Land began to crumble away.`
`The earth gave way like a floor falling through,`
` .........and {f:5:Beatrice} was sucked into the depths of a jet‐black darkness.`
`Then, she was mercilessly slammed against a jet‐black floor.`
`......It was a small, nondescript, and very dimly lit smoking room.`
`There was no door to exit by, and while there were windows,`
` ......they let no light into this place—{f:5:Beatrice}'s smoking room.`
`Even as Beato moaned from the pain of being slammed against that cold hard floor,`
` she shakily rose to her feet......`
`A seat was there.`
`......And the game table, ......still just as it had been when she had left it.`
`The game board, too, was preserved in the same state in which Beato had abandoned it.`
`"That is your seat.`
` Sit."`
`"...............So, this is the only seat...`
`......for me to sit in........."`
`Beato put a hand against her own seat, ......and laughed sadly.`
`"Win, or lose.`
` That is all you are given.`
` A tie during the process of reaching that point will probably be permitted."`
`".........But the one thing I will {i:not} allow is for you to suspend the game and throw it away!`
` Either win and survive, or lose and disappear!`
` Until one of those two things happens, you will not be permitted to rise from that chair!!"`
`"Isn't that your only duty as the host of a witch's game, as the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}...?!!"`
`Laughing weakly, Beato...`
`...sat down.`
`......Then she rested her elbows on the table, covered her face with both hands,`
` .........and managed to put together a smile with just her mouth.`
`".........Not permitted to escape an unwinnable game.`
` .........Very well, then.`
` ......Why don't I repeat this......until I lose......"`
`"Spare me the pity show!`
` Win.`
` Use the very best moves you have...!!`
` You started this game!`
` You have a duty to make the best moves possible!!`
` Enough with all this indecisive fooling around!"`
`Just then, there was a heavy sound.`
`{n}......Beato felt a cold and pitiful sensation on her leg.`
`"......Gotcha...!`
` I finally got you, eh, Beato~?"`
`"Oh, if it isn't the great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}...`
` .........To think that you were still here."`
`Beato's foot was locked in an ice‐cold steel shackle,`
` ......fastening her to the chair she sat in.`
`......She would no longer be able to escape from this seat.`
`"Oh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!`
` You won't be able to escape anymore, got it?`
` I'm more persistent than I look. Surprising, huh?"`
`"............I'm more surprised that you weren't already aware of it."`
`"You are not permitted to leave early or suspend the game.`
` You'll fight for all eternity, in order to win, of course.`
` .........You don't want to lose, right?`
` You wanna little peek at the kind of wonderful world you'll be thrown into if you loooose?"`
`"Don't worry...`
` You can win... {i:Until you do}, I, the great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, will stick right by you and look after you for all eternity...!!"`
`".................................`
` ......Hmph, ......hahahahaha.`
` .........But even if I wish to fight, I have no opponent across from me, correct......?"`
`".........It's alright, I've found Battler."`
`When {f:5:Bernkastel} appeared and clapped her hands,`
` Battler appeared from the sky and plopped into the opposite chair.`
`Battler's eyes were slightly opened, but there was no sparkle in them, almost like a doll.`
`Without the one pillar that established his soul,`
` ............he had fallen into the very depths of darkness, and had been drifting about all this time.`
`......By rights, he should have dispersed and vanished like mist.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} had managed to scrape him together.`
`{n}It was surprising that she had managed to bring him back into a human form.`
`However, even though his body had returned, his soul had not.`
`{n}......It was blown away when his existence was denied by {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}It wouldn't come back easily.`
`"...............Battler won't run from this fight either.`
` Not until he beats you.`
` ......We won't permit such boorishness as to throw everything away and run just because the chances of winning have grown slim."`
`"Not even he himself wants that.`
` ............Right, Ushiromiya Battler...?"`
`Battler didn't answer.`
` ......His heart was still...dead.`
`His eyes wavered slightly at the question, but he couldn't answer.`
`"Battler...!`
` Get ahold of yourself!`
` You are here.`
` And the enemy is before your eyes...!`
` Fight!`
` Fight to win!!"`
`Battler lazily and incoherently parroted her words.`
`.........He was back.`
`But the trauma inflicted on his soul was no small thing.`
`That was only natural.`
`{n}{f:5:Beatrice} had woven her red, and he had been denied.`
`He had learned that the mother he had respected was not his birth mother,`
` .........and he didn't know who he was.`
`......I am not...`
`...Ushiromiya Battler............`
`"Don't talk stupid!`
` You are Ushiromiya Battler and no one else!"`
`"No matter who else admits that or denies that, make sure you believe it yourself...!!`
` You are the only one who can create your own world, you know.`
` Don't lose the world where you are Ushiromiya Battler!"`
`"...............Then,`
` ............who...`
`...am I.........?`
` I'm not Mom's kid......`
` Where was I born from......?"`
`Battler asked while gazing lazily up at the ceiling, with eyes that still hadn't regained their sparkle.`
`Of course, she answered right away.`
`"Yes, that's true.`
` Beato declared it with the red truth.`
` ......So I'll declare it too.`
` {p:1:Ushiromiya Battler is not Ushiromiya Asumu's son}."`
`".........Hmph, ......in that case, he is not qualified to be the opponent in my game, is he..."`
`"Repetition request for {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` "Ushiromiya Battler is not Ushiromiya Kinzo's grandchild"."`
`".............................."`
`As Beato wrinkled her forehead,`
` ......a pained smile rose to her face.`
`"Declining to repeat, I see.`
` Beato declared two red truths:`
` "{p:1:You are not Asumu's son}",`
` and`
` "{p:1:No one except Kinzo's grandchild Battler is qualified to be her opponent}"."`
`"The following theory will see you accepted as qualified without any contradictions.`
` This is my blue truth—listen to this...!"`
`{p:2:The one who is qualified to be Beato's opponent is "Kinzo's grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler",}`
` {p:2:and whether that person is "Asumu's son" or not is not an issue}.`
`{p:2:In other words, you can be Kinzo's grandchild even if you are not Asumu's son}.`
`{p:2:As long as you are Rudolf's son}!`
`"Hmph, what a stupid word game."`
`"...............Blue truth, valid.`
` Beato, your counterargument with the red truth?`
` If you cannot counter it with the red truth, there is no problem with Battler's qualifications as an opponent."`
`"................................."`
`.........Battler was still out of it.`
`{n}He still couldn't really understand what she was saying for him.`
`......But even so, his spirit was starting to come back bit by bit...`
`"..................Then,`
` ............who...`
`......am I......?"`
`"Get ahold of yourself!`
` You are Ushiromiya Battler!`
` Yeah, maybe Asumu okaa‐san didn't give birth to you.`
` But so what?!`
` That doesn't change in the slightest the fact that she was a mother to you, right?!"`
`".........For example, what is Ushiromiya Ange to you?`
` You might not share the same blood, but she's still your little sister, right?!`
` It's not about blood, it's about bonds, isn't it?!"`
`"............Well...yeah......`
` ......Even though we don't share the same blood, ......Ange is...`
`......my little sister."`
`"Say it in red!`
` Say that Ange is your little sister!!"`
`".........`
`{p:1:Ange is......my little sister}.`
` .........ah, ............it worked."`
`She hugged Battler, who was still out of it and slumped in his chair, strongly from behind.`
` So strongly that it hurt.`
`"I don't know why Asumu okaa‐san wasn't your birth mother.`
` But still, until today you believed that she was your mother, and you still do, right?!`
` In this world, there are plenty of people without even a mother,`
` ......without even a family!!"`
`"Did Asumu okaa‐san ever let you feel lonely?`
` Never, right?!`
` Don't throw your peaceful family away so easily!!`
` Your family bonds have gotten way too thin after leaving your family for six years!!"`
`"You have to feel those family bonds much, much more strongly!`
` Remember!!`
` For Asumu okaa‐san's sake, don't lose your affection because of some stupid ravings from a witch!"`
`"...........................`
` .........You're right......`
` ......Mom was......always on my side......"`
`"...............Where is this place......?`
` ......It's dark......`
` ......I wanna go home......`
` Where's...`
`all of my...`
`...family.........?"`
`The light still hadn't returned to Battler's eyes.`
`{n}But......tears formed there.`
`"Your little sister is waiting at home for you to come back.`
` She needs you at least to come back, ......or she'll be all alone forever...!`
` For your little sister's sake if nothing else, please win this witch's game...!!"`
`"............Ange......`
` My...`
`...little sister.........`
` ......But the thing is...`
`......I don't know anymore...`
` .........Why do I...`
`have to keep repeating this incomprehensible, cruel game with Beato forever......?`
` ......I've...`
`...had enough........."`
`"In that case, hurry up and finish off this game and go back home!!`
` Ushiromiya Battler, how long are you going to play around in a place like this?!`
` Your little sister is waiting for you to come home!!!"`
`.........That's right.`
`Battler was caught up in this strange game before he even knew it.`
`And, unable to understand what he was fighting for,`
` he was taken along at the witch's pace, toyed with and made to fight, for a very long time.`
`That should have been the simplest and first question.`
`......Not understanding that is why he loses his purpose for fighting...!!`
`It's why my voice doesn't reach his ears...!`
`What he needs is not some vague purpose, like winning against the witch, or because she's unforgivable.`
`......He needs to become aware of a purpose for which he {i:must} win.`
`".........That's right......`
` ......I want to go home......`
` ......To Mom and Dad,`
` ......and Ange......`
` .........I've had enough,`
` ......enough of this place......`
` ......I've had enough of witches, I've had enough of games and murders......`
`......enough,`
` enough......"`
`"Battler's soul...is starting to come back."`
`"...............But it can't quite reach."`
`"You've had enough, right?!`
` Then fight so you can return to your family!!`
` Destroy {f:5:Beatrice} and come home!!"`
`"No, ......no more witches...!`
` Enough of Beato, ...enough of everything...and you too, you're probably just another one of the witch's allies...`
` I could be betrayed again at any time...!!"`
`"{p:1:I can't trust anything, I can't trust any words that aren't red}...!!`
` Leave me alone, leave me alo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooone!!"`
`Battler's soul howled.`
` She hugged his head from behind, so tightly that it hurt.`
`"{p:1:Hurry up and come home, Onii‐chan}!!`
` {p:1:Don't leave me all alone}!!!"`
`"...............Huh......?`
` .........Who...`
`...............are you......?"`
`"{p:1:It's me, it's Ange}...!!`
` {p:1:No one's coming back home, Onii‐chan, not you, not Mom, not Dad}!!`
` {p:1:I'm so lonely}!!`
` {p:1:Please, hurry up and come home}!"`
`"......A‐.........Ange......`
` .........So you were.........Ange............"`
`"{p:1:That's right, I'm Ange}!!`
` {p:1:The Ushiromiya Ange of a world where no one comes home}...!!`
` .........{p:1:My entire family...never came home from Rokkenjima that day}...!!"`
`"{p:1:The witch before your eyes stole away my whole family, even you}...!`
` .........{p:1:Only you can finish her, Onii‐chan}!!`
` {p:1:Finish her}...!!"`
`"{p:1:And take your family back}!!`
` {p:1:And then.........come home to me}......!!!"`
`"...............Beato stole...`
`...my family........."`
`"......Hmph, ............as she says.`
` I will not run away or hide from it.`
` ......I stole Ushiromiya Ange's family away from her."`
`"Battler is my toy!`
` His father and mother too, all of them are my toys.`
` ......I won't give them back to you.`
` ......You may continue to wander alone forever, awaiting the return of your family that is never to be......!"`
`From Ange's arms that held him, ............the very painful, sad, and lonely days...`
`...that his little sister, left all alone, had gone through...flowed into Battler......`
`......Because he had been playing around in a place like this,`
` ............his little sister had been left all alone, .........and had been forced to endure...`
`.........such painful days...............!!`
`"...Ange, .........Ange.........!!`
` Shit, ......I've, .........what have I been doing.........?!!`
` Thanks a bunch, Ange...`
` Onii‐chan......has been forgetting something important this whole time......!"`
`Battler tried to turn around,`
` but Ange was clutching his head with an incredible force, so he couldn't.`
`......Sweat?`
`Hot drops splashed the back of Battler's neck.`
`......What they were...he discovered by holding Ange's arm as she clung to him.`
`.........Because it stained Battler's hand...his fingers...red.`
`".........Blood...`
` ......A‐Ange?!`
` A‐are you alright?!`
` H‐hey......?!"`
`It dripped and splashed.`
`He didn't know what was going on.`
`Battler couldn't tell for sure because he couldn't turn around,`
` but the hot drops staining his entire back were surely......blood.`
`"............In order to save you, Onii‐chan,`
` in order to come here,`
` there was a single rule that I wasn't allowed to...`
`...break...`
` .........This...`
`.........was it.`
` .........Letting you...`
`......find out...`
`...that I was...`
`...Ange........."`
`......It was so hard.........`
`My onii‐chan was right before my eyes, ......and I couldn't even tell him.........`
`If I'd just followed the rule, ......I would have been able to stay by your side forever.`
`.........You and me together...`
`...playing the game against the witch...`
`...for eternity......`
`"But...`
`......that's no good."`
`"............Onii‐`
`......ah...`
`.........chan,`
` ......you have to go back."`
`".........Back home,`
` ......your sister is waiting for you......"`
`".........That person isn't me,`
` ............but this way, your sister...`
`will find her salvation........."`
`"Ange?!`
` Ange!!`
` There's so much blood...!!`
` So much, so much!!"`
`He wanted to turn around, but he couldn't because of how tightly Ange was gripping his head.`
`However, judging by the blood that was pouring out and Ange's pained breathing,`
` he realized that something seriously wrong was happening to her right now.`
`"............Don't...worry.........`
` ......I am just......a piece......`
` .........You know, in chess, ......they have this thing called a <sacrifice>......"`
`"Sacri—......what?!`
` Who cares about that!!`
` Let's get you some first‐aid quickly!!`
` Let go for a second, Ange...!!"`
`".........A <sacrifice>...is a thrown piece.`
` For the sake of the strategic vision, you intentionally let a piece go, in full awareness of the loss..."`
`The ultimate goal in chess is victory against the opponent.`
`{n}......So sacrificing a few individual pieces is no problem if that can bring you to victory in the end.`
`Ange had made a levelheaded decision.`
`.........She had been told over and over again that she was a piece, not a player.`
`......In order to act like a piece and save Battler, right now, she herself needed to become a sacrificial piece.`
`............Battler had to be made aware.`
`His purpose in playing this witch's game must not be something abstract like finishing off the witch.`
`He needs to win the game, he needs to release himself, and he needs to bring his family back home.`
`Why?`
` .........Because he has family—a little sister—waiting for him to come home.`
`A being created to bring Ushiromiya Ange's voice to him...`
`{i:That} is who {f:5:Ange Beatrice} is—who I am...!!`
`I will use the piece I am as a sacrifice...`
`to give Onii‐chan the will to fight, to give him purpose!`
`Onii‐chan, my purpose is not to play with you in a witch's game for all eternity!`
`I came to bring you Ushiromiya Ange's mourning and sadness!`
` That is my unshakable purpose!`
`"......Ange!!`
` Ange!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaarrrghhh!!!"`
`The white, skinny arm holding Battler......was pale and transparent, almost like wax.`
`...But it was stained, so cruelly, with fresh blood......`
`"...I'm.........`
`...going to disappear now, but......`
`......you fight with all you've got,`
` .........and make sure you...`
`...come back to me, okay........."`
`"............I'll be waiting,`
` ............always...............`
` ......I planned on helping you out a whole lot more than this,`
` ......but I couldn't do anything.`
` ......Sorry....................."`
`"D‐don't worry about that......!!`
` You......taught me, didn't you......?!`
` You taught me why I have to win...!`
` And that...I absolutely have to win, and come back to you......!!"`
`"What have I.........been doing, lazing about playing in a place like this......?!!`
` Yeah, I'm not playing around here anymore...!!`
` I'm gonna come back, you better believe I'll come back!!`
` I'm definitely gonna come back, bringing a souvenir, I promise......!!!"`
`".........I don't need one,`
` .........so just promise me one thing......"`
`"What is it? I'll promise anything...!!"`
`"......In a second, I'm going to take my hand away......`
` It must have hurt, right......?`
` I held you so tightly...`
` .........Sorry........."`
`".........I'm alright,`
` ......you don't have to turn around, so...`
`.........before I go...`
`...show me you at your...`
`...coolest.........`
` ......Rise from your seat,`
` ......point at the witch before your eyes,`
` ......and declare that the game will recommence........."`
`Ange's hand......slid...`
`......and disappeared behind me.`
`The stark marks of her fingers were left behind in the blood that had been oozing from her fingernails...`
`But I turned around right away.`
`{n}To take care of Ange's wounds...!`
`"Angeeeeeeeee...`
`eeee...ee.........`
`........................`
` ......Ange...?"`
`"Aa~ah, and you even promised that you wouldn't turn around..."`
`"......A‐......Ange.........`
`ah, aahhh, ...wh‐where'd she......"`
`Behind my chair,`
` .........as though......about ten watermelons packed with blood...`
`...had all been smashed,`
` ......there was a sticky, pulpy...`
`...mountain...`
`And around that mountain of blood and minced meat,`
` ......the clothes and shoes Ange had been wearing...`
`...lay crumpled as though they had been thrown off...`
`......As though a human's insides alone had been pulverized and discarded.`
`......As though Ange, who had been standing there until just a second ago, had been crushed.........`
`"Ange......?`
` Wh‐......where is Ange......?`
` Where did Ange disappear to......?`
` H‐hey!`
` Where did Ange disappear to?!"`
`The two young‐looking witches said nothing,`
` .........and just silently looked at the mountain of blood and meat and clothes.`
`But, ......I didn't want to accept it.`
`{n}......I did not want to accept it!!!`
`"..................I was right in front of you.`
` .........Watching the whole time.`
` Watching what happened.........to Ange behind you."`
`"......D‐......do you know......?`
` .........Where did...Ange go.........?"`
`".........While she still lived,`
` pinch by pinch, massive red‐hot pincers...`
`...tore chunks of flesh the size of a thumb off of her,`
` ......and threw them away."`
`".........I was watching.`
` I watched as countless cruel tools, red‐hot from the witch's furnace, approached Ange from behind,`
` and one bit at a time, ......pecked at her flesh, twisted it off, ripped it off in chunks, ......and tore her to pieces."`
`"............Ange should be proud.`
` In order to exchange her last words with her brother,`
` ......she withstood the gasps of pain until the very end...`
` ......She should be proud of that."`
`......Like hell that happened......`
`But......rolling there,`
` ......on top of that mountain of flesh and clothes,`
` ............was, without a doubt, what she had been wearing on her head: those pink‐bead...hair ornaments.`
`To be honest, I was thinking they were a bit too childish and didn't really suit her...`
`......So I remembered them well.`
`...............Why has Ange been wearing these cheap hair ornaments all this time......?`
`No, no,`
` ......this can't be Ange,`
` ......it couldn't be,`
` ......uug...uuuuhhhuuuuuuu...!`
`".....................That was honest, Beato."`
`"Battler didn't see it,`
` so you could've just said that she turned into butterflies and flew away, or something."`
`"......Y‐`
`...you guys also...`
`.........s‐......saw...`
`.........that happen......?"`
`"Y‐`
`......you watched Ange...`
`...get torn into...`
`...little bits...?"`
`"You were watching,`
` .........and yet...`
`...you kept your faces...`
`...that calm.........?!"`
`Without answering, {f:5:Bernkastel}, {f:5:Lambdadelta},`
` and {f:5:Beatrice} looked at me,`
` ......some in pity, ...others in derision.........`
`She was calling herself Gretel,`
` so after what happened with {f:5:Virgilia} in the last game, ......I was thinking up until now that she might be Beato's underling,`
` and I was making sure not to trust her even though she was on my side...`
`And then,`
` .........just as I learn that it was actually Ange,`
` ......I'm not permitted to see her face...`
`.........and when I turn around,`
` ......I find...`
`......something...`
`......like this...`
` ............uuuuuuoohhhhh.........!`
`"What does it matter?`
` .........About your little sister."`
`"......What......did you say............?"`
`"You will never return from this place in any case.`
` .........Whatever happens to your little sister in a world where you don't come home has nothing to do with you."`
`"As long as you play here, the Anges of countless worlds will live in isolation,`
` and the same pain of her final moments just now will be forced upon them, diluted over a period of more than a decade."`
`".........However, that is of no importance, correct?`
` It cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen} by you from here.`
` You cannot observe it.`
` An unobservable truth cannot be proven except by the red truth."`
`"Therefore, your anxiety over Ange's future unhappiness might well be an ungrounded fear.`
` ............She might, surprisingly enough, have an easy life ahead of her, never needing to work, thanks to Rudolf's inheritance, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`......That was...`
`...a lie.`
`From Ange's arm, every part of the sad world that follows had poured into me in an instant.`
`It's all because...`
`......I keep on...`
`......lazing about forever...`
`......and playing in a place like this.........!!`
`......I...`
`never thought about anyone but myself......`
`I have to defeat her!`
` I have to take back my family,`
` ......and come back to Ange who's waiting for me, ......as soon as humanly possible.........!`
`Because even as I hang around with the witch like this,`
` Ange's heart continues to be torn to bits by sadness...!!`
`"............Ange, ......is {i:this}...`
`......what you wanted to see......?"`
`......Towards the cruel witch who had indifferently spoken of Ange's brutal last moments, slowly,`
` ......and yet...`
`...with all my might,`
` ......I pointed......`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice}......"`
`"Mm."`
`"............Resume this game.`
` .........I won't run away anymore, ......and I won't let you get away, either."`
`"As I like it.`
` I can no longer escape or hide.`
` .........Let us settle this between us for certain.`
` .........One will win.`
` One will lose, and be destroyed.`
` No other resolution exists."`
`".........I will win.`
` No matter how long it takes, I will definitely defeat you...!!`
` In this match, there will no longer be any compromise, interruptions or losing by default!!`
` I won't run away!`
` You won't get away!!"`
`"Come take me down, with everything you've got...!!`
` There's no need for any stupid tricks or deceptions, no need for interacting with each other weirdly or acting all friendly!!`
` You and I are enemies...!!!`
` I have to settle this as soon as possible, .........and bring my family back to Ange!!!"`
`......Unwavering purpose.`
` ...Absolute, certain willpower.`
`A {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}'s certain willpower becomes certain magical power.`
`......That acts as a miracle, and makes it a promise.`
`Yes, this is a promised {i:certain miracle}.`
`..................Is there not even a one in ten‐billion chance...{n}`
`no.........is it {i:certain that there is not even a fragment of a miracle}...{n}`
`that could make my victory happen?`
`Before I knew it, a cold, stiff chain had bound my other leg without a sound,`
` fastening me to the chair...`
`............All that is left to me is either to be killed by Battler and be defeated,`
` or resist that, and repeatedly tie for all eternity.`
`......No, I guess that's "repeatedly tie until I prepare my heart for death".`
`Either way.`
`.........I must now fight only to lose.`
`I have already been bound in eternal chains.`
`And Battler won't let me escape either.`
`......Should I pathetically beg for his forgiveness...?`
`Should I ask for compassion by appealing to his pitying heart...?`
`Should I disregard appearances and prostrate myself?`
`Because of the chains, even that will not be granted me.`
`......Checkmate.`
`The perfect endgame.`
`.................................However.`
`I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`The demon lord of gold who reigns over the Golden Land.`
`It may be a losing battle, but still there exists an attitude befitting my stature.`
`And I have the right to beautify my death in a manner fitting for me.`
`".........And I likewise.`
` I will make you accept the existence of my magic, and open the door to the Golden Land on this island.`
` You shall become the guest of honor at the very first tea party."`
`"Everyone besides you has gathered already, you see?`
` Because the arrival of the guest of honor has been delayed, the tea party cannot begin.`
` Your father, mother, cousins, and everyone else are getting tired of waiting for your arrival."`
`"Yeah, suits me, suits me absolutely perfect!!`
` Magic and witches, what a load of bullshit...!!`
` I'm done playing games with you!!`
` Here we go, {f:5:Beatrice}...!!!"`
`"I suggest you hold nothing back, for there will be no compromise, interruptions or losing by default.`
` One will win, and one will be destroyed."`
`"If you have no desire to lose, then you must defeat me, kill me.`
` However, I will not go down without a fight.`
` I can resist repeatedly, until you prepare a fitting end for me."`
`"Are you capable of doing that?`
` ......Yes, I'm sure you can.`
` I know you can.`
` Now...come kill me.`
` ..................`
` .....................Am I making you uncomfortable?`
` Then let's go with something more familiar.`
` ....................."`
`"Hyahhaha!!`
` Like hell I'll be killed,`
` even if I can't win, I can still frustrate the hell out of you by not giving you the victory, rii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}ight?!"`
`"Hoh, that's a good look on your face!`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*,`
` uhhyahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha,`
` aaa{0}kkya{0}kkya{0}kkya{0}kkya{0}kkya!!"`
`"Try and kill me,`
` just try and kill me, Ushiromiya Battleee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eer!! Rrrrr{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}h{0}h{0}h{0}h{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhh!!!"`
`.........I don't have a clue what to make of all this.`
`Please, someone explain what happened yesterday in a way that I can understand.`
`I continued helping myself to the food in the mansion's kitchen.`
`That massive commercial refrigerator had everything.`
`{n}I could eat and drink as much as I liked.`
`......I'd have more than enough to eat even if the typhoon didn't clear up for a week.`
`With a bottle in one hand, half of which I'd already drunk, I helped myself to some sliced ham.`
`I wonder just how expensive this stuff is.`
`Man, you ingredients are out of luck.`
` If only you'd had Gohda‐san cook you, you could've been reborn as much more incredible food.`
`I looked at the clock.`
` Very soon, it would be midnight.`
`{n}October 5th, the second day, would end.`
`.........The insanity of yesterday's October 4th didn't seem real.`
`{n}...That was how......little had happened after my so‐called test.`
`Nothing was happening.`
`No phone calls, no letters.`
`{n}No one coming to see me, no one coming to attack me.`
`Not a goddamn thing.`
`Gimme back all the time and energy I wasted being on edge.`
` .........An entire day, a full twenty‐four hours.`
`......And aaaabsolutely nothing happened.`
`{n}And I'm sure that nothing will continue to happen as well.`
`.........A full twenty‐four hours ago...`
`{n}...I was called to the front of the mansion by {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`There, I was given some kind of weird test to do with determining the successor to the head or something.`
`I gave a serious answer in my own way, but unfortunately, we just didn't seem to be {i:getting} each other.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} got bent out of shape for no reason and stopped talking to me.`
`I yelled at her to say something, but she wouldn't say a word.`
`Then I asked where Maria was, and she just told me to go to the chapel, and went away.`
`What an astounding anticlimax.`
` ......Stupid as it was, it was still a test, so at least tell me whether I've passed or failed, for hell's sake.`
`What, is she trying to say "Good work, your results will be mailed to you later" or something?`
`{n}......Annoying bitch.`
`In any case, I then headed to the chapel.`
`......Both George‐aniki and Jessica had been killed after failing their tests.`
`{n}I couldn't let Maria be killed too.`
`......Besides, I thought this could be a chance to catch whoever it was while they were in the process of trying to kill Maria.`
`When I was young, Jessica often told me that I'd get in trouble if I went near the chapel,`
` so I'd never been there, but I at least knew where it was.`
`I couldn't sense anyone there,`
` .........but there was a bundle of keys lying in front of the door.`
`I thought this might be a message to open the door to the chapel, but after trying all of the keys, I found that none of them fit.`
`I also called Maria's name, but there was no answer whatsoever.`
`{n}I searched around the chapel, but there was a limit to what I could do in the pitch black with just a flashlight.`
`I realized that this key bundle might be a set of master keys, which could possibly open the door to the mansion.`
`Finding no sign of Maria, I returned to the mansion.`
`The mansion was wrapped in silence.`
` And in a horrible stench.`
`Still, it's pretty amazing how good humans are at adapting.`
`Technically, that smell was still pervading the entire mansion.`
`But I'd grown completely used to it and stopped minding it by this point.`
`It didn't feel like anything more than any old house where someone had burnt some meat.`
`The stench knocked me back on first entering, but I ignored it and decided to head to the dining hall...`
`......where I found all those corpses that were in such a sorry state that Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san had hesitated to speak of them in any detail.`
`They were the remains of the very first victims: Aunt Natsuhi and the rest.`
`Each of them had half of their head dramatically splattered out,`
` and it was such a gruesome sight that even without knowing a thing about examining corpses, I could pronounce them one hundred percent dead...`
`......And on top of that, the remaining half of their faces were left like normal, so it was even easy to identify them.`
`...They'd really pulled out all the stops for these corpses.`
`And finally, the bodies here weren't just the six of the first twilight—they had grown in number, and now included one more.`
`The seventh corpse............was Maria.`
`She was lying next to Aunt Rosa, as though sleeping alongside her.`
`...............I cried.`
`At the death of an innocent young girl.`
` And at the cruel way my dad and the others had died.`
`I ran about the mansion swinging my hat‐stand spear, yelling "Come out here, you bastard".`
`......But there was absolutely no sign of anyone else.`
`......Thinking that they might be hiding somewhere and scheming to attack me from behind, I went around searching for possible hiding places,`
` sometimes being cautious,`
` sometimes intentionally letting my guard down, trying all kinds of things, but in the end, not so much as a kitten appeared...`
`Then, morning came.`
`......My tension and fatigue, mixed together with my drowsiness, made for the worst kind of dawn.`
`Humans are pretty incredible.`
`......Even though I didn't know where the hell the murderer was hiding, I was prioritizing drowsiness and fatigue over worrying for my own life.`
`......By this time, I was starting to feel pretty ridiculous.`
`I had walked around the mansion for a full six hours until dawn broke, yelling at them to show themselves.`
`I had done a painstaking search, tired myself out, and even let my guard down.`
`{n}{i:Still} no one was coming to attack me.`
`And so at that point I just said screw it, do whatever you want.........`
`The boat wouldn't come until the typhoon passed.`
` They were saying on TV that it wouldn't pass until tomorrow, so I had a whole day to waste.`
`The idea of just lazing about didn't seem very appealing,`
` ......so, even though I knew it would probably make the police mad, I decided to play detective a bit.`
`First: the dining hall, where the very first murders occurred.`
`The six who were killed in the beginning really were pitiful to look at.`
`......The weapon was probably a gun.`
` Maybe their heads were split by something powerful, like a magnum bullet or a shotgun.`
`That seemed like valid reasoning.`
`In comparison, Maria, who was the seventh body, had died in a far better and cleaner way.`
`At a glance, there were no external wounds, and it wasn't clear how she had been killed.`
`But there were signs that bubbles had been foaming from her mouth,`
` and it looked like a typical death by poisoning that you might see on a TV drama.`
`Wasn't Maria called out to the chapel and given her test there...?`
`......Then why is she here in the corpse‐filled dining hall, lying next to her mother, dead......?`
`Assuming that the cause of death was poison, ......who gave it to her?`
`Her clothes aren't disturbed at all.`
` It's hard to imagine that she was forcibly pushed down and given an injection of poison.`
`.........It's probably better to assume that she was given a poison capsule or something and made to swallow it.`
`That said, compared to the violently mutilated corpses scattered about this room, Maria's corpse was far too clean.`
`With a gun, all you need to do is pull the trigger.`
` But poison, whether injected or made to be swallowed, would take a lot more effort.`
`Bearing in mind the culprit's brutal nature, too, I felt that Maria's death alone had clearly been given special treatment.`
`Why was Maria alone given a sleep‐like death?`
`.........She {i:was} killed, so in that sense, I still felt very sorry for her—there can be no doubt about that—`
`but for some reason, the manner of Maria's murder in particular seemed very courteous to me......`
`Maria had her hands joined on her chest, in the way that the dead often do.`
`......Did Maria do that herself before dying......?`
`{n}......Isn't this usually something done by someone else after the person dies......?`
`Maria was resting in peace, as though sleeping together with her mother, whose head was half crushed.`
`......For some reason, the contrast really bugged me.`
`There are probably a lot of mysteries surrounding Maria's death, starting with the cause...`
`And more than anything else.`
`The biggest mystery of this dining hall......was the "pitfalls".`
`{n}......The "pitfalls" that both Uncle Krauss's group and Gohda‐san's had mentioned.`
`After the six had been killed, five more had fallen through "pitfalls" and been captured.`
`.........What are pitfalls?`
`{n}Those things that suddenly open and you fall through them, right......?`
`The floor was firmly laid with a majestic, if a bit worn‐out, carpet.`
`......It was clearly a single piece.`
`If pitfalls are meant to open up in it, there would have to be a seam in that one place.`
`......And anyway, if there was some trick like a pitfall, wouldn't it creak when you walked on it??`
`No matter how much I walked over or ran my hands over the carpet, I just couldn't imagine that a pitfall was hidden here.`
`In the first place, it would be one thing if a single person had fallen, but it was a full five people.`
`......From what I could piece together from all of their stories, each one of them had fallen from a different location,`
` so at the very least, there had to be five separate places concealing pitfalls.`
`...............So what does this mean?`
`Was this room actually made with pitfalls across the entire floor,`
` so that with a single button press, you could open up a pitfall in the location of your choice......some kind of contraption like that??`
`That kind of ridiculous mechanism would be surprising even in a ninja mansion.`
`......But even so, if Dad and the rest heard about this,`
` maybe they'd say "I wouldn't put it past Grandfather—you bet he'd do this, he'd make this".`
`......In any event, I didn't learn anything more than that from the dining hall.`
`Do the pitfalls not exist?`
` Or do they exist, but I just can't find them, amateur that I am?`
`I can't say for sure.`
`Since they claimed that the pitfalls were there,`
` ......I can't ignore the pitfalls even if I can't find them......`
`The next ones to be killed had been Jessica and George‐aniki.`
`{n}I'd already discovered George‐aniki, when I was called out for my test.`
`He was called out to the arbor in the rose garden, ......and shot in the forehead, probably with a gun.`
`As for Jessica, she was called to her own room on the second floor of the mansion.`
`I found the door to her room locked.`
`{n}But that wasn't a problem at all since I had the master keys.`
`And the inside of the room.........was horrible.`
`...But the corpse was nothing I hadn't already familiarized myself with in the dining hall, ......so I'd built up a bit of an immunity.`
`The phone receiver was dangling off the hook.`
`{n}......Was she killed while on the phone with me?`
`Jessica was leaning against the wall right next to it,`
` ......with half of her head splattered out.`
`As far as I could tell by looking at the scene, ......it looked as though she had been killed while on the phone.`
`In that case, had the culprit been there before her eyes?`
`.........I hadn't gotten that impression from Jessica's voice over the phone.`
`I'm pretty sure Jessica said......“They got me”.`
`It's probably best to assume that she had already received a fatal wound at the time of the phone call.`
`That's right, and she also said this.`
`"By the time you get here, I'll be a corpse with half my head spilled out."`
`Yes, she definitely said that.`
`.........From what I could tell by looking at Jessica's corpse, there were no wounds on her other than the damage to her head.`
`Then...she was injured seriously enough that she steeled herself for death, and then died halfway through the phone call?`
`But it feels like, with the way she was talking on the phone, she was out of danger for the time being.`
`You shouldn't be able to have a casual conversation over the phone if the killer is right in front of you.`
`So...did the culprit come partway through the phone call and kill her......?`
`.........No, that can't be right.`
`{n}After all, this room was locked.`
`......No, like hell that counts for anything.`
`......If the culprit had stolen a master key from one of the victims, the fact that it was locked is meaningless.`
`But there are no external wounds other than her head.`
`.........In which case, should I assume the fatal wound she was prepared to die from and the actual wound that destroyed her head were two different events,`
` both of them made to the same part of the body......?`
`In other words, Jessica was struck severely to the head, and received an incredibly bad wound.`
`Then she called me, ......and either lost consciousness or died while on the phone.`
`Then the culprit came and destroyed her head for real...or something.`
`After being called to this room, Jessica was attacked by the culprit and seriously injured.`
`And the culprit thought they'd killed her, and went away for the time being.`
`......But then Jessica miraculously started breathing again, and called me with a literal dying message.`
`Then the culprit realized that they had failed in killing her, and rushed back to deliver the final blow to Jessica, who had lost consciousness from massive blood loss......`
`...............That seems to make sense, more or less.`
`Except for how Jessica was able to accurately predict the form of that final blow.`
`And there was one more thing that bugged me about the phone call from Jessica.`
`Jessica said this...`
`"George nii‐san didn't make it either.`
` Instant death, that was."`
`......She said it almost as though she had witnessed George‐aniki being killed.`
`But while you certainly could see the rose garden from the window in Jessica's room,`
` the arbor that George‐aniki had been called out to was very far away—you could only just make out the roof.`
`Add on the fact that it was the night of a typhoon, and it's very hard to imagine that she was able to witness everything that happened by the arbor from this window.`
`......And most important of all.`
`Jessica left before George‐aniki.`
`{n}So she shouldn't have known that George‐aniki's test had taken place by the arbor.`
`How did Jessica know......that George‐aniki had been killed......?`
`.........Then, in the course of my search of the entire mansion, I found Kyrie‐san's corpse as well.`
`She was in an old guest room tucked away on the first floor.`
` This was where all of us relatives used to stay before the guesthouse was built.`
`......The situation with Kyrie‐san was just like Jessica's.`
`She was probably killed during her phone call with me.`
` The receiver was hanging untidily, ......and Kyrie‐san was collapsed beside it.`
`But the way she had been killed was very different from Jessica.`
`Her head wasn't smashed.`
` ......Instead, something like a stake with an occult‐like design was buried into her forehead.`
`......It was too gruesome for me, ......so I pulled it out.`
`It was only after pulling it that I realized that this might get me into trouble with the police later.`
`So, even though it was probably a little late now, I laid it by Kyrie‐san's side.`
`Its tip was sharp, and stained with enough blood that it must have penetrated fully to the brain.`
`I didn't know what kind of metal it was made of, but it was about as heavy as a paperweight.`
`{n}Certainly, if you were stabbed all‐out with something like this, it might cause a terrible wound.`
`.........I...probably understood what this stake meant.`
`......Yeah, I know this.`
`{n}It's the method of killing from the fourth twilight onwards in the witch's epitaph.`
`{n}......That "gouge with a stake and kill" thing, probably.`
`However, the human skull is very hard.`
` .........Even with all one's strength, could you really pierce through it this sharply......?`
`No.`
` ......The way I reason it, this stake wasn't the cause of death; it was just used to damage the corpse after death.`
`She was probably killed by being shot with a gun or something, like George‐aniki,`
` .........and the stake was stuck into the hole left by the gun.`
`......Thinking about it that way, everything works out.`
`But......was Kyrie‐san really killed with a gun?`
`She had said this on the phone as well—Kyrie‐san was under attack even though she was holed up inside a locked room.`
`And this room actually {i:was} locked.`
`......And...`
`...she had said something about a golden thread‐like thing flying in through the keyhole and attacking her.`
`And in fact, there {i:were} four places around Kyrie‐san's corpse with holes that could have been caused by some kind of attack.`
`.........But still...`
` ...A golden thread...`
`......attacked her through the keyhole...?`
`I looked at the door from Kyrie‐san's perspective.`
`If it had been one of those old locks like you see in old mystery movies,`
` where you can peek through to the other side, then you could understand that something might potentially have come through it.`
`But even though the doors in this mansion were old‐fashioned, the locks were the familiar, average cylinder style that you could find in any normal house.`
`......In other words, there {i:was} no hole going all the way through, by construction.`
`So no matter how thin an object it might have been,`
` it's impossible to imagine that it could have penetrated through the keyhole from the outside and attacked her.`
`.........Cylinder lock.`
` .........Keyhole.........?`
`But Kyrie‐san had definitely said that something like a golden thread had flown in through the keyhole,`
` ......and spun around and around, aiming for her, attacking her......`
`"A golden thread attacking through the keyhole".`
` .........I couldn't understand what it meant at all.`
`Wait, actually.`
` ......Kyrie‐san predicted that I probably wouldn't be able to understand all this.`
`And not just Kyrie‐san.`
` Jessica said it over the phone too.`
`......No, since the very beginning, from the time we talked with Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san, and got the phone call from Uncle Krauss's group,`
` everyone has been saying the same, consistent thing.`
`.........Grandfather is summoning witches and demons, and killing people with magic.`
`We witnessed it happening with our very own eyes.`
`{n}No tricks, no illusions.`
`{n}No choice but to believe it.`
`......They all said it, with one voice.`
`When that mysterious woman calling herself {f:5:Beatrice} appeared,`
` even I pretty much believed that she was a real witch and might start summoning goat monsters right and left.`
`......However, after being left alone for a whole day, once my feeling of tension faded completely,`
` I had a level enough head to think that this was way too stupid to possibly be true.`
`In that extraordinary situation where their lives were exposed to danger,`
` did they just lose their heads a little, and mistakenly think that a witch was attacking them with magic?`
`............But multiple people testified to the same effect, and on top of that, none of their opinions contradicted one another.`
`......If it had been a single person's statement, I'd be able to suspect that they just didn't see what they thought they saw,`
` ......but doing that now is pretty...difficult......`
`Then, right next to the back door, I found Uncle Krauss with his head half destroyed.`
`......Even though he'd escaped the dungeon of Kuwadorian,`
` and somehow made it out of the secret underground passage and all the way here, ......he was killed.`
`Buried into the gruesome cross‐section of his half‐destroyed head...`
`...was a stake with an occult design, just like the one that was driven into Kyrie‐san's forehead.`
`And in this situation, it was very hard to imagine that this stake was the murder weapon.`
`......He was killed with a powerful gun like the six in the dining hall,`
` and after death, he was stuck with a stake, like Kyrie‐san.`
`I wonder if the golden threads that Kyrie‐san spoke of attacked Uncle Krauss too.`
`Does there exist some kind of tool, like an endoscope, which is very thin but can be moved about at will.........?`
`And that can also attack people......?`
`{n}No way. I've never even heard of anything like that.`
`But even so, ......if I voiced that suspicion to one of my relatives,`
` perhaps they {i:would} say "I wouldn't put it past Grandfather to make one"...`
`Since I can't refute the existence of a golden thread X that can be moved at will and attack people,`
` my only options are either to accept this completely incomprehensible weapon, or else,`
` ......to accept that these murders were committed with magic.`
`To find the next corpse, I had to go out through the back door and search around outside a bit.`
`Behind the mansion, in the wild‐grown bushes that were almost swallowed up by the forest, there was something like an old well,`
` ......and right next to it were the corpses of Doctor Nanjo and Shannon‐chan.`
`Both corpses had their heads smashed.`
`......And there was a stake lying right next to each of their destroyed heads, though they weren't stuck in.`
`......All of the corpses were atrocious, but having to look directly at Shannon‐chan's lovely face, half of which was blown off, was very painful......`
`Then, there was the well.`
`Inside which, I was told, was a secret underground passage to the mysterious mansion, Kuwadorian.`
`...By this time, I was beginning to think that {f:5:Beatrice} and her accomplices...`
`might have used this underground passage to leave for Kuwadorian.`
`There were supposedly ten or more of these guys, and I hadn't seen hide nor hair of any of them.`
`......It made a hell of a lot of sense to think they'd already escaped somewhere else.`
`They had this typhoon to contend with.`
` They couldn't go out to sea.`
`Same for the forest.`
` There was no way they could traverse such a deep, uncultivated forest on foot.`
`In that case, there was only one place for them to go.`
`The mysterious hidden mansion, Kuwadorian.`
`{n}......The secret underground passage at the bottom of the well...!`
`......By this time, I had entirely lost my fear of being killed if I happened to come across the enemy.`
`Screwing with me like this...!`
`{n}This time I'll march into your mansion...!`
`".........Ah...... ...Wh‐what the hell...?!`
` D‐......damn it...!!"`
`The old well had a firm cover on it.`
`The cover was an iron grill.`
`The gaps between the bars were perhaps twenty centimeters square.`
` You could peer inside, but it really wasn't something a human could pass through.`
`If I hadn't known better, I wouldn't have thought it to be anything more than a simple cover to protect against falling in.`
`......But from what Kyrie‐san had told me, I knew that it had been made to prevent intruders from entering the secret underground passage at the bottom...!`
`But the cover was fixed in place extremely firmly, and no matter how much I pushed or pulled, I couldn't even get close to removing it.`
`I couldn't find any obvious lock.`
` Maybe it was sealed by some mechanism.`
`But no matter how much I investigated it, I couldn't find anything to release it.`
`.........The underground passage in this well is the biggest piece of information I have, that Kyrie‐san gambled her last moments trying to tell me about...!`
`"Don't think you can stop me with something like this cover...!`
` I'll smash it to bits...!`
` I'll search for a tool...!"`
`I had an idea of where to get one.`
` ......Because I'd seen the various tools in the gardening shed when we locked Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san in there.`
`But the shutter to the gardening shed was locked.`
`{n}On top of that, the key was with Gohda‐san, who was inside, dead.`
`......In other words, this gardening storehouse was a locked room.`
`{n}There was no way to open it from the outside.`
`In that case, I would have to break the shutter.`
`{n}I wonder if there's a tool for that somewhere...`
`......It kind of felt like I was going in circles.`
`Then, while searching for that, I learned that the source of the stench that had been permeating the mansion this whole time was the underground boiler room.`
`The boiler room was dimly lit, humid, had a terrible stench, and on top of all that, was incredibly creepy.`
`But there were several large tools there, and I was able to find a fire hatchet and a massive bolt cutter.`
`And............Grandfather's corpse too.`
`No, strictly speaking, I should probably say that I found the burnt corpse of a person who was probably Grandfather.`
`Someone's corpse had been stuffed into the blazing fires of the boiler......`
`However, by coincidence, I was able to notice the number of toes on the corpse.`
`......Both feet had six toes.`
`......Yeah, actually, I might have heard that from Dad at some point, long ago.`
`Something about Grandfather having polydactyly, with extra toes.`
`It was apparently an old Ushiromiya tradition for people with extra fingers or toes to be treated as a good omen, saying they had good fortune or something.`
`......And that's why Grandfather was selected to be the next head...or something along those lines.........`
`But I wonder if I can be certain this is Grandfather's body just from the number of toes.`
`After all, Grandfather was supposed to be the leader of the group of culprits.`
`I don't have a clue why he'd be dead and stuffed in a boiler in a place like this.`
`A mysterious corpse, burning and belching out a terrible stench amid the flames.`
`......If it really was Grandfather,`
` ............did that mean that the leader of the group of culprits wasn't Grandfather, but that {f:5:Beatrice} after all......?`
`Grandfather was used because he was convenient, and was then thrown away at the end?`
`.........Unfortunately, it didn't look like I'd be given a chance to hear Grandfather's explanation...`
`Now that I had obtained a tool, I thought about immediately taking on the cover to the well,`
` but I decided to break the shutter to the gardening shed first.`
`......I had plenty of time to kill anyway.`
` I thought I should check on the condition of Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san's corpses.`
`I hit the shutter with the hatchet, breaking into it,`
` stuck the bolt cutter into the crack,`
` and scissored it around, opening up a hole.`
`Then, I came face to face with Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san's corpses once more......`
`As a result, I learned some new facts.`
`First, they did not die by being hanged.`
`{n}Their feet were solidly on the floor.`
`......And both of their foreheads showed signs that they had been shot with a gun.`
`When I thought about what a normal noose was like, the ropes seemed considerably on the long side.`
`On top of that, the length was different on each to match the height of each person.`
`In other words, the lengths had been adjusted so that both Gohda‐san, who was tall, and Kumasawa‐san, who was short,`
` had their feet solidly but barely on the ground.`
`Also, while the ropes carried both of their weights as their heads lolled, both of them had some slack below their knees.`
`This meant that if they stood upright with these nooses around their necks, there would be some extra length.`
`In other words, these ropes were a bit unsuitable to hang someone with.`
`The direct cause of death was probably the shot to the head.`
`It was gruesome.`
` Their insides were still dripping out from those deep holes, staining their faces a deep red.`
`Then they were hung up by their necks and left on display—that probably makes the most sense.`
`......If they were shot with a gun, they would probably have been lying down on the floor.`
`......If that had been the case, you wouldn't have been able to tell they were dead by peeking through the window.`
`The mountain of stuff would have gotten in the way, so if they had been lying down, they would have been hidden.`
`To make the deaths of these two known to the rest of us who couldn't get inside,`
` they had to hang them like this so we could tell from the outside.`
`.........Was this......to get back at us for thinking that the two of them would surely be safe if we left the key with them......?`
`I wonder where the shutter key we gave Gohda‐san, which should have ensured their safety, is now...`
`That key.........was in his trouser pocket.`
`{n}The gardening shed key had been kindly left there, and even the tag was still attached.`
`In other words, the gardening storehouse was a locked room after all.`
`And that gave rise to another question.`
`{n}......Because this hanging was inexplicable.`
`If they didn't commit suicide, then the nooses were set up by the culprit.`
`......It might have been possible to shoot them through the window, but I really can't imagine that someone could have tied two ropes to the beam from the outside.`
`And on top of that, they would have had to lift up the heavy corpses—there's just no way.`
` In other words, to do all of this, they would have had to go inside.`
`But the key was in Gohda‐san's pocket, and the shutter was still locked.`
`In other words, the gardening storehouse was a locked room.`
`Gohda‐san had said that there was only one key for this shutter.`
`......But is it possible that there was a copy,`
` ......and that the culprit was in possession of it......?`
`If we're allowed to theorize that there were actually multiple gardening storehouse keys, and that Gohda‐san just didn't know about them,`
` then this isn't even close to a locked room.`
`.........But why is it that, despite the fact that almost all of the other corpses were shot to death and left almost completely alone,`
` these two corpses alone were intentionally hoisted up?`
`I couldn't help but feel something a bit odd about that......`
`Assuming that the mystery corpse in the boiler was Grandfather,`
` ......the deaths of 16 people had now been confirmed.`
`There were 18 people on this island.`
` There's me, and 16 corpses.`
`Kanon‐kun's corpse was the only one I hadn't been able to confirm yet.`
`According to Kyrie‐san, he was killed while climbing out of the well, and fell down into it.`
`So with the well closed up like this, it was impossible to check.`
`I tried shining a flashlight through the bars, down into the darkness in the depths of the well.`
`But it seemed that the jet‐black darkness had no intention of showing me its innermost depths with this inadequate light...`
`It looked like I'd have to break the bars after all.`
`Using the hatchets and things I'd dragged out of the boiler room and the gardening shed, I tried breaking the cover of the well.`
`But the metal bars were extraordinarily sturdy, and breaking them wasn't easy.`
`......I hit them with the hatchet over and over, until my hands started feeling weird, and eventually gave up on breaking them......`
`......It was impossible.`
` If they were at least wood, I might have been able to break them.`
`{n}But this metal...`
`Yeah, there's no way you can slice through metal bars like butter with a human's strength.`
`......I can't even begin to understand......that story about how Kanon‐kun cut through the metal bars.`
`She told me that a light like a red laser beam grew out of his arm,`
` and he used it to slice through the metal bars like a knife through butter.`
`Cutting through metal bars like butter...?`
`......And what's with the red laser beam.`
`{n}Does that mean he snuck in a burner or something,`
` and used that to burn through the bars......?`
`Still, just what kind of laser.........could cut through metal bars like {i:butter}?`
`...It sounds exactly like the kinds of laser beams that showed up in those robot anime I loved as a kid.`
`Does stuff like that actually exist......?`
`{n}And how did Kanon‐kun get that laser beam......?`
`As much as I want to ask him, he's already been killed.`
`{n}Plus, even his corpse is now at the bottom of the well, beyond this cover.`
`If Kanon‐kun managed to slice through those metal bars, I'm sure he could handle this metal cover in a single swing.`
`......It kind of feels like the locked room just now, with Gohda‐san locked inside the gardening storehouse holding the key.`
`Only one person can open the door, but they're locked inside......`
`......If only I had that power of Kanon‐kun's, I could do something about this cover myself......`
` .................................`
`Just who is Kanon‐kun?`
` He couldn't really be......an inhuman being capable of using a strange power, right?`
`Even Kyrie‐san told me to believe in witches, and I've also met an insane woman calling herself one.`
`...Could Kanon‐kun possibly be...`
`...a human on the witch side...?`
`{n}......Or else...`
`......the culprit?`
`............What the heck.`
`{n}......Am I gonna start treating him like the culprit...just because I can't find his corpse?`
`Hoh, ......treating him like the culprit simply because there is no corpse...?`
`And who was the one babbling about the suspicious being innocent......?`
`.........Very well, I couldn't bear having you push all the crimes on Kanon and making that into a human culprit theory.`
` I will guarantee it with the red...`
`{p:1:Kanon is dead}.`
`{p:1:Among the five in Kyrie's group, he was the first to die}.`
`{p:1:In short, he was the ninth victim}.`
`"......Since there's no corpse, ......I can't say for sure...`
`that Kanon‐kun is dead."`
`So, my whispering in red does not reach the piece you.......`
`{n}.........But it did reach {i:you}, right.........?`
`At a glance, this appeared to be a mass murder committed using something strange that could only be thought of as magic.`
`......Golden threads that attacked through keyholes.`
` No, we even had testimony that something gold had flown around the dining hall during the first six murders.`
`The two might have been the same weapon.`
`Then there was the locked‐room murder of the garden shed, and the laser beam that could cut metal bars.`
`......And that wasn't all.`
`There was much, much more...like the group of goat monsters,`
` the talk of a witch who could create pitfalls just by snapping her fingers, the rabbit‐like demons who had fired golden threads...`
`I think there were more, .........and each and every one of them was ridiculous.`
`I couldn't possibly accept it, and was forced to suspect that there was some kind of trick or mistake.`
`......But why in the world had everyone spoken with one voice, saying the same thing without contradictions in their testimony...?`
`It's not only the magic.`
`Maria's mysterious death.`
`Jessica somehow knowing that George‐aniki had been killed.`
`The mysterious burnt corpse which I couldn't confirm actually belonged to my piece‐of‐shit grandfather.`
`......And more, and more.`
`All stuff I just don't get......!`
`I tilted the bottle and glugged it down noisily.`
`{n}......I didn't have a clue what was going on.`
`After dinner last night, we kids were shooed out of the mansion and told to go back to the guesthouse,`
` .........and then there was a massacre in the dining hall.`
`Kyrie‐san and the rest were dropped through pitfalls and captured.`
`Then Jessica and George‐aniki were called out to a test or whatever and killed.`
`Kyrie‐san's group managed to escape the dungeon somehow, but all of them were killed in the end.`
`And at the very, very end, even Maria was killed, leaving me all alone.`
`.........In short, I had done nothing except be locked up in the guesthouse.`
`During that time, a huge incident had occurred, and ended, before I knew it.`
`What could I call it except incomprehensible?`
`{n}I don't have a clue anymore!`
`"Now I'm nothing but a pig.`
` You plan on leaving only me alive...?`
` Hurry up and show yourself and come kill me already.`
` I can't be bothered to look for you anymore."`
`"You show me your true form yourself......!`
` I won't run or hide, so come at me with arrows or bullets or whatever...!"`
`I haven't had any sleep since yesterday, and I'm tired as all get‐out.`
`{n}You wanna kill me, be my guest.`
`I decided to return to the guesthouse and boldly rest on the bed.`
`......As I exited the kitchen and passed through the lobby,`
` .........that portrait of the witch came into view.`
`The big clock did too.`
`{n}......At that very moment, it was exactly midnight.`
`And the sound of the bell, proclaiming that it was midnight, rang out......`
`As I listened, ......I looked up at {f:5:Beatrice}'s portrait.`
`Exactly twenty‐four hours ago, I met you.`
`What were you trying to say to me...?`
`{n}And where did you go?`
`Just who in the world are you.........?`
`{n}Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`I haven't solved a single one of the riddles surrounding you......!`
`Show yourself...`
`{n}.........And fight with me...!!`
`Then......the witch showed herself.`
` Like a guest of honor finally appearing, she showed herself on the landing at the top of the big staircase......`
`"So you finally show yourself......`
` ......I've been kept bored for an entire day."`
`"...............Yes.`
` I gave you a whole day.`
` Were you able to sufficiently exercise the rights of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} side?"`
`"Yeah.`
` I was bored, so.`
` I had a good go at it."`
`"............Ange...was a good piece."`
`"Don't you......speak Ange's name."`
`".........She appeared through a miracle, and sacrificed herself to give you the tenacity for certain victory."`
`"Don't you...speak Ange's name."`
`"............That brutal death was something that you needed.`
` If you hadn't seen that death, you would not have grown serious.`
` Without the wake‐up call of Ange's ill‐fated future, the tenacity for victory would not have arisen within you."`
`"I told you not to speak Ange's name...!!"`
`"............In short, she was a necessary sacrifice.`
` Otherwise, an anger great enough to kill me would not have been born within you.`
` The rivalry between us cannot be destroyed."`
`"Curse that Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}—this was no piece, it would be more fitting to call it a trump card.`
` ......No matter how helpful a piece is, it will never stray from the board.`
` But a trump card, no matter how powerful its effect, is always discarded after it is used."`
`"Ange was truly a good trump card for you."`
`"Don't you...speak Ange's naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaame!!!"`
`At Battler's outburst of rage, Beato finally stopped talking.`
`"......You know, I have no more time to spend playing around in a place like this.`
` ......Even our draws are keeping Ange waiting."`
`"............I am going to break through you,`
` ......take my family,`
` ......and go back home!!`
` I don't have a single second to waste playing witches with you!!"`
`"In that case, I assume you know.`
` What must be done."`
`"Yeah!`
` I'll beat you down!!`
` I'll blast away all witches, magic, illusions, and delusions!!"`
`"Alright, let's do this!!!`
` I won't ever let you trick me again!!`
` The game's restarting, you ready?!`
` I'll tear apart the witch's veil that conceals the outright lie you are!!!"`
`"You talk too much.`
` All you have to do is simply say "I will kill you"."`
`"Yeah.`
` If those are the words you want, ......I'll say them for you.`
` This is the first and last wish of yours that I'll lend an ear to."`
`"............I thank you."`
`"I will.................."`
`"..........................."`
`“I will kill you......!!!”`
`"Then by all means!!`
` Let us begin, Battler...!!`
` Come, it is time for the witch hunt...!!`
` Try and chase me, try and corner me, try and kill me! I'm expecting a lot from you!!`
` Try and show me what your little sister gave you in her last moments...!!"`
`"Bring it oooooooooooooooooooooonnn!!!"`
`......Battler's cry burned the world with a white light.`
`And when one's eyes were opened to that brilliant light, ......the two of them could be seen in a rose garden......`
`".........Who takes the first move?"`
`"Me."`
`"How brave."`
`The rose garden, where beautiful rose petals danced.`
`{n}The color of those rose petals...was red.`
`Was that a proof, or simply a claim, that the two of them facing each other in this beautiful rose garden...`
`was the red and only truth?`
`.........That must be why...the roses are red.`
`But in the language of flowers, roses are passion.`
`{n}......Not truth.`
`The flower for truth is a forget‐me‐not.`
`{n}That flower......is blue.`
`"I'll pierce through everything with my blue truth.`
` .........From the very beginning of it all.`
` I'll start from the very first game!"`
`"Very well.`
` Show me your skill.`
` ...Come."`
`"Here I go.........`
` I've already proclaimed it, but I'll say it again.`
` ......This isn't just for the murder of Doctor Nanjo in the last game.`
` This will tear apart every scene from every game since the beginning...!!"`
`"{p:2:Ushiromiya Kinzo is already dead}!`
` {p:2:Therefore, the true number of people on the island is 17}!`
` {p:2:By adding an unknown person X to that, it becomes 18 people}.`
` {p:2:By supposing that this person X exists, the crime is possible even if all 17 people have alibis}."`
`"{p:2:By this, even though the number of people reaches 18, it is still possible for culprit X to exist and carry out the crime even if all 18 people seem to have alibis}!!"`
`You can break through all of the murders in Episode 1 by supposing an unknown person X.`
`Furthermore, it is even possible to explain the mystery of Kinzo's evaporation from the locked room sealed by the receipt,`
` by making the bold assumption that Kinzo wasn't there from the beginning.`
`Unless Beato countered this with the red truth,`
` the witch illusions of Episode 1 would be completely smashed.`
`.........The blue truth was valid.`
`The wedge of blue truth that Battler had released stabbed right through the top of Beato's left foot.`
`......Was the red blood that poured out from there her defense in the red truth...?`
`Beato shut one of her eyes tight, enduring the unbearable pain from the wedge of blue truth that denied her.`
`"Hmm, not bad.`
` ......But I am still far from denied, far from killed.`
` ......That is not close to enough.`
` .........The following games contain mysteries that cannot be explained with that alone, do they not?"`
`"......Which mysteries?"`
`"In the final stages of the second game,`
` George, Gohda, and Shannon barricaded themselves in Natsuhi's room, and were killed.`
` The key by which they unlocked Natsuhi's room was locked up inside the room, and all of the remaining keys that could unlock the door were in the hands of Rosa.`
` Even if culprit X existed, it should be impossible to construct a locked room."`
`The blue wedge piercing Beato shook.`
`{n}She was resisting, fighting to push it out.`
`"No, that doesn't shake my blue truth.`
` If culprit X was in possession of a master key, that's not even close to a locked room."`
`"No, it was impossible for the culprit to obtain one.`
` {p:1:All of the master keys were under Rosa's control}!"`
`"But that's meaningless if Aunt Rosa was an accomplice to the culprit!`
` {p:2:Aunt Rosa handed a key over to culprit X by some method, assisting in the locked‐room murder}!`
` {p:2:And after that, she retrieved the key by a similar method}!"`
`"You'll have to do better than that, Beato!!`
` I already put forward that theory at the time!"`
`"......*cackle*... So you did......"`
`"...Gwaaargh...!!!`
` .........agh, ......nghh..."`
`The wedge that had been gradually losing its brilliance, and seemed as though it was about to come out,`
` regained its strong blue again thanks to Battler's additional blue truth, and dug into Beato again, eating into her foot.`
`Beato let out a moan of anguish at the pain of it.`
`".........guh, ......ohh......`
` .........Not yet...`
` This is still nothing......`
` Not yet,`
` .........not yeeeeeeeet!!"`
`"Continuing on to the third game.`
` The six linked locked rooms, the murders of Auntie Rosa and Maria, the deaths of Dad and the others in the hall, and the murders of Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi...`
`all of them`
` {p:2:can be explained if we suppose that Aunt Eva was the culprit}."`
`"This argument was already won back then.`
` And even that final riddle you proposed through {f:5:Eva},`
` {p:2:the murder of Doctor Nanjo, can be explained with an 18th unknown person X}.`
` Now I've broken through the entire third game!!! Can you counter that?!"`
`"Mgh, gh...!!`
` ......O‐of course......!`
` This much is......nothing to worry about......!"`
`"In that case, how do you explain George's disappearance from the guesthouse?`
` I shall add to the red truth.`
` {p:1:George did not go down the stairs of the guesthouse}.`
` He flew out through the window!"`
`In the final stages of the third game, George suddenly vanished from the second floor of the guesthouse.`
`Eva, who had been on the first floor, claimed that no one had come downstairs,`
` but if, as the blue truth claimed, she had carried Krauss and Natsuhi's corpses outside, there was the possibility that George could have secretly gone downstairs during that gap in time and escaped.`
`But by adding on to the red truth, Beato had disproven that.`
`To go outside without going down the staircase to the first floor, he would have had to leave by the window.`
` But all of the windows were locked from the inside...!`
`"So what.`
` It's just like you said.`
` He flew out the window, right?`
` Even if he did jump down, you couldn't tell by the grass, and it was raining so hard.`
` Any light traces would have disappeared."`
`"I will repeat the red truth.`
` {p:1:All windows and doors leading to the outside were locked from the inside}.`
` {p:1:Furthermore, it is impossible to lock any of those from the outside}!`
` George had no technique by which to lock them...!"`
`"I will repeat the blue truth.`
` I said it myself at the time.`
` {p:2:In that case, everything works out as long as someone locked the window after George‐aniki escaped through it}!`
` Nothing difficult about it!!"`
`"Gwaaaaaaaahhaaaaah...!!`
` Gguuuuhhh...... Is this not......enough to resist...... Is it not enough......?"`
`Beato couldn't remove the blue wedge that was buried into her foot.`
`{n}The fake witch was burned more and more by the strong blue......`
`"In all games up to the third, there is still nothing that shakes the blue truth.`
` ......In that case, the only game that can prove you're a witch......is this game, the fourth game."`
`"......As I have not countered with the red truth, that is indeed the case.`
` I will have to prove witches with only this game.`
` .........Very well.`
` Hold nothing back."`
`"There's nothing strange about the six murders in the dining hall.`
` {p:2:The 18th person X went wild with a gun and killed everyone}.`
` {p:2:Regarding the pitfalls, there is every chance that pitfalls truly were hidden there,`
` and it's also possible to explain them with Kyrie‐san's theory hypothesizing the existence of a poison‐dart‐shooting device X which can knock a person out instantly}."`
`"{p:2:The murders of George‐aniki, Jessica, and those who escaped from the dungeon can also be explained with guns, just like the dining hall}.`
` There's nothing strange about it!"`
`"But I know you, you've got a counterattack, right?`
` Bring it on!!"`
`"Your greatest sword, this 18th person X, is based on the theory that Kinzo was already dead.`
` I knew that you would make that claim.`
` That is why I took Kinzo out of his study."`
`"Everyone at the family conference welcomed that Kinzo, did they not?`
` {p:1:All of those present at the family conference acknowledged the existence of Kinzo}!"`
`"Uh‐huh.`
` But Grandfather's supposedly been seriously ill, confined to his bed, hovering on the verge of death for ages, right?`
` Even if he was so worn out that he looked like a different person, maybe no one would have paid that any notice, what about that?"`
`"I'll come back at you with this.`
` {p:2:That Grandfather was a different person, a body double}.`
` {p:2:A different person who the relatives mistook for Grandfather}!"`
`"Then I'll respond with this.`
` {p:1:No person would mistake Ushiromiya Kinzo by sight}.`
` {p:1:No matter what the disguise, they would not mistake Ushiromiya Kinzo by sight}!"`
`"Then how about this.`
` {p:2:By declaring with the red truth in the second game that the number of master keys was five, when in the first game the number was more than five,`
` you changed the premises of the later games}."`
`"{p:2:In the same way, there is a possibility that Kinzo's life or death status was changed for the fourth game}."`
`"{p:2:Therefore, Kinzo's existence in the fourth game does not serve as proof that he existed in the previous games}...!`
` {p:2:Therefore, even if we suppose that the six murders in the dining hall were carried out by Grandfather himself, it doesn't create any contradictions}!"`
`"Then I'll counter with this.`
` {p:1:Kinzo's life or death status is the same at the start of each of the four games}.`
` {p:1:The setup was not different for the fourth game alone}...!"`
`"Repetition requested.`
` "Kinzo was alive at the start time of every game"!"`
`"Decline repetition.`
` I won't answer, Battler.`
` I will not respond with the red truth you desire...!"`
`"......Damn it......old man, you're standing in my way...!!`
` Are you putting yourself on the line to protect {f:5:Beatrice}, your beloved witch?!"`
`My goddamn grandad wavered into vision.`
`......Heh, is he trying to be some kind of knight, blocking the way between me and Beato...?!`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*, Battler.`
` Are you capable of surpassing me...?"`
`"I won't let you reach, I will not let you reach, ......not to heights of the Golden Witch, ohhhhhhh no!`
` Fuhha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!`
` Your shallow logic cannot even surpass me alone!`
` Die!!!"`
`Kinzo's jet‐black cape spread as though it would swallow the world,`
` becoming the snout of a vast black dragon, which came at me, trying to swallow me in one mouthful.`
`......As I faced the roaring of the black dragon, I calmed my breathing and closed my eyes lightly......`
`"I'll swallow you up in a single gulp!!`
` Begone, you witless, inadequate foo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ool!!!"`
`".........Shut your trap, you damn undying ghost."`
`"Hoh, so you call me a ghost.`
` You intend to see it through to the end, then, this theory that I am already dead!!`
` That will be your undoing!!`
` On the first twilight of the fourth game, the darkness shall swallow you up!!"`
`The black dragon's vast mouth, its snout, its fangs...threatened to swallow Battler whole...!!!`
`In that instant, Battler suddenly opened his eyes!`
`"Thanks, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Your third game was the foothold I needed for my counterattack."`
`"What...?"`
`"See ya, my old old bastard.`
` This is goodbye.`
` .........I lay out the following theory to demonstrate that I can apply the dead‐Kinzo hypothesis even to the fourth game!"`
`"So be it! Come at me with all you have, my descendant!!"`
`"Here I go, you sack of old bones!!`
` {p:2:My theory is that Kinzo's name is passed on as the title of the Ushiromiya family head}!"`
`"{p:2:Ushiromiya Kinzo was already dead}.`
` {p:2:And he passed {i:his name} on to someone else}!`
` {p:2:Everyone acknowledged it}!!`
` {p:2:And, therefore, ‘all of those present at the family conference acknowledged the existence of Kinzo’}!!"`
`"{p:2:There wasn't even any need for this person to disguise themselves as Grandfather}.`
` {p:2:Because everyone recognized a new ‘Kinzo’}!`
` {p:2:Therefore, they didn't actually ‘mistake Kinzo by sight’}!!`
` {p:2:As long as the preceding theory is not disproven, nothing can change the fact that you're dead}!!!"`
`"This is the final blow.`
` Old geezer, this repetition request is for you.`
` "Not one person present had multiple, differing names"!!"`
`"I... I...can...not............!!`
` Gah, gwoooooooooooooooooooragghgghghh!!"`
`"Rest in peace, you old grandbastard.`
` You should thank me—you were finally able to die.`
` This is your requiem, take it and drop dead!!"`
`"{p:2:Ushiromiya Kinzo was already dead}!`
` {p:2:Yeah, poor old you—whenever we find your corpse, it's always completely burnt}.`
` {p:2:That was a gimmick to prevent discovery of the fact that time had passed since your death}!!"`
`"{p:2:And you passed your name onto someone else}!!`
` {p:2:With this theory, even though {i:you} are dead, {i:"Kinzo"} can still appear at the family conference}!!!"`
`"{p:2:How's that? This is checkmaaaaaaaaaaaate}!!"`
`Several dozen blue stakes bored into Kinzo's ghost.`
` Their terrible destructive power would never permit the ghost to recover......!!`
`"......{f:5:Be......atr...ice}........."`
`".........Kinzo...`
` Thank you for everything.`
` ......Rest...in peace......`
` I will not forget......the days I spent with you........."`
`Dispersing along with the shadow of the black dragon as golden flower petals scattered,`
` ......Ushiromiya Kinzo became a gold‐colored cyclone and disappeared......`
`Even after death, you fought for the sake of the woman you loved.`
`{n}......Your love and madness were, without a doubt, the real thing......!`
`"...............ngh, ............Battler............"`
`"No hard feelings.`
` ......Let the dead sleep.`
` Don't wake them.`
` ......You're next.`
` And you'll be the last."`
`Beato still couldn't pull out the blue wedge that pierced her foot...`
`{n}Beato realized that she was on the verge of death...`
`"I've gone along with you a whole bunch.`
` I think I've more than fulfilled any responsibility to play with you.`
` ......But it's about time to finish things up.`
` I've got a lonely little sister waiting at home."`
`"......Me and my family are going home...!!"`
`"......Then kill me.`
` ......Then try and kill me!`
` ......I will not run or hide—at this point, even dodging is beyond my capabilities!!`
` Come ooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oon, Ushiromiya Battleee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eer!!!"`
`"You got it!!`
` With the 18th person X from the dead‐Kinzo theory, everything remaining is pierced through!"`
`"{p:2:George‐aniki and Jessica's deaths in the fourth game can also be explained by culprit X}!!`
` {p:2:And the five who escaped from the dungeon and were killed, and the two in the gardening shed, and Maria in the end}!`
` {p:2:All of those can be explained with an 18th person X}!!`
` {p:2:There's nothing strange at all}!!"`
`"This concludes the explanation of the culprit, with humans, for all games!!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}, ......this here is...checkmaaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aate!!"`
`"Uuhk......uaaaaAAAAaaaaAaAAaaaaaahhh......aah—hhk—"`
`Several blue stakes were driven into {f:5:Beatrice}, who could not dodge, skewering her......`
`Beato grabbed the stakes, trying to pull them out somehow...`
`.........Aaaaaaahhhh,`
` ......he got meee......`
` .........It huurts.........`
`...Yeah, this'll.........kill me.........`
` ......If I don't pull these out,`
` .........I'll die......`
` I don't want pain......`
` ......I don't want to...`
`......suff.....er.........`
`With both hands, ......Beato firmly grasped one of the blue stakes.`
`......Naturally, the power of the blue truth to deny witches burned her hands.`
`...Unable even to hide her tears at the pain, Beato howled and tried to pull the stakes out with all her might......`
`If I can't pull these out, .........I'll die.........`
` ......This is.........the final counterattack...............`
`"Then Battler......`
` ......All my numerous displays of magic, .........how do you explain those......?`
` .........The very first time they appeared......was in the second game, when I fixed Maria's pumpkin marshmallow for her.`
` At that time, Rosa definitely witnessed that magic."`
`Certainly, Rosa had witnessed gold butterflies gather and fix a marshmallow by the miracle of magic.`
`"......*cackle*cackle*...`
` ......Rosa alone witnessing it isn't very credible, right...?`
` That's why I increased the number of witnesses to the uppermost limit.`
` ......Which is what......this last game was all about......"`
`"The summoning of my minions!`
` And those brutal magical murders!`
` All of them were witnessed by a great many people...!!`
` That is itself......proof that my magic exists...!!`
` How do you......explain that, Ushiromiya Battleee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eerr.........!!!"`
`".........Stalemate."`
`"...............Wh‐......whaat......?"`
`"‘Magic exists because magic exists’.`
` I believe the rules of our Braun tube trial say that that kind of argument doesn't work."`
`".........Ye‐......s, ...you're right.........`
` ......Heh.........mmhk...ghhh..."`
`"No matter who—!!`
` Or how many people—!!`
` Witness magic—!`
` That will never be proof of magic's existence!!"`
`"Whether all the magic you've shown exists or not, I can ignore it all and explain things with {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.`
` That's my inviolable right.`
` ......Am I wrong?"`
`At those words, the blue stakes let out an even brighter light, repelling my hands away.`
`......As I feared,`
` .........I can't pull them out after all.........`
` ............ggghh.........`
`As Battler is now, even if I cited each individual piece of magic and demanded an explanation for each, he would probably use any means available to him to deny all of them.`
`......Not just the marshmallow magic that I showed Rosa, ...but all of my magical miracles.`
`I can no longer even {i:claim} to be a witch without entering into debates about how something like a marshmallow was fixed...`
`I am in such an inferior position that I am forced to fight over trivialities like that......`
`It might be.........impossible for me.........`
`......I knew this...`
`This was a game without victory from the very beginning.`
`...So it was only natural that the day of my defeat would eventually come.`
`Have I fought Battler...`
`up until today...`
`......just in order to lose to him.........?`
`............I began these games...thinking I might be able to win.`
`Even if I wouldn't be able to win easily, I believed that in a game repeating endlessly, a miracle would eventually occur.`
`......After all, I had the absolute determination to win for certain.`
`......But now, I have completely lost that miracle.`
`And...absolute, certain determination resides in Battler, ......leaving {ruby:watashi:me} with no miracle for certain.`
`No, perhaps I should say with no {i:miracles or certainty}......`
`No victory, and no conclusion through a draw.`
`......The only resolution permitted is...`
`...defeat......and until it is given to me,`
` .........all I can do in this game is continue on resisting......`
`That's right, I'm...`
`......fighting.........only so that I can be killed by Battler.........`
`......I looked into Battler's eyes.`
`{n}It was not me inside them.`
`.........Reflected in those eyes were the figures of the little sister waiting for his return, ...and the family he had to bring back to her.`
`He no longer sees me......even as an individual.`
`...Of course he doesn't.`
` From the very beginning, he has been fighting to deny the individual I am.`
`............Ahh, ...that last game...`
` ...That was so much fun......`
`All it was was a little bit of a trick,`
` ......but for even just a short period of time, it felt like we understood each other, ......and it was so much fun......`
`......That's right,`
` ......I should have settled right there and then...`
`I should have continued for eternity with Battler totally fooled...`
`............But...`
`......that just wouldn't be any good, would it...`
` .........That...`
`just wouldn't be true victory.........`
`"............Is this......checkmate?`
` {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`Run through with several blue stakes, Beato was still in a standing position, skewered to the ground many times over.`
`Unable even to fall over because of this,`
` .........and still looking up into the sky, ......she was sewn in place......`
`Her tragic form might have been a fitting end...`
`...for the cruel witch who had endlessly toyed with 18 people's lives, and who had killed constantly for hundreds and thousands of years.`
`Gently, ......as though someone was mourning for something, ...rain began to fall.`
`......Amid that rain, Beato was exposed to the elements, ......crucified......`
`"......Is it over, Beato?"`
`"...............There is...`
`......nothing I can say........."`
`"No way you're done.`
` You aren't a woman who'll let things end with just this."`
`"........................`
` ..........Don't be...`
`.......unreasonable......`
` .........How can you look at me,`
` .........and think that this isn't...`
`......over......?`
` ......Hurry up and deliver the final blow........."`
`".........................................."`
`"...Just say it.`
` ...With your...blue truth.`
` ............‘Therefore,`
` ......witches do not exist’...`
`......`
` .........Just say it.........`
` ......With that single blow,`
` ......take my last...`
`............breath away........."`
`"That's no good."`
`"............Hoh......`
` .........You ask me to......continue subjecting myself to.........humiliation...`
` It is already settled......"`
`"Stand up.`
` Our brawl still isn't over."`
`"..................‘Still’, ......you say........."`
`"What I see there isn't you losing.`
` You've just resigned, decided you've had enough."`
`".........What's...wrong with that......`
` ......Resigning...`
` ......It still means your victory.`
` .........You should...`
`...return to your little sister...`
`right away......`
` Just abandon me,`
` .........right here........."`
`"Didn't I tell you?`
` I won't run away.`
` And...`
`I won't let you get away either."`
`"................................."`
`"Who are you?`
` And what in the world was your purpose?"`
`If you want to know, ......why don't you just try your favorite move......?`
`"...............What does it matter...`
` ...Just...`
`......a fantasy,`
` ......an illusion......`
` Can't you...`
`...leave it at that......?"`
`"That's no goddamn good at all.`
` I won't let you...`
`run away."`
`"......................................."`
`"I'm going to defeat you.`
` Like hell I'm going to let you escape."`
`"................................."`
`"I won't let you run back into the darkness of illusions, leaving you all vague like this.`
` .........I'm going to break through you.`
` Completely.`
` So on your feet.`
` Don't act all frail like that!`
` You're still hiding several moves!`
` I can tell!"`
`"...............Why......won't you just let me escape......?"`
`"Dad, Mom, and Ange.`
` All of my cousins and all of my relatives.`
` And all of the servants.`
` All those times you killed them, all those times you toyed with their lives...!!`
` I will never forget and I will never forgive your inhumanity!"`
`"I can still feel......Ange's arms on my shoulders...!!`
` I will {i:not} forgive your inhumanity...!!`
` So I won't let you get away like this...!!!"`
`Battler's eyes burned with the flames of hatred...`
`......The days when I could earn his passion by appearing frail are now a matter of the distant past.`
`......Having been tricked once, Battler will never sympathize with me again.`
`Never mind the wolves and sheep puzzle,`
` .........this is like the boy who cried wolf, isn't it...............`
`............What am I supposed to do.........?`
` .........What should I do............?`
`......I guess fighting endlessly just to avoid admitting defeat......is an endless torture fitting for the Endless Witch.`
`...............I guess endlessly harassing Battler to avoid giving him victory...is part of being the Endless Witch as well.........`
`...............It's so sad......`
`.........Is this really...`
`......the Endless Magic.........?`
`I've...`
`......had enough.........`
`Of endlessly...`
`......being made into a witch's plaything...`
` ............I've...`
`...had enough......`
`No victory, and no conclusion with a draw.`
`......In that case, there is only one conclusion that can release me.`
`......Heh, ......hahahahahahaha......`
`Since the time I descended to the path of witches.`
`Since the day I made that contract with demons.`
`.........Was it not promised that tragedy would be my ultimate fate.........`
`"What's wrong!!`
` Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` If you are the ruler of Rokkenjima, face your end with appropriate majestyyyyyy!!!"`
`Lightning.`
`......The world was smashed with white.`
`{n}.........Fitting last moments...for the ruler of Rokkenjima.`
`Haha, .........hahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha.........`
`"Hahhahahahahaha......wahha{0}hha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!!!"`
`"..........................."`
`Still pierced by the blue stakes, ......Beato faced the rainy sky, and let out a laugh.`
`Then she slowly raised her face, ......and fixed her eyes on Battler.`
`".........Fool.`
` ......I was considering handing you the victory in praise of your good fight...`
` .........You shall regret your complacency......"`
`"Victory is not something for you to hand over.`
` It's something I'm gonna snatch from you!!`
` And don't pretend you're any different!!"`
`"You couldn't accept victory being handed to you on a silver platter when I started saying stuff like "Maybe it's alright for witches to exist", and that's exactly why you intentionally fell apart like that in the end last time...!!!`
` That's right, that one time last game, you showed mercy on me!!"`
`"So now I'm making us even! Stand!!!`
` My enemy, my Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!!"`
`"Hahhahaha......`
` Idiot."`
`".........You idiooooooooooooot, hhahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!`
` Ssssimpleton...!!`
` Don't think you'll ever get another chance!!`
` Uuuaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aagh!!!"`
`When Beato yelled, the blue stakes that had been piercing her chest blew to bits and disappeared.`
`......However, the blue wedge that had pierced her foot in the very beginning did not disappear.`
`"You haven't pulled it out yet.`
` You haven't pulled out the blue truth of the 18th person X...!!"`
`"I will respond to one of your repetition requests.`
` As you reasoned,`
` {p:1:Kinzo is already dead at the starting time for all games}!"`
`"However, in that case, all I need to do is take one person out!!`
` {p:1:Thus far, I have been declaring that no more than 18 humans exist on this island}.`
` {p:1:I will lower that by one for Kinzo}!!"`
`"{p:1:No more than 17 humans exist on this island}!!`
` {p:1:That excludes any 18th person}.`
` {p:1:In short, this 18th person X does not exist}!!`
` {p:1:This applies to all games}!!!"`
`"I goddamn knew it.`
` You still had some crazy stuff up your sleeve after all......`
` This island only had 17 humans on it, but all this time, it's been made to look as if there were 18.`
` And now that we've taken one off and brought it down to 17, we've finally reached the correct number."`
`"............Now the wedge I knocked into you has been removed.`
` We'll have to start the fight over, back from square one...!"`
`The blue wedge that had sewn Beato in place broke apart.`
`{n}.........There was no longer anything piercing Beato.`
`The scars on her body had disappeared completely.`
`There, just as Battler had hoped for, ......stood the imposing figure of the Golden Witch who ruled Rokkenjima.`
`"......Now come, Battler.`
` Once more from the beginning.`
` Try to break through everything with the blue truth.`
` I too will no longer play, run, or hide."`
`"If you prove to be good for nothing, then I shall decide this match right here and now.`
` I will make you forever regret not settling for the victory I handed you!!!`
` Come, starting from the first game!"`
`"Right!!`
` From the first twilight of the first game!!`
` {p:2:There is nothing strange about the murder of the six relatives that were found in the gardening shed in the beginning}!`
` {p:2:The crime was possible for any of those who didn't have an alibi}!!"`
`"Valid.`
` Continue—what about the next locked‐room murder, with Eva and Hideyoshi?!`
` Even the chain was set for that locked room!`
` I shall add to the red truth."`
`"{p:1:Both deaths were homicides}!`
` {p:1:It is not the case that, after the construction of the locked room, one of them committed suicide after murdering the other}!`
` {p:1:Furthermore, the murder was carried out with both the victim and the perpetrator in the same room}!`
` {p:1:No method exists for the perpetrator to commit murder from outside the room}!"`
`"{p:2:Suppose that the culprit was a human without an alibi}.`
` {p:2:In other words, the dead}!`
` {p:2:Among the first six corpses, there were some made unidentifiable because their faces were smashed}."`
`"{p:2:One possible theory is that one was actually a fake corpse, and that some culprit X killed those two after pretending to be a victim and hiding away}!`
` {p:2:Then, after the locked‐room murder was constructed, the culprit hid under the bed, and waited for all of us to leave}!!"`
`"Very well, next!`
` Kanon, killed in the boiler room, correct?`
` I shall add to the red truth.`
` {p:1:All of the survivors have alibis}!`
` {p:1:Let us include the dead as well}!!`
` {p:1:In short, no kind of human or dead person on the island could have killed Kanon}!"`
`"{p:2:If no one could kill him, then he might have been the one to kill}!!`
` {p:2:Meaning Kanon‐kun might have killed himself}."`
`"Repetition requested!`
` "Kanon‐kun did not commit suicide"!"`
`"{p:1:Kanon did not commit suicide}."`
`"One more."`
`"Repetition requested, "Kanon‐kun's death was a homicide"."`
`"I decline to repeat."`
`"That refusal still admits the possibility of a homicide, but you've already declared in red that no one could have killed him.`
` In other words, it wasn't a homicide.`
` This is the same as the linked locked rooms from the third game."`
`"{p:2:Kanon‐kun died for a reason that was neither suicide nor homicide}.`
` {p:2:Though the circumstances are unclear, he died from an accident}."`
`"{p:2:By the Devil's Proof, I refuse to explain what kind of blunder could have led to an accidental death where a stake was driven into his chest}!!"`
`"Hohoh, now that you have borrowed the power of the devil, you are without peer!`
` It is valid!"`
`"In that case, what about the murders after that in the parlor, of Genji, Nanjo, and Kumasawa?!`
` Naturally,`
` {p:1:Maria, who was in the same room, did not kill them}!`
` {p:1:And of course, their three deaths were homicides}!"`
`"{p:2:We can explain it with the one who carried out the murder being a culprit X who used an unidentifiable corpse to disappear}.`
` {p:2:In the first place, their three faces were also pulverized}.`
` {p:2:It's completely possible that one of them was a body‐double corpse}!"`
`"{p:1:I guarantee the identities of all unidentified corpses}.`
` {p:1:Therefore, there were no body‐double tricks}!"`
`"{p:2:Then I can explain it with simultaneous murders}.`
` {p:2:Each of the three had a gun, pointed it at another in a clockwise pattern, and they blew each others' faces off at the same time}!`
` {p:2:After that, Maria collected those guns and hid them}!!`
` How about that?!!!"`
`"Wha‐......what a ridiculous argument!!!`
` I, I like it...!!`
` Then what about Natsuhi in the end?!"`
`"I shall add to the red truth!`
` {p:1:Natsuhi's death was a homicide}!`
` {p:1:There are no corpses of unknown identity, and all of the survivors have alibis}!"`
`"{p:2:You can explain it with an indirect murder by trap X}!`
` {p:2:Something was done to Aunt Natsuhi's gun}.`
` {p:2:You can explain it if that was a trap gun, built to send a bullet right into the forehead of anyone who tried to hold it up and shoot it}!!"`
`"{p:1:The bullet buried into Natsuhi's forehead was not fired from Natsuhi's gun}!"`
`"{p:2:There is the possibility that Aunt Natsuhi was lured out by that letter of unknown contents}!`
` {p:2:And she was called out into the hall}.`
` {p:2:Then, she was forced into standing at a specified location at a specified time, and murdered by some trap X, which used a gun that had been installed there beforehand}!!"`
`"Splendid!!`
` Your absurd arguments even feel pleasurable to me now!`
` I shall surrender the first game to you out of respect...!!`
` I am impressed!!"`
`"............Gaahaagh!!!"`
`The instant Beato admitted defeat in the first game,`
` the stakes of blue truth once again pierced her chest, letting out a terrible sound...`
`"......g......g'g'h............gaaaaghaahhh!!!`
` This much won't...stop me...... It's not over yet!!`
` Come, the second game!!"`
`Beato just barely pulled the stakes that had pierced her chest out,`
` ......but even though there was no hole left behind, it seemed to be a deep wound which let out a massive amount of blood.`
`And an intense pain of equal measure tormented her...`
`But Beato grinned, grinding her teeth, and pushed for the next game to start.`
`But I won't feel any sympathy.`
`......Just by her existing there, we will be killed and made to suffer over and over,`
` .........and Ange will be burdened with a future of isolation...!!`
`"That is correct, just by my being here and laughing, the eternal hell will continue...!!`
` I will not give you back to your sister...!`
` She can spend a thousand years crying over the family that is never to return...!!"`
`"Bastaaaaaard!!`
` No pity, no mercy! Here goes the second game!!`
` I'll start with the first crime!"`
`"I already saw through the locked‐room murder where the six were killed in the chapel at the time.`
` {p:2:Someone secretly borrowed Maria's key, and secretly returned it to Maria's bag after the crime was over}!!"`
`"{p:1:From the time Maria received her key to the instant Rosa unsealed the envelope the next day, the key did not pass into anyone's hands}!!"`
`"{p:2:There is the possibility that the door to the chapel had an auto‐lock just like Gramps's study}.`
` {p:2:In other words, it was unlocked before the crime, with a rock or something wedged in so that it couldn't close completely}.`
` {p:2:Then they gave the key to Maria}.`
` {p:2:Because the lock was automatic, it is possible to make a theory where the key wasn't needed}!"`
`"{p:1:No door with an auto‐lock exists other than Kinzo's study}!"`
`"{p:2:The victims locked the door from the inside}.`
` {p:2:One of the six was the culprit, and this person killed the other five, then pretended to be dead}!!"`
`"{p:1:The six were all already dead by the time they were discovered}!`
` {p:1:All of their deaths were homicides}!`
` {p:1:All six were pure victims; they did not take part in a mutual murder}!`
` {p:1:There were no simultaneous mutual murders}!!"`
`"{p:2:There existed humans with no alibi at the time, e.g. Kumasawa‐san}.`
` {p:2:If we assume that such a person killed the six, and was hiding inside, then there are no problems}!"`
`"{p:1:There was no one hiding in that chapel}.`
` {p:1:Therefore, your ‘killer hiding in the building’ locked‐room scenario does not hold}!"`
`"What's wrong, Ushiromiya Battleer, is that all?!`
` It's not so easy once you get to the second game, riiiight?!"`
`A tremendous exchange of red and blue truth.`
`The stakes and wedges of blue truth that I sent flying darted at Beato one after the other, and one after another, Beato cut them down with her red truth, her red treasured sword, knocking them out of the air.`
`But the blood she had lost from the first game was probably awful.`
` This intense exercise was putting her under even greater strain.`
`I could see her breath growing ragged.`
`That's why I can't hold back now!`
`{n}......I'll corner that witch!`
`And this time...I'll break through her!`
`"I'm not done yet... Yeah, that's no good, that's no goddamn good at all!!`
` My twisted logic isn't finished yet!!`
` Then what about this!!"`
`"{p:2:The food they were given had small bombs in it, which exploded from inside their stomachs}.`
` {p:2:In other words, the crime is possible through trap X}!`
` {p:2:The details of a bomb that they could swallow without noticing and that could blow open their stomachs is a Devil's Proof}!`
` {p:2:I refuse to explain}!!"`
`"Bfft...hahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha‐hahhaha‐hahha!!`
` What the hell is thaaaaaat?!`
` Small bommmmmmmbs?!`
` Waa‐hahhahaha‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"`
`But Beato failed to knock down the blue wedge as it flew at an angle like a curveball.`
`It let out a loud {i:thunk}, and gouged itself deeply into her left shoulder.`
`However, despite being on the receiving end of it, it seemed she couldn't stop laughing at how much of a curveball it was.`
`......Yeah, no wonder, even I'm amazed at how screwed up this reasoning is...!!`
`"Ha, laugh as much as you want!!`
` Is there a problem with it?!!"`
`"None!!`
` Your wild arguments are my pleasure!!!"`
`"And the next, the locked room with Jessica and Kanon?!"`
`"No problems there!`
` {p:2:If the culprit was one of the servants, they could have used a master key}.`
` {p:2:It's not even a locked room}!"`
`"After that, there was an attack in the servant room from a mystery person who seemed to be Kanon, and Nanjo and Kumasawa were killed, right?!`
` I had already declared Kanon's death in red before that time.`
` Then who was that Kanon?!"`
`"{p:2:If Kanon‐kun's death was declared with the red, there's no way he was alive}.`
` {p:2:Therefore, there is a chance that it was someone else in a disguise that would make the group that was attacked mistake this person for Kanon‐kun}!"`
`"{p:1:They would never mistakenly think any other person was Kanon}!"`
`"{p:2:Then, just like the heredity of Kinzo's name, there is a possibility that Kanon's name was inherited by someone}.`
` {p:2:You could suppose that Kanon‐kun was killed, a different person succeeded his name, and this person attacked them}!!"`
`A sound like a watermelon being squashed rang out, and a blue wedge was buried deep into Beato's left flank...`
`It looked like she felt that one—maybe it hit her in a bad spot.`
`After leaning over and moaning for a while,`
` ......she laughed it off as though trying to make it seem like no big deal.`
`Yeah, I can tell.`
` That must have hurt like a bitch...!!`
`"Hyahhaaaaaaaahhh!!`
` Once again, you've set up some {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} as the culprit as if it were nothing!!`
` You truly are gabbing on about things you would never say on the game board in a million years!!"`
`"But it is valid!`
` Your verbal assault tickles me!!`
` ......Such pleasure.`
` .........This is not pain, ......it is pleasuuuure!!"`
`When Beato howled, the wedge that had pierced her was blasted away.`
`{n}But the wound remained, and continued tormenting her with intense pain.`
`"You ready? I'll keep going.`
` The blue truth given for the final murders in the second game, the three who died in Aunt Natsuhi's room, should still be valid even with the 18th person X denied!`
` Do you have a counterargument for that in red?!`
` If not, the second game is all mine too!"`
`"No, nothing!!`
` It would be no fun at all to fight over such trivial matters!!`
` You may have it, you may have the second game!!"`
`"Gwaaaaaaaaagghghh!!!!`
` .........*gasp*, ......gwoo{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}oohhhh.........!!"`
`The instant she admitted defeat in the second game, this time two blue stakes gouged through Beato's chest...!`
`The witch's lungs were gouged, and her intestines.`
`{n}The witch's face twisted in anguish.`
`{n}Her body twisted as she gasped in pain.`
`"Does it hurt......?"`
`"Huuuuurt?`
` ......No, no, this just tickles.`
` Uhhya{0}hhya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hhya{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!"`
`"Compared to having your entire body torn to bits and turned into a pile of scrap meat, like your sister, that iiiiiiiiiiis?!`
` I'll make you scrap meat too, then you two siblings can be all mixed together like ground beef and pork, aaakkya{0}kkya{0}kkya{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!"`
`"U‐......uuurrraaaaaaaaaaaagggh!!`
` I'll beat you to death, I'll tear you to bits the same way!!`
` Next!`
` The third game!!`
` Come on, where's your energy?!!`
` This is where I knock you down to hell!!"`
`"......Guh......gah......ooooaagghhh!!`
` Naturally, as if I could let this wear me out!"`
`"Yes. It is still far from over!`
` Come, let us begin the third game, starting with the first six linked locked rooms!"`
`"You penetrated this locked room at the time, and by all rights it should have remained that way.`
` But then you went and {i:killed off Kinzo}...!!"`
`At the time, I hypothesized that Gramps was the culprit,`
` and that after killing the other five and stringing the keys across each room, he constructed his own locked room in the boiler room,`
` where, in the middle of carrying out some kind of scheme, he had an accident which resulted in him burning to death in the boiler.`
`But now I've gone and declared that Gramps was already dead.`
`{n}So I've denied my own theory.`
`{n}The irony...!`
` However—`
`"There's no problem!`
` {p:2:There are plenty of people who could have committed the crime besides Gramps}!`
` {p:2:You could even claim that the adults who were in the middle of a family conference at the time were all in on it and committed the crime together}!"`
`"{p:1:All five master keys were discovered, each in the pocket of one of the servants}!`
` {p:1:The individual room keys were found inside envelopes alongside the corpses}!"`
`"{p:1:In short, all keys related to the linked locked rooms were locked {i:inside} the linked locked rooms}!!`
` {p:1:No key could have been returned from outside the room using a crack in a door, a crack in a window, a vent or any place of the sort}!!"`
`"{p:2:Then they were killed with poison gas}!`
` {p:2:Even if a key couldn't pass through, gas could, right}?!`
` {p:2:The murder was carried out from outside the locked room}!!"`
`"{p:1:All of them had fatal wounds that appeared to be gunshot wounds}!`
` {p:1:Murdering them from outside the room would have been impossible}!!`
` {p:1:I shall say more with the red}!"`
`"{p:1:When the five other than Kinzo were killed, the killer was always in the same room as them}!`
` {p:1:I already declared in red at the time that there were no suicides}!!"`
`"{p:2:After the murder of each person in their respective rooms, the culprit constructed a linked locked room}.`
` {p:2:But there was no way for the culprit to return the key for the last room to the inside of the locked room}.`
` {p:2:But they did manage to return it}.`
` {p:2:The first person to discover a corpse just had to pretend to find the key and pull it from the corpse's pocket}!!"`
`She couldn't fully block that blue stake's retort...!`
` Pushed back by the blue wedges unleashed one after another, Beato finally failed to block one, and once again took a severe wound.`
`"Gi...ggi......gyaaaaaahhh!!"`
`As she howled in pain, she pulled out the blue wedge that had pierced her right arm.`
`......Beato's entire body had been slashed and pierced with blue wedges, stakes, and blades, over and over again,`
` and by now, her whole body was covered in blood.`
`But even so, Beato grinned.`
`{n}Cackled, as though she was enjoying it...!`
`"Fuhhahhahhaaaaaaahhh!!`
` How could a man who promised to come home to Ange with her parents speak of a theory where those parents are the culprit?"`
`"Fine by me, that's just fiine by meeee, you knoooooww?`
` You can be a big, happy family getting their hands dirty with mass murder,`
` and return to Ange stained with blood that will never come oooooooooff!!"`
`"Isn't that perfectly fitting for the survivors of the witch's islaaaaaaaaaand?`
` Just like that mincemeat Angeee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eehyahhaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhh!!!"`
`"Aaaaaarrrrgggghhh, shut uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuupp!!`
` I'll kill you!!`
` I'll tear you apart!!`
` Don't worry about begging for your life, I'll make sure you get the worst kind of death by my very own hands!!"`
`"Yes, you're capable of it, I'm sure...!!`
` I trust you to give me an end fitting for a witch who has explored the depths of cruelty over a thousand years...!!"`
`"Ooh, will it hurt?`
` Will it be hard to bear?`
` Or will it just ticckklllllleee?!`
` Is this supposed to torment me?! Come on, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeer, there are still mysteries leeeeeeeeeeeeft!!"`
`Beato had already countered my first powerful move, the 18th person X,`
` by making the number of people on the island 17.`
`But just limiting the number of people to 17 doesn't overturn the theory that Aunt Eva is the culprit.`
`I can crush most of the murders in the third game with that theory...!`
`Blood was dripping from all over the body of the Golden Witch......`
`{n}I was cornering her—and this time, completely without mercy.`
`This isn't a game played only to determine a winner and a loser.`
`{n}......Yeah, we're not playing around here.`
`Even just playing and fighting like this here.........delays the trip home.`
`In her isolation, Ange will continue to have her heart torn apart by loneliness and sadness...!`
`I have to go back to Ange as fast as I can!!`
`"............You're a mess.`
` Are you at death's door?"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*.`
` ......This is still far......from affecting me......`
` ......Something like this, .........nn.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*, it merely tickles...!!"`
`"Guess I don't need to show you any mercy."`
`"You were never going to in the first place."`
`"I'm going all out."`
`"I suggest you do.`
` When our roles were reversed, I showed you no mercy.`
` So you should do the same given the chance."`
`"Otherwise, I'll call another isolated Ange from a different world,`
` and this time I'll tear off her arms and legs, stick her with a spear and roast her, okaaaaaaayyy??`
` Uhhyahhaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhh!!"`
`"Shut uuuuuuuuuuup!!`
` Never again!!`
` Not my family!`
` Nor my relatives!`
` Nor any of the servants!!`
` Never again will you make any of them your toys!!"`
`"......I've already broken through all of the mysteries in the fourth game with the blue truth.`
` .........The only one left is the very last one from the third game.`
` ......Only the murder of Doctor Nanjo."`
`"......Oho, .........have I already been cornered so far......`
` ......*cackle*cackle*, I am in a precarious state, aren't I...`
` ......Iiihhihhihhihhi, ......ghagh, *cough*cough*!"`
`She coughed violently, spitting up blood.`
`......Her insides had been punched through so many times.`
` It was only natural.`
`"Which means that the mystery of Doctor Nanjo's murder is the last line of defense for you being a witch, right......?"`
`"............It would seem so.`
` If this is broken, it will mean that all of my mysteries have been broken.`
` .........Unless I counter one of your truths with some new red truth, or present a new mystery,`
` I...will die."`
`"........................`
` ......You don't look like someone who's been backed to the edge of the cliff.`
` ......You still have some kind of hidden pitch up your sleeve, right......?"`
`"Well, I don't know about that...`
` I have already tired of a life too long after a thousand years...!`
` I've started to think that it might not be so bad to have this life ended by a worthy adversary like you, who I met at the very end of it all."`
`"*cackle*cackle*, you {i:can} do it, I hope?`
` Do it.`
` ......Come onnnn, kill meeeee.`
` I'm always the one killing, and I've never had the experience of being kiiiiiilled!"`
`"I've killed the 18 of you hundreds of times, but I haven't been killed myself even once...`
` I wanna experience it at least once myseeeeeeeeelf, uuhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihii!!"`
`It was a graceless show of bravado, unchanged from before.`
`......But blood dripped from her mouth, her once beautiful dress was covered with holes,`
` and blood poured from all over her body, making her physical appearance look very different from her attitude.`
`Perhaps she was still suffering from the shot she'd taken to the flank—`
`the way she was unconsciously clutching it lacked any trace of elegance.`
`......But there's no room for compassion.`
` As long as I feel sympathy for this witch, my family and I won't be released from this place.`
`......Until I defeat her, we won't be able to go home...!!`
`In this world we live in, even people who see each other as enemies can come to understand each other if the situation changes.`
`But absolute evil does exist.`
` That is an evil which brings misfortune by its very existence, and is to be spared no compromise.`
`Just by continuing to exist, it is.........evil!!`
`"I do not feel sorry for you.`
` Just like you didn't feel sorry for any of us...!"`
`".........Well, of course.`
` All of you are just pieces in the game!`
` It's just unbelievably fun to think about which six to kill in the beginning, how to kill the next two,`
` and whether I can find a much, much more grotesque way of killing, you see{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eee??"`
`"Come on, Battler, I'll reform a little, so forgive me this time too.`
` And then I'll change the method of killing into something a little better, alright?`
` I'll listen to how you want them to be killed and in what order, alriiiiiight?"`
`"It's so much funnnnnn, toying with people's liiiiiiiiives!!`
` I'm sure you could think of a way, a way to turn Ange into a pile of scrap meat much, much moo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oore!!"`
`"Come, Battleeeeeer!!`
` Try to expose the truth of Nanjo's murdeeeeeeeer!!"`
`The 18th person X was destroyed.`
` But I won't give in...!!`
`{n}I'll stop that witch's breathing cold!!`
`The end of the third game.`
`It was declared in red that the four survivors at that point in time—Battler, Eva, Jessica, and Nanjo—`
`were all unrelated to Nanjo's murder.`
`And it was also declared that he was murdered directly, right before his eyes.`
`All other people had the strongest alibi of having their deaths declared in red......`
`............Without using the 18th person X, I have to...break through this......!`
`Think, don't stop thinking......!!`
` Her red doesn't only bind me, it's also supposed to be her weak point...!`
`I've got to somehow use it against her.........!`
`............That's right,`
` ......there's still a gap......!`
`{n}Yeah, ......this way, I can break through it.`
`{n}{f:5:Beatrice}'s legend of the witch is over.`
`"......True, the others probably were dead.`
` {p:2:However, the time at which their deaths were declared in red was not the instant Doctor Nanjo died}.`
` {p:2:Strictly speaking, it was in the fight between me and {f:5:Eva} after Doctor Nanjo's corpse was found}."`
`"`
`{p:2:In other words, if someone who was alive at the time that Doctor Nanjo was killed died before {f:5:Eva} proclaimed that death, you can sew right through that crack}!!`
` {p:2:In other words, it's like this}."`
`"{p:2:The culprit was among those people who were not confirmed dead prior to {f:5:Eva}'s declaration of the deaths,}`
` {p:2:and that person had managed to skillfully play dead in the beginning and wait for us to leave them alone}...!`
` {p:2:They made us think that they had died, while their death still hadn't been declared in red}."`
`"`
`{p:2:Then they killed Doctor Nanjo, ......and after that, they died for some reason}!`
` {p:2:Then after that, {f:5:Eva} declared their death in red}!!`
` That theory can explain Doctor Nanjo's murder!!"`
`How's that, {f:5:Beatrice}?!`
`When he forcefully asked that question, ......there was a terrible sound that could only be likened to that of a compressor,`
` and a blue stake as thick as a log...`
`...appeared from under the earth and skewered the Golden Witch, Beato, pulling her up into the air......`
`Ugly tearing sounds rang out one after another,`
` and each time, ......a blue stake or wedge appeared and impaled {f:5:Beatrice}'s body.`
`......When that finally ended...`
`...her tragic form was exposed there, pincushioned by more than ten stakes and wedges all over her body and dripping with blood, ......dangling and crucified......`
`......There was none of the dignity of the brutal witch who had sneered at the honor of the dead, and toyed with and killed hundreds of the living.`
`The rain, which had started falling at some point, ......quietly tormented the crucified witch......`
`As Battler heaved with his breathing, he waited for some kind of answer from the Golden Witch...`
`......Although it wasn't long,`
` it took the witch at least a little bit of time before she showed any signs of life......`
`"...............It hurts......`
`......it huuurts..............."`
`"......You got...what you...deserved.`
` ......Know a portion of the pain of all those you've murdered......"`
`Even as he said that, it seemed Battler had lost a little of his forcefulness at this extremely pitiful sight.`
`He couldn't help but avert his eyes from a woman exposed in such a brutal fashion,`
` ......even if she was his enemy.`
`But even so, .........unless he destroyed {f:5:Beatrice},`
` the battle...wouldn't end...`
`"............Battleer,`
` .........I beg you...............`
` ......*sob*..."`
`Huh......?`
` ......Beato let out a sob...`
`"......It hurts............`
` ......It really`
`.........huuuurts.........`
` .........End it......`
` .........End it.........`
` ......Even now, I still...`
`......can't die......`
` ...*sniff*......`
` .........It hurts so goddamn much,`
` .........and I still...`
`...can't die.........`
`.........hic...!"`
`"............What are you...`
`...asking...`
`...me to do...?"`
`"...............End it... .........`
` .........Release me.........from this pain............"`
`Beato's expression......was a soggy mess of blood and tears.`
`Certainly, Battler had been tricked by her at one point.`
` ......So he could probably have suspected her expression, and even her tears, of being an act.`
`However, .........Battler...believed those tears.`
`.........After all, those tears...`
`had the red of truth mixed in with them.`
`"......What do I do?`
` What do I have to do to end your pain...?"`
`"............I'm going to...`
`............lay everything...bare.`
` .........It will be...`
`......my...`
`heart."`
`"...Your heart............"`
`".........ll......me."`
`"...............Beato..."`
`"......Ki`
`...ll`
`......me......`
` ............Just...`
`......let`
`...me`
`......die.........`
` ......*hic*,`
` .........ueeeeeeee........."`
`Were those tears of pain and torment, ......or else...`
`Either way, that pitiful expression...`
`......was painful for Battler to look at, even after burning with such anger...`
`"......Quickly, .........go back......to...Ange........."`
`"It's not so that I can go back.`
` .........I'll grant your request...in order to stop your pain."`
`"...............Than...`
`...ou......`
` .........Battleeer.........`
` ...ooooooohhhh..."`
`With her last breaths, Beato summoned up all of her remaining strength,`
` and managed to close both of her hands into fists......`
`A red light began to gather at those fists.`
`......Then she lifted her arms,`
` .........as though wishing for something from heaven......`
`"......I know you.........can kill me...`
` .........Everything I am...`
` ...My heart......`
` .........Crush it.`
` ............Pierce it.`
` .........Okay......?"`
`The red light around both her arms got stronger and stronger......`
`"............Ple......a..........................."`
`She got that far into the word, ......and then her face tilted to the side a bit.`
`{n}Her right arm lost its light and flopped down.`
`......But her left arm alone did not lose its light, and remained held up towards the heavens.`
`Then, ............before Battler's eyes,`
` another Beato appeared with a faint form, transparent like a curtain.`
`......The crucified Beato had already lost consciousness.`
`However, the newly appeared faint Beato quietly looked at me,`
` ......her eyes expressionless,`
` ............and spoke, in an uncharacteristically polite tone.`
`".........`
`{p:1:Ushiromiya Battler}.`
` {p:1:I will now kill you}."`
`"..................And...?"`
`".........`
`{p:1:And right now,}`
` {p:1:there is no one other than you on this island}.`
` {p:1:The only one alive on this island is you}.`
` {p:1:Nothing outside the island can interfere}."`
`......I...understood.`
` This was the only thing left keeping {f:5:Beatrice} a witch—`
`the {i:final mystery}.`
`And Beato was holding it out to me.`
`{n}Entreating me......to solve her final mystery...`
`...and kill her......`
`"Come on......`
` I'll accept......your final mystery."`
`".........`
`{p:1:You are all alone on this island}.`
` {p:1:And of course, I am not you}.`
` {p:1:Yet I am here, now, and am about to kill you}."`
`"Like a souped‐up version of the mystery of Doctor Nanjo's murder......`
` .........So......?"`
`".........Who...am I...?"`
`"Is that...............your final question?"`
`{a:c:`
`"......Who...`
`...am I.........?"`
`}`
`Then, ......{f:5:Beatrice} slowly approached me, and held me, expressionless......`
`.........Yeah, I get it, Beato.`
`{n}I'll kill you.........don't worry.........`
`Slowly, I, too, held her head.`
`.........And then...my piece...`
`left the game board......`
`Scattered over the big bed were cute jellybeans of various colors,`
` and chocolate coins.`
`A fork was stuck into the shortcake peeking out of a gift box,`
` and there were decanters with drinks of various colors lined up on the side table.`
`But the venomous color of the drink poured into the glass matched none of the decanters.`
`Someone had probably been playing around, mixing them together.`
`The taste aside, that was a lot of fun to do.`
`On top of the fluffy bed were several colorful, big pillows stuffed with dreams.`
`And on this big bed that looked like something out of a child's dream world,`
` {f:5:Bernkastel} lay face down,`
` and {f:5:Lambdadelta} lay face up, hugging a pillow and relaxing......`
`"Ahahhahahhahhah, this one was a real rush, wasn't it?`
` I got re~ally anxious when Beato said she'd stop the game."`
`".....................What a rude witch, to start a game of this scale and try to end it by throwing it away."`
`"Wasn't Ange a good piece?`
` After Beato ran for it, Ange dragged her back and made her resume the game.`
` It's too bad that she gave Battler a bit too much enthusiasm, though."`
`"..................Because she knew Battler is weak against emotions."`
`"No kidding.`
` He looked like he might even go easy on his enemy Beato."`
`"............Based on the previous game, I was uneasy that he might start to feel compassion for Beato, and take the game in an odd direction.`
` .........Ange was a trump card to get Battler back on track if and when he mistook his goal."`
`".........In truth, I wanted to have her support him a bit more before playing her out.`
` She really did play and discard herself straight away.`
` What a waste for a piece that required so much preparation."`
`"Ehheheheh!`
` I'm so~ glad I shackled her with the rule about not giving her name!`
` If I hadn't set that up, the brother‐sister tag team would have swallowed Beato up and won in the blink of an eye."`
`"............I thought it was my chance to apply a lot of pressure at once,`
` but you were watching her so closely that I couldn't make the best use of her.`
` ......Aaah, what a waste that piece was."`
`"Well, yeah? That piece was super OP, I needed her out of there, like, yesterday.`
` Well, in the end, she did a good job of preventing the game from being suspended, I guess, and that helps me out too.`
` Her actions ended up matching both of our interests, so in that sense, she really was a wonderful piece."`
`"..................She was an innocent kid like Battler, so it was easy to get her to do as I said.`
` .........An idiot or an impulsive type, one of those two is always best for a piece.`
` ......Aaah, that piece really could have been so much more."`
`"And now she's mincemeat!`
` Hey, let's make hamburgers out of that later on{p:0:☆}`
` Oh wait, didn't you like gyoza more?`
` I wonder what little sister tastes like, *giggle*, so funny!"`
`"..................Is it really alright for you to be so relaxed?`
` Battler got fired up thanks to Ange.`
` He started going after Beato like a madman, and now, the game has taken a big turn to my advantage, I'd say...?`
` In fact, didn't Battler just solve almost all of the mysteries so far?"`
`"Huuh?`
` Not even clo~se!`
` Almost all of Battler's blue truth is wrong!`
` Beato's wishy‐washy red is full of holes.`
` Anyone with half a brain could slip through it easily just by rattling off some random BS."`
`"......Ahhh, that really ticked me off.`
` If that had been me, I'd have made sure to cut down every one of those things with the red."`
`"............Oh, really?`
` I was under the impression that those were all the correct answers.`
` ......Well, of course, I did have my suspicions about all that stuff to do with swallowing small bombs."`
`"And Battler's blue truths, not all of them were even valid.`
` ......Beato stated clearly that, within the first game, she`
` {p:1:guarantees the identities of all unidentified corpses}!`
` That breaks Battler's reasoning about the culprit of the Eva/Hideyoshi locked‐room murder being someone who used a fake corpse."`
`"Next, he said that Kanon's death in the boiler room was probably an accident, but...*giggle*!`
` What kind of accident could end up with him driving a stake into his own chest?`
` How dumb is that?`
` I'll slice it with that red treasured sword or whatever."`
`"{p:1:Kanon did not die in an accident}!`
` For the next one, the murders of the three including Genji in the parlor, the thought that it was a simultaneous murder where they shot each other in a clockwise pattern at the same time is laughable.`
` {p:1:Genji, Kumasawa, and Nanjo were not killers}!"`
`"The final trap X for Natsuhi's murder is really dumb, too.`
` {p:1:The thing that shot Natsuhi wasn't a trap, it was a real shooting murder with a gun raised and trigger pulled}!`
` *giggle*, my condolences...!"`
`"......Stop that.`
` You mustn't say something like that in red.`
` That kid's trying to make it so that she killed Natsuhi by bouncing Natsuhi's bullet back at her with magic."`
`"Oh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho, oopsie, you're right, I forgot...!`
` Even his blue truths for the second game were too naive."`
`"`
`{p:1:When the six were murdered in the chapel, the culprit was inside the chapel}!`
` That guy tries to explain every little thing with trap X.`
` What the heck is trap X, some weird mystery novel cliché?"`
`"And in the incident where Nanjo and Kumasawa were killed in the servant room, it's ludicrous to say that someone inherited Kanon's name.`
` {p:1:The only one who can go by the name of Kanon is the person himself}!`
` {p:1:No other human can adopt that name}!"`
`"And that theory about borrowing the master key from Rosa for Natsuhi's room is also worthless!"`
`"{p:1:After the master keys came into Rosa's control, never did any of them leave her hands}!`
` {p:1:Except for the time when she lent one to Battler to unlock Natsuhi's room}.`
` I could go on, but this is enough just for a quick look, I guess?"`
`"............A quick look? You've just denied Battler's blue truth for the first and second games across the board.`
` .........My, my, what a thing.`
` Battler would faint if he heard that."`
`"......See?`
` Beato wasn't cornered at all.`
` .........I always thought she was a pretty good actress."`
`"I'm sure the plan is to make it look like she got cornered this game,`
` and then sometime next game, swish!, she'll slice it in half with a single red stroke and make Battler's eyes pop out."`
`"*giggle*, and then I'm sure she'll say it with a huge grin on her face.`
` "A witch is never in trouble~"!`
` Pff, *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"...............Then that whole tragic feeling as though Beato was getting cornered was all an act?"`
`"Obviously?!`
` She really is a great actress!`
` Even though she wasn't cornered at all, it felt like a last‐episode climax to put everyone else to shame!"`
`"She's totally the winner for best supporting actress this year!!`
` Oh, but of course I'm the sta~r!`
` Or it could be you, Be~rn!"`
`"............At the end, she said things like "kill me" and laid out a big riddle.`
` Wasn't that her last stand, with Beato to be finished for good if that riddle was solved?"`
`"*giggle*giggle*...!`
` No way, you were tricked too, Bern?"`
`"That wasn't even close to a last stand!`
` Beato still has some hellishly brutal moves she's keeping hidden.`
` ......When she stuck out both arms to give the final riddle, did you notice how she brought her right arm back down?"`
`"......Ah, now that you mention it.`
` .........So that's what that meant."`
`"Sure is!`
` She still had plenty of hidden moves left!`
` And none of the mysteries have been solved...!"`
`"That tension, as though she'd been completely seen through and it was like "Tune in next time for the final episode!"`
` She truly is a genius at acting.`
` Ahh, I can't wait to see her knock Battler back down to rock bottom!"`
`"She's really taken to that "North Wind and the Sun Strategy" from the last game, I think!`
` I bet Battler will sympathize with Beato again and fall for it completely...!`
` A woman's single tear can trick a man, after all—now that's value, don't you think?!!"`
`"...............I wonder if Battler will get caught by that move again.`
` I must do my part too, and light a fire under Battler to never feel sympathy for her again.`
` ......Although Ange's mincemeat seems to have done that pretty well for the time being."`
`"A power‐up from an Ange‐flavored hamburger?`
` Oh‐hoho{0}ho{0}ho{0}ho{0}hoho!`
` Of course, I won't be beaten either.`
` I'll be giving Beato my full support so she can make enough of a comeback to compete with Battler."`
`"......She won't lose. Beato.`
` I mean, I've threatened her with a wonderful penalty if she does{p:0:♪}"`
`"..................Your penalties are genuinely no joke, so you should go a little easy."`
`"I've decided what to do next time I get to give you a penalty, Bern.`
` Wanna hear? Wanna hear?"`
`"No."`
`"Come o~~n, listen{p:0:☆}`
` Okay, here we go, here we go.`
` I'll lock you in a wonderful, wonderful castle."`
`"The castle will be surrounded by pure white castle walls, {nobr:12 km} to a side.`
` With a height of {nobr:10 m}.`
` No magic and no cheating allowed!`
` That's really not something you can jump over, right?"`
`"1,440,000,000 m³?`
` .........You can stop there, I already know what you're going to say."`
`"Eheheheheh!`
` And that place will start getting buried with gems, one every day!`
` And I'll lock you in it until the castle walls are packed with them, and you've been buried to death with gems.`
` Isn't that a wonderful, romantic penalty?"`
`"..................I'll let you multiply the length of the walls by five if you make the height one‐tenth its current height, and you can even shut me in it right now."`
`"Really?!`
` That would make it {nobr:3,600,000,000 m³}, you know?!`
` The penalty would take more than twice as long!`
` Aaahh, you'll be my prisoner for such a long time?!`
` I love you Bern, I really love yo~u{p:0:♪}"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} playfully clung to {f:5:Bernkastel}, who yawned, looking bored, as she stroked {f:5:Lambdadelta} under the chin as though playing with a cat...`
`"So you're betting on Battler to win.`
` And I'm betting on the two of them getting draws forever.`
` ............Isn't anyone going to bet on Beato to win?"`
`".....................It won't be me.`
` Her chances of winning are zero."`
`"Oh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!`
` It must hurt to be told by the Witch of Miracles that there's zero chance of a miracle!`
` I wouldn't bet on her either, of course.`
` For certain!"`
`".........It must hurt to be told by the Witch of Certainty that it's certainly no good, as well."`
`Unusually for them, they giggled together...`
`"I wonder what kind of conclusion this game's gonna have...?"`
`"...............Now that, at least, we can't predict.`
` ...That's why it's fun, after all."`
`"I won't allow any more escaping or suspending the game.`
` I'll make them continue the game for certain, and I won't let them run away...!`
` I can't even imagine how things are gonna unfold now,`
` but I do know one way it's certainly not going to end."`
`"..................At the very least, we know it won't end with Beato's victory."`
`"I mean, think about it.`
` Neither you nor I...`
`are betting on Beato to come out the winner!`
` Which means, if it looks like Beato is gonna win, she'll be making enemies of both of us Great Witches...!"`
`".........Pretty much.`
` Our powers are most in balance only when things are somewhere between a draw and Battler's advantage.`
` If it tips too much in Beato's favor, both of us will align along the same vector, and drag Beato back."`
`"So the instant Beato finds herself on top, ......she'll have both of us as enemies to deal with.`
` .........Ehheheheheh!`
` A common front with Bern, sounds fu~~n{p:0:♪}"`
`".........Thanks.`
` ......But I'm not taking a konpeitou candy bath with you."`
`"Aaa~w, but I thought we could take a konpeitou shower together,`
` while I cover you all over with melted marshmallows..."`
`".........That poor girl.`
` She's a living toy, a doll that you caught so that you could play with me."`
`"I'm good at playing with dolls.`
` ......I really can play with them well, you know?`
` I'm proud of being able to get hundreds of years of playtime out of a single toy without getting tired of it."`
`"............You're her ally at some times, and oppose her at others,`
` toying with her forever.`
` ......I feel sorry for her. That kid is our doll, now."`
`"Ehheheh, that's right, that kid is our doll.`
` No end is prepared for her except the ones the two of us wish for."`
`"So I can say for sure that this can only end with either an eternal draw because of me,`
` or Beato being defeated and destroyed because of you.`
` ............Heheh, ...as far as this game ending with Beato's victory goes..."`
`"...............I will proclaim it as the Witch of Miracles."`
`"Then I'll proclaim it as the Witch of Certainty."`
`""Beato certainly cannot win.`
` And there will be absolutely no miracles.""`
`""Ahhahahahahahahahahahahaha......!!""`
